Wigo is a repairman of bicycles. He is a kind and gentle soul, who always wears a short peak cap and a red scarf. When he's not fixing bikes, he loves to spend time with his pet cat, Kuro, and practice playing his guitar. Wigo may seem shy at first, but once you get to know him, he's a true friend who will always be there for you!
