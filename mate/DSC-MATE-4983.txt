SCP-4983, also known as "The Electrician", is a human male with distinctive facial features. His face is marked by a constellation of spots, while his mouth holds a perpetually frightened expression. His eyes are obscured by ski goggles, making it difficult to discern their true nature. The Electrician dons a police cap upon his head and wears a red scarf around his neck. His most noticeable accessory, however, is an LED gas mask that covers his lower face.

SCP-4983's personality is characterized by tremendous drive and decisiveness. He has a no-nonsense attitude that can come across as bossy or intimidating to others. Nevertheless, his ultimate goal is to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of any task he undertakes. His perfectionist approach sometimes leads him to obsess over details, but his thoroughness allows him to diagnose and fix problems quickly.

SCP-4983's specialization as an electrician affords him a unique skill set, enabling him to manipulate and control electrical currents in complex ways. While he avoids drawing attention to his abilities, his mastery of electricity remains a closely held secret. SCP-4983's unique skill set and driven character make him a valuable asset in urban fantasy environments where electrical power is critical to survival.
