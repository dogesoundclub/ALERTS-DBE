Description: SCP-4985 appears to be a female human, identified as an electrician by profession. SCP-4985 is approximately 1.57 meters tall and weighs 51.7 kilograms. SCP-4985 possesses unique physical characteristics, including spots on their face and blue clown eyes. SCP-4985â€™s head resembles that of a 00s school girl, and a goggle can be seen attached to the forehead.

SCP-4985 also wears a gold chain and a normal gas mask, the purpose of which is currently unknown. When spoken to, SCP-4985 exhibits a neat and detail-oriented personality. They appear to have a compulsion towards over-organizing their surroundings, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet.

SCP-4985's compulsion to detail has manifested in unexpected ways, leading to an increase in their anomalous capabilities. These include the ability to manipulate the electronic devices, particularly those requiring wires and cables or electrical impulses for their operation. SCP-4985 has displayed the ability to convert any source of electricity into creative energy, which they can use to control nearby electronic devices. SCP-4985 has also displayed an impressive knowledge of electrical engineering, which enables them to construct and deconstruct complex machinery structures.

SCP-4985 presents a significant potential threat due to their anomalous powers, as they can be used to take control of critical electronic systems that are essential for daily operations. Until further notice, SCP-4985 is to be kept under close observation by Foundation personnel, and no interaction must take place without clearance from senior-level personnel.
