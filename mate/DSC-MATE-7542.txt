Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7542 is to be employed by a Foundation-owned fast food restaurant as a cashier. SCP-7542's shift will be from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays, and will be allowed to roam freely within the restaurant outside of work hours.

Description: SCP-7542 is a male monkey of the species macaca fascicularis. SCP-7542 displays an otherwise atypical sense of communication skills and empathy, as demonstrated by the inherent ability to pick up on the emotions of others. The specimen's personalized purple cap and horned rim glasses serve as its primary means of expression, complemented by its use of its mobile headset when necessary. SCP-7542 does not appear to be affected by radiation or toxin exposure, nor does it exhibit any abnormal behavior or characteristics.

SCP-7542 has a personality that is easy-going and optimistic, with a proclivity for socializing and aiding others in emotional recovery. SCP-7542 has been observed to exhibit a skill for neutralizing stressful situations, channeling humor and positivity as needed. The specimen's gold chain and cigarette have been noted as trivial indulgences, though behaviorally insignificant in nature.

Addendum 7542-A:
During a Foundation investigation of a nearby elementary school, SCP-7542 was mistakenly identified as a missing child of the same name. After the discovery of SCP-7542's anomalous qualities, null-classed amnestics were administered to those involved to prevent any security breaches. SCP-7542 has stated that it does not have knowledge of its origins or the circumstances under which it was first discovered.
