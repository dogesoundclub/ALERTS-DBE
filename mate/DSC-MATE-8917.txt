SCP-8917, also known as "The Tigris Flame," is a male tiger of exceptional size and strength, standing at a towering 2.5 meters tall on all fours. The subject's imposing physique is accentuated by his black-striped orange fur, which appears to shimmer like flames in even low light conditions.

Despite his fearsome appearance, SCP-8917 bears a frightened look on his face at all times, with his jaws locked in a permanent snarl. His normal glasses, affixed over his intense gaze, suggest a need for corrective lenses, but it remains unclear whether this is a requirement for his species or a result of his anomalous properties.

SCP-8917 is dressed in a standard firefighting jumpsuit, emblazoned with the emblem of Site-17. The subject's head is covered by a hooded sweatshirt, which obscures his facial features and reinforces his intimidating presence.

Among SCP-8917's most notable accessories is a thick gold chain, which hangs around his neck and appears unbreakable even under extreme stress. This chain serves as a reminder of his service to the Foundation, and aids in the containment of his abilities.

SCP-8917 displays a deep curiosity about the world and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics, often spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others in a manner that can be both entertaining and disconcerting. Despite his verbose nature, the subject can be incredibly reserved and prone to bouts of fierce isolation.

Researchers should approach SCP-8917 with caution, as his innate strength and unbridled curiosity can lead to unpredictable behavior. Under no circumstances should the subject be released from his containment unit without prior approval from Foundation personnel.
