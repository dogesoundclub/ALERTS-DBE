SCP-700, also known by her political alias, is a human female with distinctive facial features. She is easily recognizable by the spots on her face and her striking red lips. However, the most unsettling aspect of SCP-700 is her piercing blue clown eyes, which have been known to induce feelings of unease or even fear among some witnesses.

Additionally, SCP-700's unique style choices include a bucket hat on her head and a silver chain as an accessory, further adding to her highly notable appearance.

Despite her intimidating appearance, SCP-700 is known to be a highly nurturing and caring individual. She is often seen taking care of those around her, treating friends and family members as if they were her own children. While this is often viewed as a humorous quirk, it is important to note that SCP-700's level of attachment to those she cares for can sometimes border on obsessive.

As with all SCP entities, caution and careful observation should be exercised when interacting with SCP-700 to ensure the safety of both the subject and any potential witnesses.
