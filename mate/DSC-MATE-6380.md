Item #: 6380

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6380 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. The subject is allowed to practice law, but must return to Site-17 at the end of their designated workday. Any instances of emotional manipulation on the part of the subject must be reported immediately to Site-17 personnel for investigation.

Description: Item 6380 appears to be a female human, with distinctive spots on their face and a bright red lip. They wear normal glasses and sport a two-color band on their forehead. They are often seen with a single jade earring in one ear. 

The subject displays a strong sense of empathy, and has the ability to tune into the emotions of those around them. This ability allows the subject to provide comfort and emotional support to those in distress, making them a valuable asset to their clients. However, the subject's empathetic abilities have been known to create uncomfortable situations, as they have been known to manipulate the emotions of others to achieve their goals. 

The subject's behavior around others is generally amicable, but they can display cunning and ruthless behavior when pursuing their career goals. Despite their manipulative tendencies, they display a sense of humor that is often relied upon to lighten the mood in difficult situations. 

Addendum: Item 6380's legal victories have often been the result of their ability to sway the emotions of judges, juries, and opposing counsel. While their methods are not always ethical, their results cannot be argued with. The Foundation is currently investigating the possible use of Item 6380's abilities to defend the Foundation's interests in court.
