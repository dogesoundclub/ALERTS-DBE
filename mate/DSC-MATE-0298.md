Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-298 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to basic amenities. Due to his role as a police officer, he is permitted limited outside contact but must be accompanied by Foundation security at all times. DSC-MATE-298 is to wear a medical mask and is to avoid physical contact with individuals, as his ability to sense emotions can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous outcomes.

Description: DSC-MATE-298 is a male human with spots on his face and a frightened mouth. His eyes are composed of VR Jade LED technology, and he wears a purple cap with a headset, a gold earring, and a red scarf. Although he appears like an ordinary police officer, DSC-MATE-298 possesses a unique ability to sense and manipulate emotions. He has a strong sense of empathy that allows him to connect with others on an emotional level.

DSC-MATE-298's ability can be both a gift and a curse.
