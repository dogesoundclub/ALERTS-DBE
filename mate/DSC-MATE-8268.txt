Addendum: A strange occurrence was observed during the live broadcast of SCP-8268 on █/██/20██. During the broadcast, the viewers claimed to have seen the monkey broadcast his own body as a three-dimensional holograph with the front layer depicting the presenter's face while the rest of the body was zooming in and out of the screen. The phenomenon lasted for approximately ten seconds before disappearing. The incident remains under investigation by the containment team.
