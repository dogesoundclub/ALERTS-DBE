Special Containment Procedures:

Containment of DSC-MATE-5075 is to be done through standard cover-up procedures that include passing it off as a regular human being. However, personnel are not to engage in any conversation that might reveal significant information regarding the Foundation or its activities.

Description:

DSC-MATE-5075 appears to be a normal human male in his thirties, of average height and build. The subject has a unique mouth spot, which is a small freckle at the corner of his lips, to the top right side. His behaviour is remarkably cordial and unremarkable, aside from his rainbow-field VR LED augmented reality contact lenses and gold earring in his left ear.

DSC-MATE-5075's most notable feature is his humorous facial expressions, which include a smile that can turn a stressful situation into one that feels cheerful. His accessory is a candy stick that is nearly always in his shirt's front pocket. 

Personality:

DSC-MATE-5075 is bound by his sense of duty as a firefighter. He extends this responsibility to civilians and colleagues alike, to a fault. DSC-MATE-5075 tends to take on tasks beyond his capabilities every single time he deploys for fire emergency services. His behaviour portrays a hero-like ideal, often humorous, that can undermine his fellow firefighters' efforts, frustrating yet inspiring them to push their limits to keep up with him.

He tends to avoid confrontation and often diverts attention away from himself, acting as a decoy in the process. The exact reason for this behaviour is currently unknown.

Addendum:

Owing to DSC-MATE-5075's remarkable resilience and charisma in emergency situations, as well as his unique enhancements, he is being monitored as a potential recruit for MTF Ï‡-13 or Mobile Task Force Whirlwind. Despite this, DSC-MATE-5075 is still required to remain within his job as a firefighter as attempts to extract him from his civilian life may cause damage to Foundation operations.
