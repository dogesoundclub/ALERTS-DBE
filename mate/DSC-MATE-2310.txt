Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2310 is to be contained within its train engine compartment at all times when not operating a train. The compartment must be secured with reinforced steel walls and locked from the outside. In addition, SCP-2310 is not permitted to operate a train that is carrying any Foundation personnel or SCPs. Any attempt by SCP-2310 to access these personnel or SCPs is to be met with immediate neutralization.

SCP-2310 is a train driver who operates transportation through various urban areas. SCP-2310 appears to possess a high level of intelligence and is capable of communicating through speech with human beings. Further, SCP-2310 exhibits a strong desire for harmony and social connections, often engaging in playful banter and telling jokes.

However, SCP-2310 also possesses a goofy and mischievous side which can result in humorous but potentially dangerous situations, particularly when interacting with other SCPs or Foundation personnel.

SCP-2310 was initially discovered operating a train in urban areas, where it had developed a significant following in the local population. Following reports of strange occurrences associated with the train's operation, the SCP Foundation was alerted and SCP-2310 was contained.

Addendum: SCP-2310 has been observed attempting to communicate with other SCPs in containment. As such, all interactions between SCP-2310 and other SCPs must be closely monitored and limited to prevent any potential harm to Foundation personnel or SCPs.
