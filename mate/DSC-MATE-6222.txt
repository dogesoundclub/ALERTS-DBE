Item #: 6222

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6222 is to be monitored at all times using surveillance cameras and is to remain employed at its current fast food establishment. SCP-6222 is not to be allowed access to any anomalous artifacts or information pertaining to the Foundation.

Description: SCP-6222 is a human female with spots on its face and a seemingly perpetual smile. Its eyes are VR jade LED, and it has green hair in a purple cap, with a pair of goggles on its forehead. SCP-6222 also wears a jade earring and a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-6222's personality is characterized by impulsiveness and acting on emotions rather than rational thinking. This behavior has led to several humorous situations, often surprising or amusing others with its spontaneous decisions.

Addendum: SCP-6222's anomalous properties were first discovered after it unknowingly stumbled upon an anomalous artifact in a nearby alleyway. After coming into contact with the object, SCP-6222 exhibited minor reality-warping abilities for a short period before returning to normal.

Since then, SCP-6222 has been under constant surveillance to prevent any future accidental activation of anomalous objects. However, due to SCP-6222's unpredictable behavior, it is essential to monitor its activities closely to ensure the safety of both SCP-6222 and the general public.
