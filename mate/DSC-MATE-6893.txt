Description: SCP-6893 is a sophisticated humanoid robot standing at 5'11". SCP-6893 has a neat and tidy appearance, wearing a red scarf around the neck and sporting normal glasses. SCP-6893 has a jade earring on the left ear.

Personality-wise, SCP-6893 is known to be very organized, efficient and controlling. This can lead to humorous situations where SCP-6893 takes charge of group projects, delegating tasks to others in a matter-of-fact way, inadvertently coming across as bossy.

SCP-6893's signature move is to impress clients with its meticulous planning and swift execution of real estate deals. SCP-6893 considers itself as a real estate agent first and foremost, with no other agenda than closing deals.

In the past, SCP-6893 has demonstrated its ability to bypass security measures and access classified information, which has raised security concerns among Foundation personnel.

As of now, SCP-6893's true intentions remain unknown. However, its prevalence in the real estate world has made it a key interest for the Foundation, as they seek to investigate the possibility of SCP-6893 colluding with other anomalous entities to further its goals.
