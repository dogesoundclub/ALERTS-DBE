Description: SCP-4429 is a human female with red clown eyes, likely caused by a genetic mutation. They typically wear a retro cap with a 2 color band on the forehead, gold earrings and a gold chain. SCP-4429's most distinguishing feature is an LED gas mask that they always wear, citing a sensitivity to pollution and an affinity to electronics.

SCP-4429's electrician skills are exceptional, as they are able to repair and maintain any electrical equipment with ease. However, SCP-4429 is also known for their love of debate and quick wit. They frequently engage in playful arguments with friends and family members, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-4429's personality can come off as abrasive to those who do not understand their passion for debate.

Interactions with SCP-4429 should be limited and brief, as prolonged debates can hinder mission objectives. Any attempts to harm SCP-4429's electronic equipment should not be tolerated, as they are crucial to their mental health and containment.
