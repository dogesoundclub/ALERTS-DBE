Item #: 4076

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4076 is to be kept under constant observation in their designated enclosure. Any interaction with 4076 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Access to 4076 requires Level 2 clearance and the wearing of appropriate protective gear.

Description: 4076 is a sentient tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall when upright. Their physical appearance is further accentuated by their unique accessory items. 4076's eyes appear similar to ski goggles which, behaving as actual goggles, do not impede their vision in any way. An odd Doge hat protrudes from their head, often giving the impression of a strange fusion between a tiger and a canine. Two jade earrings dangle from 4076's ears, bouncing back and forth as they move. Around their neck, a gold chain decorates them.

4076 has shown the ability to communicate verbally in English, albeit with slight difficulty as their vocal cords are not designed for human language. Despite this, 4076 has exhibited proficiency in using language thanks to the supplied technology.

Personality: While 4076 typically maintains a calm and collected demeanor, they are surprisingly spontaneous when prompted. They are an organized individual and can often be seen with a notepad, jotting down notes and ideas. However, the practicality of their ideas is questionable. Their extroverted nature can lead to hilarious situations, exemplified by their unplanned parties and lack of foresight. 

Addendum: 4076 was discovered on a farm in the outskirts of [REDACTED]. The Foundation was notified when local authorities discovered 4076's unique characteristics. Researchers are still investigating how 4076 gained their unique consciousness and distinct items of clothing.
