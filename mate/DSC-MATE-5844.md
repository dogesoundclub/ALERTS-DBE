Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5844 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-19. Access to the subject is to be granted by Level 2 personnel or above. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-5844 to remove its gas mask are to be met with immediate disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-5844 appears to be a human male of average height and build, identified as a lawyer. The subject is adorned with a red scarf and a gas mask, the latter of which interferes with speech and facial recognition. DSC-MATE-5844 often wears a retro cap, a goggle on its forehead, and nerd glasses. The subject displays a frightened facial expression, with its mouth often agape.

DSC-MATE-5844 displays a personality that values harmony and social connections above all else. Despite its reclusive nature, the subject has a goofy side, often engaging in playful banter and telling jokes to others. DSC-MATE-5844 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, but becomes nervous when confronted with high-risk situations.

The Foundation has hypothesized that DSC-MATE-5844's gas mask is linked to its fearful behavior. The subject claims that the mask is needed to filter out toxins from the environment, but this has not been further substantiated by Foundation testing. DSC-MATE-5844's scarlet scarf, while not anomalous, has been noted as an object of affection for the subject.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5844's legal documents have been reviewed and found to be mundane. The subject has not displayed any anomalous abilities or properties. Foundation agents have initiated a search for any possible anomalous manifestations related to DSC-MATE-5844's past clients or associates. No further information is available at this time.
