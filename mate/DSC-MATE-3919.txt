SCP Foundation File #3919: "The Mechanic"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3919 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-3919 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Personnel are advised to avoid making jokes or using humor around SCP-3919, as it may cause unpredictable behavioral changes.

Description: SCP-3919 is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on their face. They wear normal glasses and a red scarf around their neck at all times. SCP-3919's head has been replaced with a metal prosthetic, colored purple, and features a green cross earring on their left ear.

SCP-3919 works as a mechanic, and has demonstrated an aptitude for repairing and manufacturing machines and devices. Subjects who interact with SCP-3919 report a friendly and lighthearted demeanor, often marked by humor and jokes.

SCP-3919's personality is highly mutable, and can shift rapidly based on context and stimuli. While generally friendly and approachable, SCP-3919 has been known to lapse into unpredictable episodes of rage or depression, often triggered by memories or stimuli related to a former partner. These episodes typically require sedation and physical restraint to subdue.

Addendum: Following Incident-3919-A, in which SCP-3919's emotions caused a containment breach and resulted in significant property damage, research into the possibility of dampening SCP-3919's emotions is under consideration. However, given the positive interactions SCP-3919 has had with personnel when stable, such measures are still under review.
