Special Containment Procedures: 4030 is to be treated as a typical human and allowed to engage in normal activities within the confines of their designated containment area. All medical equipment and supplies are to be made available to 4030 for the purposes of administering medical aid if required. Direct contact with 4030 must not occur unless necessary, as they have been known to carry and transmit dangerous pathogens.

Description: 4030 is a human female who appears to be in her mid-thirties. They have light-colored spots of varying shades on their face, which give them a unique and striking appearance. Their facial expression is typically that of a broad smile, which can be unsettling to some individuals. Their blue clown-colored eyes are distinct and add to their eccentric appearance. Their headwear consists of a headset which has built-in LED lights.

4030 typically wears a medical mask, which is a precaution against the spread of disease. Despite this, they possess a magnetic personality and a quirky sense of humor that can be infectious to those around them. They have a tendency to make witty observations and tease their friends in a dry, deadpan manner. Their analytical and logical nature makes them a valuable asset in any medical scenario, but it can also make them appear detached, which some people may find disconcerting.

Addendum: 4030 has a history of exposure to various pathogens and has been known to carry them, making them a potential biohazard. All personnel should maintain a safe distance from 4030, and proper protective equipment should be worn when coming into contact with them or any of their belongings.
