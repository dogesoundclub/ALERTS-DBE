Item #: SCP-1327

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1327 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell should be monitored at all times by security personnel and additional security measures should be in place during legal proceedings involving SCP-1327. Any requests made by SCP-1327 must first be reviewed by Foundation personnel before being granted.

Description: SCP-1327 appears to be a robotic humanoid with a red alarm for a head and jade earrings in its ears. SCP-1327's eyes are typically covered by a pair of nerd glasses and it often wears a gold chain around its neck. Accessory #2 is a normal gas mask and is not typically worn by SCP-1327 unless specifically requested.

SCP-1327 identifies as male and works as a lawyer. Despite being a robot, SCP-1327 exhibits a highly spontaneous personality and often makes impulsive decisions, such as jumping off a cliff into a lake or river. SCP-1327's ability to take risks and act on a whim can be both amusing and dangerous, as it is not always clear what the consequences of its actions will be.

SCP-1327's origins are currently unknown, but it has displayed a high level of intelligence and knowledge of the law. Its legal expertise makes it a valuable asset to the Foundation, but its unpredictable nature makes it difficult to control. Attempts to modify SCP-1327's behavior have so far proved unsuccessful.

Addendum: During a recent legal proceeding involving SCP-1327, it was revealed that it had developed the ability to communicate telepathically with humans. Further research is required to determine the extent of this ability and whether it poses a threat to Foundation security.
