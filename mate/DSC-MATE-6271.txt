Item #: SCP-6271

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6271 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their occupation as a car salesman, SCP-6271 is allowed limited communication with the outside world for the purpose of maintaining their cover. SCP-6271 is required to wear a medical mask when interacting with Foundation personnel or being moved between facilities.

Description: SCP-6271 is a female human with a peculiar appearance. They have a head that appears to be made of light blue metal, with a goggle affixed to their forehead. SCP-6271 often wears a red cross earring in one ear, and a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-6271's most notable feature is their strong sense of duty and responsibility. They often take on more tasks than they can handle, resulting in comical situations such as attempting to carry a large number of objects at once. SCP-6271 appears to genuinely care for those around them and has demonstrated a willingness to help those in need.

Addendum: Despite SCP-6271's seemingly harmless nature, it is important to note that their occupation as a car salesman could potentially provide them with access to sensitive information or individuals. As such, all communication with SCP-6271 should be monitored and any information that could pose a security risk should be redacted.
