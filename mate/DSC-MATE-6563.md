Description: DSC-MATE-6563 was a human male of caucasian ethnicity, identified as a Lawyer by profession. DSC-MATE-6563 possessed several notable physical features, including a series of spots across his face and a blue bandana worn atop his head. In place of what would normally be human eyes, DSC-MATE-6563's face was outfitted with a set of Virtual Reality Jade LED's, allowing for advanced augmented reality capabilities.

DSC-MATE-6563 exhibited a markedly introspective personality, often spending long periods of time lost in deep thought and daydreaming. This behavior was known to result in situations of self-harm, such as accidentally colliding with objects or stumbling over obstacles while lost in thought.

After being deemed a possible anomalous entity, DSC-MATE-6563 was detained and placed under extensive study by the Foundation. It was eventually determined that DSC-MATE-6563 had acquired his unique physical traits and augmentations through an unexplained and anomalous ritual, the nature of which remains unknown.

Addendum 6563-A: Following extensive experimentation and investigation, DSC-MATE-6563 was deemed to pose no significant risk to Foundation operations or the general population. As such, DSC-MATE-6563 was neutralized on ██/██/20██ and all personal effects were incinerated according to standard protocol.
