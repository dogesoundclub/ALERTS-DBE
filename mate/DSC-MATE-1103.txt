Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-1103 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-1103 is only permitted to Level 2 personnel or above with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1103 is to be fed a diet of raw meat and provided with suitable toys for entertainment. Any attempt to harm SCP-1103 will result in immediate disciplinary action.

Description:
SCP-1103 is a tiger of the Bengal subspecies, measuring approximately 2.5 meters in length and weighing approximately 240 kg. SCP-1103's head is covered by a brown camouflage bucket hat, with a two-color band and goggles on its forehead. Its ears bear a red cross earring, and it wears a red scarf and carries a candy stick.

Personality:
SCP-1103 is highly ambitious and goal-oriented, often taking on more than it can handle due to its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills. SCP-1103 is known for its strong work ethic, dedicating long hours to its job as a banker. However, it has been observed to have a short temper when it comes to inefficiency and incompetence in others.

SCP-1103 has shown a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel but has expressed frustration with its containment. SCP-1103's desire to move up the corporate ladder and become a top executive has caused it to view its containment as a hindrance to its career goals.

Addendum:
SCP-1103 was discovered when a group of police officers witnessed it completing a bank heist alongside four other anomalous individuals. The individuals were apprehended, but SCP-1103 was captured by the Foundation during its escape attempt. Further investigations have revealed that SCP-1103 was the mastermind behind the heist and solely responsible for its success. SCP-1103's high cognitive abilities and strategic thinking make it a valuable asset to the Foundation if cooperative.
