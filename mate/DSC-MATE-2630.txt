SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2630 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to the internet and technological devices is allowed for recreational and employment purposes, but subject is not to be provided with any information regarding the anomalous. All topics of conversation with subject must be monitored and recorded for further analysis.

Description: Subject 2630 appears to be a human male in his mid-twenties with striking green hair and a purple cap on his head. His ski goggle-like eyes have been surgically implanted and are believed to enhance his visual acuity. The subject is frequently observed smiling, offering candy sticks, and spouting off random trivia in social situations.

Personality: Subject 2630 is highly intelligent, charismatic, and curious. He displays an insatiable thirst for knowledge about the world, the paranormal, and the arcane. However, this also makes him prone to breaking protocols and potentially exposing the Foundation's secrets to others.

The subject's fondness for sweets has been noted and he is known to offer candy to others as a way to establish rapport. While non-compliant behavior has been observed, it is not believed to be malicious or intentional but rather the result of his impulsive nature.

Despite his benign demeanor, subject 2630 is considered a high-risk individual due to his potential to leak sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. Examination of his internet activity reveals that he has previously interacted with entities and forums in the anomalous community. Further investigation is recommended to determine any possible links or influences from anomalous entities.

Addendum: On 05/██/20██, subject 2630 displayed anomalous abilities after unknowingly coming into contact with a cursed artifact. Sudden onset of pyrokinesis occurred, causing several injuries to personnel and extensive damages on-site. Subject was administered Class-C amnestics and artifact was successfully contained. Effects of the incident have since been reversed and subject is currently under strict supervision.
