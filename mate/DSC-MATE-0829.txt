Item #: SCP-829

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-829, known to the public as Dr. Simon Boucher, is to be monitored at all times while in Foundation custody. He is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Sector-12, and is to be granted access to a research library and a personal computer for recreational use. Any scholarly material provided to SCP-829 must be screened for anomalous properties before it is made available to him.

SCP-829 is allowed contact with other Foundation personnel so long as they have no reason to suspect his true nature. He is authorized to provide medical assistance to other humanoids within the facility under strict supervision. Interaction between SCP-829 and any SCP object is strictly forbidden under penalty of disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-829 appears to be a male human in his early 40s. He has a small black spot on his lips, a blue bandana around his head, and ski goggles for eyes. SCP-829's most prominent facial feature is his perpetual smile. He also has a jade earring and a red scarf that he keeps in his pocket. It is unknown whether these items have any anomalous properties.

SCP-829 is a skilled veterinarian and spends a significant amount of his free time reading and researching obscure topics. He has collected numerous books, documentaries, and other educational materials, and is eager to share his knowledge with anyone who will listen. Despite his friendly demeanor, SCP-829 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to compartmentalize his emotions and remain calm under pressure.

Addendum: SCP-829 was discovered in ███████, Canada, when a routine investigation uncovered anomalous readings in his veterinary clinic. Upon questioning, SCP-829 claimed ignorance of any anomalous activity and was fully cooperative during the initial containment procedure. Further investigation has revealed that SCP-829 may have inadvertently become a conduit of anomalous energy due to his extensive study of paranormal phenomena. Foundation researchers are currently working to confirm this hypothesis.
