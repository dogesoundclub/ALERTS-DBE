Item #: SCP-4308

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4308 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-4308's chamber is limited to Level 2 personnel and above. Under no circumstances are personnel to remove SCP-4308 from its chamber unless given explicit permission from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-4308 is a male human of indeterminate age, standing at roughly 1.7 meters tall and weighs approximately 66 kg. SCP-4308's most notable facial feature is a constantly frightened mouth, giving the impression of a perpetually nervous individual. SCP-4308 also wears nerd glasses and a green cross earring in both ears. Two gold chains are also present around SCP-4308's neck, one of which bears a small medallion of the Virgin Mary. SCP-4308 is almost always seen wearing a standard gas mask, regardless of its surroundings. Testing has determined that the mask serves no respirational or protective purpose.

SCP-4308 displays a strong sense of empathy and is often attuned to the emotions of others, sometimes to the point of expressing concern for the wellbeing of inanimate objects. SCP-4308's ability to soothe others' emotions has been noted, often resulting in humorous situations in which SCP-4308 accurately identifies the appropriate words to say to make someone feel better or helps others find humor in a difficult situation.

Addendum: SCP-4308 currently works as a fast food worker at [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], Canada. Its employer and coworkers all report a strangely calming and humorous aura about SCP-4308, although they cannot specifically identify any anomalous effects aside from a notable lack of hostility or aggression from customers. Further investigation into SCP-4308's past and origin is ongoing.
