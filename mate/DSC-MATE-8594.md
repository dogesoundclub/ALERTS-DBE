Item #: DSC-MATE-8594

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8594 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-8594 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Any communication with DSC-MATE-8594 must be conducted via video call, and all requests must be approved by a Level 3 or higher staff member.

Description: DSC-MATE-8594 is a female human of unknown age, identified as a fashion designer. Her main physical features consist of purple lips, normal glasses, and a retro cap on her head. DSC-MATE-8594 also has a two-color band on her forehead, gold earrings on her ears, and two accessories; a choker and an LED gas mask.

DSC-MATE-8594's personality is described as having a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, she also knows how to have fun, which can lead to humorous situations where she becomes the life of the party, and everyone dance or sings along to her favorite songs. DSC-MATE-8594 seems to have an innate ability to make those around her feel at ease, even those that are typically mistrusting or aggressive.

DSC-MATE-8594's anomalous properties manifest when she interacts with fabrics or materials, where she gains the ability to manipulate them to her will. DSC-MATE-8594's capabilities include the ability to alter the visual appearance and texture of fabrics, manipulate threads and fibers, and even create intricate designs that seemingly defy the laws of physics. However, overuse of her abilities causes DSC-MATE-8594 to become fatigued and could potentially result in anomalous events.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8594 was discovered after an incident at a Paris fashion show, in which witnesses reported fabrics and accessories had taken on a life of their own, disrupting the show and causing panic among the attendees. DSC agents were able to track the cause of the incident back to DSC-MATE-8594, and she was subsequently taken into Foundation custody for containment and further study.
