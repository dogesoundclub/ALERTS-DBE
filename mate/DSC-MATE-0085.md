Item #: DSC-MATE-85

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-85 is to be kept in a soundproof chamber with thick walls and a locked door. Its feeding schedule is in line with any common domesticated rabbit. The soundproof chamber has to be maintained weekly to avoid any damages due to DSC-MATE-85's energetic behavior. Any personnel in contact with DSC-MATE-85 requires a clearance level of 2.

Description: DSC-MATE-85 is identified as a male rabbit, equipped with the VR Jade LED eyes, a police cap on its head, a gold earring on one ear, and a gold chain. DSC-MATE-85 stands out compared to most rabbits due to its humanoid behavior, having enough intelligence to communicate with humans through a speech module on its collar. DSC-MATE-85's personality is that of a charismatic leader, always keen to be in charge of situations. It has remarkable political and interpersonal skills, which let him maneuver through conversations effortlessly.

DSC-MATE-85's abilities seem to be related to a genetic anomaly in its breeding lines, which has not been found in any other rabbits. The Foundation has a group tasked with finding the origins of DSC-MATE-85 and any information type about the DSC-MATE-85's species or similar anomalies. DSC-MATE-85's importance is because of its possible domestication for Foundation in any leadership-oriented projects.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-85 has been observed carrying copies of charismatic leader speeches and has been known to watch political debates on the television if left unmonitored. DSC-MATE-85 appears to have a particular interest in the democratic system, which may suggest that it used to be in contact with humans from that field of occupation. DSC-MATE-85 is not to be underestimated, and it has escaped once the soundproof chamber due to a security guard underestimating it. The security guard was given therapy sessions after the incident.
