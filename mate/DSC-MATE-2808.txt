Item #: 2808

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2808 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any requests they make for additional decoration or organization must be approved by a Level 3 or higher personnel. SCP-2808 must not be allowed access to any type of machinery or tools, as their anomalous effects can manifest in ways that could be hazardous to those around them.

Description: SCP-2808 is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on their face. They typically wear a retro cap and have red clown eyes. SCP-2808 displays a goggle on their forehead and a single jade earring on each ear. Their appearance, while attention-grabbing, is otherwise unremarkable.

SCP-2808's personality is defined by their obsessive attention to detail. They are often found organizing or obsessing over things not typically considered important, such as spice racks or closets. Their desire for perfectionism is not only concerning, but also appears to hold some extremely potent anomalous effects. It has been recorded in multiple accounts that objects SCP-2808 is paying attention to exhibit strange properties, breaking down, or completely rebuilding themselves. 

All personnel are strongly advised not to entrust SCP-2808 with machinery or tools, as these items tend to become a point of endless fascination and control. Any machinery or tools in possession of the SCP-2808 run the risk of behaving compulsively, falling into unpredictable mechanical patterns or skyrocketing in efficiency beyond predictability. 

SCP-2808 presents a pressing risk for any kind of foundation constructions, as their anomalous properties can put structures made by the SCP in danger of sudden unreliability, failure or uncontrollable modification. 

Approach SCP-2808 with extreme caution; unless it is with an unusually mundane request, accepting their demands and working with them may have potentially catastrophic effects.
