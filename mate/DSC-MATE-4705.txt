Item #: 4705

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4705 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit within Site-██. The containment unit must have a small selection of non-harmful supplements, fruit, and vegetables. The unit must also have a small selection of physical toys and puzzles. These are to be changed out every week to prevent Item 4705 from becoming bored or disinterested.

Description: Item 4705 is a male monkey that has undergone no known alterations or genetic mutations. It appears to be a Capuchin monkey with a height of roughly 85cm including its tail. Its fur is green, as if it hasn't been washed in a long time. It wears a set of normal glasses that do not appear to alter its vision. On its head, it has a mess of fur that has not been arranged as it hangs around in the fashion of an unkempt hairstyle. 

Item 4705 has a distinctive personality that suggests a deep curiosity about the world. It likes to learn about obscure and unusual topics, often randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others. This unusual behavior has led to some humorous situations. It has developed an addiction for candy sticks, and will often hold one in one hand while engaged in other activities.

Addendum: Item 4705 was first noticed when its owner, a local fashion designer, reported to the authorities that his monkey had developed unusual behaviour. Foundation Agents contained Item 4705, and amnesticized the owner. SCP-4705 was transported to Site-██, where Dr. S█████ noticed that sometimes when playing with foundation staff, Item 4705's fur would twitch unnaturally. Upon closer examination, it was found that there was evidence of hallucinogenic substances present in its fur. Further investigation is ongoing. 

Footnote: Tests are still being conducted to determine if SCP-4705 has any dangerous properties. Personnel are advised to treat Item 4705 with kindness and respect so as to avoid any unnecessary stress or anxiety.
