SCP Foundation file 6696:

Identification number 6696 refers to a human female who works as a simple fast food worker. Do not let their mundane occupation fool you, as this individual possesses a unique feature that sets them apart from others of their species. Their piercing blue clown eyes can hypnotize any unsuspecting subject that meets their gaze.  It is recommended to avoid prolonged direct eye contact with 6696 to prevent falling under their influence.

In addition to their hypnotic stare, 6696 is also known to wear a tiara on their head and green cross earrings in their ears. This jewelry is suspected to possess minor anomalous properties, although the exact extent of these abilities remains unknown.

6696's most distinguishing physical feature is the medical mask they wear over their mouth.  This masks their disarming and soothing voice, leading many to believe it conceals an underlying danger. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

In terms of personality, 6696 is a meticulous and perceptive individual. They possess the keen ability to pay great attention to detail which can make them an excellent gift giver. However, their desire to give the perfect present can lead to a significant amount of internal agonizing while deciding on the right gift. This could be linked with their hypnotic abilities, as they may strive to have other's approval.

It is recommended that this subject is viewed cautiously and avoided if possible. If apprehended, 6696 should be monitored closely at all times to prevent the use of their anomalous properties.
