Item #: 2940

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2940, identified as a male humanoid tiger, must be kept in a secure location at all times. Personnel are advised to exercise caution, as 2940 is prone to sudden bursts of spontaneous behavior, including impulsive actions that could endanger themselves and others. A lit cigarette must be provided at all times to keep the subject calm.

Description: 2940 is a rare instance of an anomalous species of humanoid tiger, possessing the physical traits of a Siberian Tiger. The subject's most distinct attribute is the pair of blood-red clown eyes, which stare out from beneath a bucket hat. The tiger's frightened mouth adds to the unnerving appearance of the subject.

Further examination has revealed the presence of a jade earring in each of the tiger's ears. Though the source of this addition is unknown, it is speculated that it may have been a form of adornment before the subject became anomalous.

Personality: As with most anomalous entities, 2940's mental state is difficult to predict. However, it has been observed that the subject tends to behave in a spontaneous and often reckless fashion. Subject 2940 has been known to engage in dangerous activities on a whim, leading to humorous situations such as leaping off cliffs into bodies of water.

Furthermore, the subject is noted to have an affinity towards smoking, with a lit cigarette being a potent tool in keeping the subject calm during containment.

Additional Notes: Little is known about the origin or purpose of subject 2940's creation, and research into its abilities is ongoing. Personnel are advised to maintain constant surveillance and document any unusual behavior or alterations to its appearance. Request for further research into 2940's anomalous capabilities is pending approval.
