Item #: SCP-7225

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7225 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-7225 is to be restricted to Level 2 personnel with the Managerial Security clearance. SCP-7225 is to be provided with medical masks and red scarves to wear at all times. Any requests made by SCP-7225 that do not directly conflict with containment procedures may be considered at site manager discretion.

Description: SCP-7225 is a male human identified by the Foundation as a car salesman. SCP-7225 exhibits two identifiable anomalies: one large mouth spot situated over the right side of the mouth and a two-color band on the forehead. SCP-7225 always carries and wears a medical mask over the lower half of his face and a red scarf around his neck. SCP-7225's personality is characterized as rebellious, frequently choosing to break or bend rules for amusement.

SCP-7225's anomalous properties appear to lack any dangerous effects on its surroundings, and its containment appears to be successful. However, due to SCP-7225's potential to cause conflict, it is recommended that SCP-7225 be kept under observation.

Addendum 7225-A: On ██/██/20██, SCP-7225 was discovered after several reports were filed about a car salesman who had displayed a unique appearance and caused disturbances in a car dealership. MTF Omicron-7 ("Funtime") was dispatched and brought SCP-7225 under Foundation custody without incident.

Addendum 7225-B: During initial interviews with SCP-7225, it expressed a fascination with bending rules and getting away with it. SCP-7225 has not indicated any knowledge about its anomalous abilities, nor has it demonstrated any inclination to use them for any particular purpose. SCP-7225 has been noted as cooperative with Foundation personnel, and has been observed to share stories with genuinely humorous content during interviews.
