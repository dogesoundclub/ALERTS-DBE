Item #: 9815

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9815 is to be housed in a standard animal containment chamber at Site-███. Staff are advised not to underestimate SCP-9815 and to refrain from making any unnecessary actions that may cause it any stress or harm. SCP-9815 is to be provided with a balanced vegetarian diet, as well as occasional treats, to maintain its good health. In addition, SCP-9815 must be allowed to work as a veterinarian for a designated animal ward within Site-███.

Description: SCP-9815 appears to be a male, anthropomorphic rabbit of average height and build. It is often seen wearing a red beanie on its head, a gold chain around its neck, as well as an earring on one of its ears. SCP-9815 also carries a candy stick, which it is often seen munching on. SCP-9815 displays an affable and approachable demeanor, often chatting with anyone who would listen.

SCP-9815 is known for its extraordinary caregiving skills, which extends not only to animals, but to various other objects as well. SCP-9815 has been observed giving names to various items in its possession, such as its car or household appliances, and appearing to talk to these items on occasion. It is noted that SCP-9815’s interaction with its surroundings may provide an unexplained boost in energy and well-being to the items in question.

Personnel have also observed instances of SCP-9815 comforting other SCPs that display more volatile behavior, such as SCP-████ and SCP-████, as if trying to soothe them. However, due to the potentially hazardous nature of these SCPs, personnel are advised not to put SCP-9815 in direct contact with them unless strictly necessary.

SCP-9815’s effects on items and creatures it interacts with may warrant further study into potential anomalous properties. However, its unobtrusive presence within Site-███ is deemed beneficial, and its employment as a veterinarian at the designated animal ward continues to be approved by on-site supervisors.
