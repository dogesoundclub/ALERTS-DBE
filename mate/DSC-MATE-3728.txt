Item #: SCP-3728

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3728 is to be kept in a specially designed chamber consisting of a small office space and a meditation area, separated by a soundproof wall. SCP-3728 is permitted access to limited internet and reading materials, but is to be monitored at all times. Any attempts to communicate with SCP-3728 must be cleared by Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-3728 appears to be a human female, approximately 32 years old with orange eyebrow eyes and a bucket hat on her head. SCP-3728 has a pair of goggles attached to her forehead and a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-3728 is often seen wearing a silver chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-3728's personality is highly introspective, leading to extended periods of daydreaming and absent-mindedness. SCP-3728 has been observed tripping over objects and walking into walls while lost in thought. SCP-3728's abilities and reasoning skills are not affected by her introspection, evidenced by her occupation as a lawyer.

SCP-3728's true nature is not yet fully understood, as her introspective nature often makes her uncooperative in conversations. SCP-3728 frequently makes references to "other worlds" and "new dimensions," but refuses to elaborate on what they mean. Further study is necessary to determine if SCP-3728 poses a threat to Foundation security.
