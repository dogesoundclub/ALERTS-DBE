SCP-7258, also known as the "Fast Food Witch," is a female human possessing extraordinary leadership abilities. Her bright smile and witch short hairstyle are complemented by the goggles she always wears atop her forehead, which allow her to see things others cannot. SCP-7258 has a distinguishing feature of a red cross earring on both of her ears and often wears a silver chain around her neck.

As a fast food worker, SCP-7258 can be found in various food chains manipulating those around her to follow her commands. Her natural charisma and commanding presence make her an effective leader, and she has frequently been observed taking charge of various situations, both in her professional and personal life.

While SCP-7258's abilities are highly desirable among many organizations, they also pose a potential breach risk. SCP-7258 is currently kept under surveillance, and all her movements are closely monitored by the Foundation.

Any attempts to approach or establish contact with SCP-7258 should be done with extreme caution, as she represents a significant danger to Foundation security protocols.
