Description: DSC-MATE-6998 was a human with orange eyebrows which were speculated to be contacts or some anomalous feature. The subject was a female mechanic in her mid-20s headquartered in an undisclosed location. She had green hair covered under a purple cap with a goggle on her forehead. The subject's personality was unpredictable and spontaneous, showing a tendency to take risks without considering the consequences. It was believed that she may have been under the influence of some anomalous effect, leading to her impulsive behavior.

DSC-MATE-6998 had a habit of performing dangerous stunts like cliff diving or riding on the edge of high-rise buildings. She seemed to enjoy the thrill of living on the edge, and her recklessness had led to several near-death experiences. Despite this, there were no apparent physical or psychological abnormalities observed in her.

However, after a persistent investigation by Foundation agents, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-6998 did not possess any true anomalous abilities. Instead, her spontaneous and unpredictable nature was attributed to her own free will.

DSC-MATE-6998 was approached by Foundation agents and offered the choice to continue living her life, so long as she agreed to avoid dangerous stunts and activities that could cause harm to herself or others. After their encounter, DSC-MATE-6998 ceased performing dangerous stunts and was observed to have returned to a more normal life.

Following the Foundation's policy, DSC-MATE-6998 is now considered neutralized and is no longer a threat to the DogeSoundClub or the general public.
