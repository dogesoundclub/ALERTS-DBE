Item #: 8261

Object Class: Safe

Job Description: Ms. 8261 is employed as a beautician at a local salon.

Description: Ms. 8261 is a human female with distinctive facial features. She has several spots on her forehead and a purple tinted lip, which may indicate the use of unconventional beauty treatments. She wears normal glasses on her eyes and a red cross earring on her right ear. Ms. 8261 often carries a cigarette with her when she is outdoors. 

Personality: Despite her seemingly mundane job as a beautician, Ms. 8261 exhibits a strong sense of independence and determination. She rarely asks for help, even in situations where it would be in her best interest. This stubbornness can result in some comical mishaps, such as trying to move heavy furniture by herself or refusing to use a map when she is lost. 

Special Containment Procedures: Ms. 8261 poses no threat to the general public or Foundation staff. She is to be monitored periodically to ensure that her stubbornness does not put her in harm's way. If she is encountered in a potentially dangerous situation, Foundation personnel are permitted to offer assistance but should do so delicately to avoid offending her sense of independence. 

Note: Ms. 8261's unconventional beauty techniques, coupled with her unique appearance, may indicate that she possesses knowledge of unconventional alchemy. The Foundation should keep a close eye on her activities and report any suspicious behavior immediately.
