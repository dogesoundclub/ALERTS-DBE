Item #: SCP-5326

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5326 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls, floors, and ceilings, and three levels of acoustic insulation. The chamber must be equipped with infrared and motion sensors, as well as a soundproof intercom system for communicating with SCP-5326.

Description: SCP-5326 is a male Bengal tiger that displays several unusual physical traits, including Jade LED eyes that emit a virtual reality effect, a blue bandana wrapped around its head, and a goggle on its forehead. SCP-5326 also sports a jade earring on its left ear, a silver chain worn around its neck, and a whistle hanging from its bandana.

SCP-5326 has demonstrated an uncanny ability to predict events before they happen or sense when someone is feeling upset or anxious. While this power may seem impressive, it can also be eerie, and many people may find SCP-5326's psychic abilities unnerving.

SCP-5326 works as a banker, and its abilities have helped it achieve a high level of success in its career. However, its abilities have also raised concerns about its true motivations and whether it may be using its powers for personal gain.

SCP-5326's containment is of utmost importance due to the potential risks it poses to the public's safety, and a strict protocol must be followed when interacting with it. Any personnel assigned to SCP-5326's containment must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation before being allowed access.
