Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5281 should report to its assigned location daily and perform its duties as a traffic officer.

Description: DSC-MATE-5281 is a human female with unusual physical features. The subject's face is marked with orange stripes, and its eyes resemble those of a clown, with a blue coloration and an expanded iris. The subject's head is adorned with a single wing, and its ears are pierced with golden earrings. DSC-MATE-5281 is usually seen wearing a medical mask over its mouth and a silver chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-5281 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence and individuality, evident in its reluctance to ask for help, even in situations where assistance would be necessary. This trait has led to humorous situations, such as DSC-MATE-5281 attempting to move heavy objects by itself or deliberately getting lost without using a map. DSC-MATE-5281's personality has been shown to be resistant to manipulation or coercion, making it a problematic subject for longer-term containment.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-5281's striking appearance and unusual abilities, it has been suggested that the subject be interviewed for potential use as an agent for the Foundation. However, given DSC-MATE-5281's tendency towards independence, any such decision should be made with caution.
