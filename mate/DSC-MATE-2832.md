Description: 2832 is a tiger of unknown age and origin, presenting itself as a fast food worker. The subject appears average in size and build for a tiger, with no distinguishing physical characteristics except for a pair of jade earrings and a silver chain around its wrist. The subject seems to be in perfect health despite its captivity.

2832 possesses a variety of unusual traits, including an inexplicable goggle on its forehead that has proven impervious to removal, and an apparent fondness for smoking cigarettes. The subject is highly organized and efficient, often taking control of group projects and delegating tasks with a commanding yet matter-of-fact approach.

Most unusually, 2832 displays an unwavering calmness and self-control that belies its animal nature, even when facing dire circumstances. It seems to have a fascination with human culture and frequently exhibits traits of bipedal locomotion, walking upright like a human.

Addendum: 2832 is a highly intelligent and formidable entity, not to be underestimated. It is recommended that all personnel maintain a healthy distance from the subject and refrain from any unnecessary interactions. Any breach in security could result in deadly consequences.
