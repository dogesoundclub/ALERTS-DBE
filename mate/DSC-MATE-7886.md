Item #: 7886

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7886 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. The subject is allowed to continue their job as a fast food worker, but is required to wear their normal gas mask at all times in public. Any attempts made by the subject to remove their gas mask are to be met with immediate sedation and containment. Interaction with the subject should be kept to a minimum except for testing purposes.

Description: Subject 7886 appears to be a female human of average height and build, with defining facial features such as orange stripes layered on top of a smile and bright red clown eyes. The subject's head is adorned with 90s brown hair and they have a goggle on their forehead. Jade earrings adorn their ears. Visible at all times is a normal gas mask which they wear on their face.

Subject 7886 displays a highly analytical and logical thought process. However, they also possess a quirky sense of humor, often making witty observations and teasing others in a dry and deadpan way. This behavior is believed to be a coping mechanism for their containment.

Testing on the subject has revealed no anomalous powers or abilities, but extreme caution should still be taken in their presence.

Addendum: It should be noted that subject 7886 possesses a significant level of general knowledge, especially in the area of urban legends and myths within modern society. Further testing may be necessary with this knowledge in mind.
