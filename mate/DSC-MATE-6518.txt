Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6518 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no access to electronic devices or communication tools. Any interactions with SCP-6518 should be conducted through a specialized communication interface. Access to SCP-6518 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-6518 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, with a frightened mouth as a prominent face feature covered in a purple cap with a headset. Their forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles as well as a jade earring. SCP-6518 has displayed an addiction to cigarettes despite obvious physical discomfort.

SCP-6518 displays remarkable charisma and natural charm that makes them the life of the party, which has resulted in several anomalous events. SCP-6518 has been known to tell jokes and perform silly dances, which have had powerful effects on those around them, causing them to unwittingly perform similar actions. Due to this trait and their addiction, SCP-6518 has been deemed a potential security risk.

Addendum: Incident Report 6518-A 
On ██/██/20██, SCP-6518 initiated a party in their containment chamber with several D-class personnel. Security footage shows that SCP-6518 used their natural charm to persuade D-class personnel to join in a "smoke break." Shortly after the event began, several D-class personnel began exhibiting strange behavior and repeating SCP-6518's phrases and mannerisms. This event required amnestic treatment for all witnesses involved. SCP-6518's request to hold future parties has been denied.
