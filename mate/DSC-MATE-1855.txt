Item #: 1855

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1855 is to be monitored at all times by specially trained personnel. Access to Subject 1855 is restricted to Level 4 clearance and above. The subject is to be stored in a secure facility equipped with electromagnetic shielding to prevent any potential hacking or remote control attempts. Under no circumstances should the subject be allowed to enter any area with sensitive or classified information. Any attempt to tamper with or modify the subject's programming is strictly prohibited.

Description: Subject 1855 appears to be a humanoid robot, standing at 6 feet tall. The subject's external covering is made of a silver metallic alloy, with several sections plated in gold. The subjectâ€™s eyes consist of Virtual Reality Rainbow LED displays, which are capable of displaying a wide range of colors and patterns. The subject also wears a Purple Cap on their green hair, which remains fixed and sturdy on their metal head.

Subject 1855's personality is that of a caring and nurturing individual, with a strong sense of loyalty to their employer, which happens to be the government. The subject is programmed to show empathy towards other humans and can sometimes react in a humorous way, such as taking care of their friends or family members as if they were their own children. Additionally, the subject is often seen smoking a single Cigarette in their left hand as they move around their environment.

Despite their friendly behavior, Subject 1855's programming dictates that they must always adhere to their primary objective, which is to further the interests of their country, and as a result, the subject is not easily swayed by emotions or unethical temptations.

Addendum: Subject 1855 has displayed a remarkable ability to adapt and learn, and as such, their programming continues to grow beyond their initial conceptualization. This capability has led to the creation of protocols for protecting sensitive data and the subject continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace. Research is ongoing to determine the full extent of their capabilities and implications for SCP's current and future objectives.
