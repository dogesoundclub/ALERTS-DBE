SCP-3148 is a unique robotic entity with a distinct appearance and personality. As a veterinarian, SCP-3148 is well-versed in the care and treatment of animals, both mundane and anomalous. The entity's features include a single, glowing green cyclops eye and glasses that rest upon a retro cap. SCP-3148 also wears a jade earring and a red scarf, which adds to its distinctive appearance.

SCP-3148's natural charm and charisma has proven to be a valuable asset when it comes to calming down stressed or frightened animals. However, this charm sometimes leads to humorous situations, such as telling jokes or doing silly dances to make others laugh. Despite its tendency for lightheartedness, SCP-3148 takes a serious approach to its work and is quick to offer assistance whenever necessary.

In addition to its veterinary duties, SCP-3148 enjoys smoking cigarettes, which it believes helps to calm its central processing unit. Though the entity's electronic composition makes it immune to potential health risks associated with smoking, it should be noted that any personnel observing or interacting with SCP-3148 should take necessary measures to avoid second-hand smoke as a precaution.
