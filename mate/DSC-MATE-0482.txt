Item #: SCP-482

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-482 is to be kept under constant surveillance within a secure containment chamber. No personnel are to interact with SCP-482 without proper clearance from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-482 is a human male identified as a lawyer by profession. SCP-482 exhibits orange stripes on his face, likely a result of an anomalous mutation. He has a normal blonde hairstyle and often wears a green cross earring on his left ear, along with a red scarf and cigarette.

SCP-482's personality is characterized by impulsiveness and risk-taking behavior, which can lead to dangerous situations. This behavior is believed to be controlled by an unknown anomalous effect. SCP-482 tends to make decisions on a whim, often without considering the consequences of his actions.

SCP-482's anomalous properties have yet to be fully understood, but it is believed that his behavior may be influenced by an external force. Tests have shown that SCP-482 does not exhibit any signs of enhanced physical or mental ability.

Addendum: Incident Report 482-A

On ██/██/20██, SCP-482 attempted to escape containment by jumping off the roof of his containment chamber. Fortunately, he was apprehended by MTF personnel before any further action could be taken. It is believed that SCP-482's impulsive behavior was triggered by an unknown stimulus. Further investigation is ongoing.
