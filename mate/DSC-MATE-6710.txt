Item #: 6710

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 6710 is currently held in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. Due to her unique appearance, visitors are only granted access with prior approval from at least one Level 3 staff member. Access to any of her accessories, including her LED Gas Mask and Choker, is strictly prohibited without proper authorization. Dr. 6710 is to be monitored at all times for any unexpected behavior or changes to her abilities.

Description: Dr. 6710 is a female human with distinct orange stripes on her face and a set of blue clown eyes that seem to stare through observers. Her red lips are perpetually pursed in amusement, often betraying her expressionless face. She has dual pigtail hairdos and wears two-color bands on her forehead, as well as goggles on her forehead. Dr. 6710 also wears a choker and an LED gas mask that glows softly in the dark.

Despite her humorous appearance, Dr. 6710's behavior is often unpredictable, and it is unclear if this is a product of her personality or supernatural abilities. She has a dry sense of humor that can often catch people off guard, and her deadpan jokes can be surprisingly funny. However, it is rumored that her humor is a coping mechanism, and that she harbors darker tendencies that can surface unexpectedly.

Dr. 6710 has demonstrated a remarkable understanding of anatomy and physiology, leading researchers to believe that she possesses advanced medical knowledge. She frequently asks about medical procedures, suggesting that she has a deep fascination with the human body. It is uncertain how she acquired this knowledge, and what role it may play in her abilities or motives.

Addendum: Dr. 6710 has been noted to display a unique ability to heal injuries and ailments. While her methodology is currently under investigation, preliminary results indicate that she has the power to manipulate cellular regeneration, which suggests that she may possess a form of advanced healing magic. Further observation is required to determine the full extent of her abilities, and whether they pose any potential danger to Foundation personnel.
