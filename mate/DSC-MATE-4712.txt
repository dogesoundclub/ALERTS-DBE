Description: SCP-4712 is a humanoid entity that manifests as a human male wearing a purple cap with a headset, a red scarf, and red clown eyes.

Its behavior can be unpredictable and can range from compliant to aggressive. SCP-4712 has a tendency to sneak out of confinement and may take unauthorized absences from work.

SCP-4712 has a particular affinity for cigarettes, which it claims to be an essential component of its creative process. SCP-4712's inventory is entirely composed of various types and brands of cigarettes, and it frequently uses them as bargaining chips in exchanges with other entities.

SCP-4712â€™s anomalous properties are related to its ability to manipulate the emotions and behaviors of those around it. It can induce hallucinations, including visions of clothing designs or images of people wearing its creations.

Addendum 4712-A: Incident 4712-Alpha
SCP-4712 managed to breach containment and was found outside the site in a neighborhood populated by fashion students. The entity, influenced by the students around it, began to create new designs, releasing them to the area's population. Site personnel arriving at the scene observed a marked increase in fashion-consciousness within the population, with corresponding effects on the mental stability of personnel. SCP-4712 was eventually retrieved and returned to confinement.
