Item #: SCP-5502

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5502 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-5502 is allowed access to a computer with internet connectivity for work-related purposes only. Smoking is prohibited within Site-██, and SCP-5502's request for a designated smoking area has been denied.

Description: SCP-5502 is a human female of average height and weight. The subject sports distinctive orange stripes across their nose and cheeks, as well as red lipstick. SCP-5502 also wears a pair of goggles on their forehead and a jade earring in each ear. 

SCP-5502 exhibits tendencies towards caretaking and nurturing, often treating friends and family as if they were her own children. This has led to humorous situations where SCP-5502 has been observed to fuss over and coddle individuals who are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. 

One notable behavior of SCP-5502 is their frequent use of cigarettes as a stress-relief aid. Despite being denied a designated smoking area, SCP-5502 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to conceal their smoking from on-duty personnel.

Addendum: SCP-5502's programming abilities have been utilized in several Foundation projects, resulting in increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. SCP-5502 expressed interest in working on projects related to the containment and study of anomalous objects, and this request is pending further review.
