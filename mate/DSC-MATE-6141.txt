Item #: SCP-6141

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6141 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Any electrical equipment within the containment cell must be inspected and maintained regularly. SCP-6141 is not to be given materials that could be used to tamper with electrical equipment.

Description: SCP-6141 is a human male of average height and build, with blue clown eyes and a constant smile. SCP-6141 wears a blue bandana and a gas mask, which it claims is necessary due to its job as an electrician. A pair of goggles are often seen resting on its forehead. SCP-6141 also wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-6141 has an innate ability to connect with others on a deep emotional level, often leading to humorous situations. It possesses extreme charisma, and is known to get strangers to open up about their life stories or share funny anecdotes that bring people closer together. SCP-6141's personality is friendly and outgoing, leading many Foundation personnel to let their guard down around it.

SCP-6141's anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with electrical equipment. It has the ability to manipulate electricity in ways not traditionally possible, allowing it to complete electrical tasks quickly and efficiently. SCP-6141 has also demonstrated the ability to short-circuit electrical equipment in order to cause harm to individuals or groups of people. As such, extreme caution must be taken when working with SCP-6141.

Addendum: SCP-6141 has expressed interest in assisting the Foundation with its electrical needs, and has shown a willingness to cooperate. However, given its unpredictability, it has been deemed too dangerous for use in Foundation operations. SCP-6141's containment is to remain unchanged until further notice.
