Item #: SCP-5892

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5892 is to be kept in a standard animal containment chamber in Site-██. SCP-5892 is allowed two hours of outdoor time per day, under the supervision of at least one Level 3 personnel. During this time, SCP-5892 is prohibited from contacting any non-foundation entities. SCP-5892's gas mask and earring are to be secured at all times when not in use, and any requests for their use are to be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-5892 is a male tiger of average size and appearance, with the exception of its eyes, which resemble those of a clown. SCP-5892 wears a bucket hat with a two-color band and a red cross earring. In addition, SCP-5892 carries a normal gas mask as an accessory.

SCP-5892 possesses human-level intelligence and is capable of speech. SCP-5892's most notable trait is its scatterbrained nature, often getting sidetracked or forgetting important details. This can result in humorous situations, but also poses a potential security risk.

SCP-5892's gas mask and earring possess anomalous properties, which have yet to be fully understood. Testing has revealed that SCP-5892's earring allows it to communicate with other anomalous entities, while its gas mask provides protection from certain types of anomalous phenomena. However, these items also appear to exacerbate SCP-5892's scatterbrained tendencies.

Addendum: During a routine psychological evaluation, SCP-5892 expressed a desire to pursue a career as a beautician. After approval from Site-██'s director, SCP-5892 has been trained and granted permission to provide beauty services to foundation personnel as a form of stress relief. However, all appointments are subject to approval by at least two Level 4 personnel, and SCP-5892's gas mask and earring must be secured during all sessions.
