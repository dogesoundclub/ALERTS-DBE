Item #: SCP-8263

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8263 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with a 2 meter wall reinforced with steel to prevent escape. SCP-8263 has been given permission to continue working as a theater manager with specific guidelines and regular check-ins to ensure compliance. SCP-8263 is not to have any contact with non-Foundation personnel without prior approval from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-8263 is a human male with spots on his face and a constant smile. SCP-8263's eyes are red clown eyes and his head is not arranged in a typical human fashion. SCP-8263 has a two-color band on his forehead and is always seen wearing a medical mask, a red scarf, and a jade earring. Despite the strange appearance, SCP-8263 is not visibly anomalous.

SCP-8263 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This often leads to situations where SCP-8263 tells funny stories or does silly impersonations to lighten the mood. SCP-8263's personality can be disarming, making it difficult for others to maintain professional boundaries. As a result, SCP-8263 has been provided with training on how to interact with others in a professional setting.

SCP-8263's job as a theater manager has allowed him to make connections within the entertainment industry and to keep abreast of any potential paranormal activity. SCP-8263 has been instructed to report any suspected paranormal activity to his Foundation handler.

Addendum: SCP-8263 has been deemed a valuable asset to the Foundation due to his ability to gather information and make contacts within the entertainment industry. Additionally, SCP-8263's disarming personality can be used in social engineering and information gathering operations. As such, it has been recommended that SCP-8263 be granted more leeway in his job duties.
