SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6744 is to be kept in a secure enclosure at Site-██, with a natural forest-like environment for it to climb and interact with its surroundings. Personnel assigned to SCP-6744 must wear protective gear when entering its enclosure, as SCP-6744 may become agitated and display aggressive behavior towards unfamiliar individuals.

Description: SCP-6744 is a male monkey of the ██████ species, measuring approximately 0.75 meters in height and weighing 25 kilograms. It displays human-like cognitive abilities, including the ability to communicate through sign language and problem-solving skills. SCP-6744 is commonly seen wearing a Doge hat and a gold earring on its left ear. It also carries a candy stick as an accessory, which it uses to amuse itself by balancing it on its nose.

SCP-6744's personality is described as being highly organized, consistently planning its daily activities in advance. However, SCP-6744 also displays a spontaneous side, often surprising its friends and colleagues with impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning, which are typically well-received. It seems to enjoy socializing and often shares its candy stick with others, displaying a kind and generous disposition.

SCP-6744's abilities and behavior suggest it may have been subjected to anomalous manipulation, although its origins remain unknown. Further research and observation are necessary to determine the full extent of SCP-6744's properties and possible containment methods.

Addendum: SCP-6744 has shown an interest in selling and promoting real estate properties to other SCP entities. Efforts to discourage this behavior have proven unsuccessful, as SCP-6744 continues to find creative ways to promote properties to other SCPs. This behavior is currently under investigation.
