SCP-1440's personality is characterized by a deep curiosity about the world, and it enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. This curiosity leads to some humorous situations, such as randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others.

SCP-1440 has been observed to have mild telepathic abilities, allowing it to read surface thoughts of individuals within a 10-meter radius. This ability has proven useful in its profession, as it can suggest personalized treatments and procedures based on the client's preferences.

Addendum: SCP-1440 has requested access to SCP-████, an anomalous foundation that specializes in hair growth and modification, for "professional development purposes." The request is currently under review by the containment team.
