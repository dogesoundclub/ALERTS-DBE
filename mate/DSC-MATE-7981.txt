Item #: SCP-7981

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7981 is to be monitored at all times using surveillance cameras and patrolling guards. The subject is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, and any visitors are to be screened prior to contact. The use of electronic devices within 10 meters of SCP-7981 is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-7981 is a female-humanoid politician with multiple strange physical features. The subject possesses red clown eyes, and her skin is covered with a pattern of spots. SCP-7981 wears a red cross earring and a choker at all times, which appear to be some form of Talismanic objects. Additionally, SCP-7981 wears a gas mask on occasion, claiming that it helps her breathe easier under certain air conditions.

Despite her strange physical attributes, SCP-7981 maintains a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, though she can be fiercely protective of her loved ones. This trait often leads to humorous situations, as she engages in heated arguments or conflicts with those who insult or threaten her friends and family members. It is not advisable to provoke SCP-7981 in any way, as she has been observed to become highly agitated and dangerous under such circumstances.

Addendum: SCP-7981's Talismanic objects and red clown eyes have been found to possess anomalous properties. Further research is required to understand the full extent of these properties and their effects on SCP-7981.
