Item #: SCP-1741

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-1741 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with enhanced security measures to prevent any potential escape attempts. Guards are to be stationed around the clock to observe SCP-1741's behavior and prevent any unusual activity. SCP-1741 is not to be given any form of communication with the outside world, and all requests for special accommodations must be approved by the Site Director.

Description:

SCP-1741 is a male monkey that stands approximately 4 feet tall. It wears a doge hat on its head and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, it wears a red scarf around its neck and a normal gas mask over its face. SCP-1741 speaks fluent English and has demonstrated exceptional organizational and leadership skills. It identifies as a Mafia Boss and holds a commanding presence among its subordinates.

SCP-1741's personality is characterized by its high level of organization and efficiency. It often comes across as controlling, leading to humorous situations where it takes charge of group projects or events and assigns tasks to others. Additionally, SCP-1741 has shown a willingness to demand loyalty and obedience from those around it, using intimidation tactics to enforce its will.

Addendum:

SCP-1741 was first contained on ██/██/20██ after it was observed leading a group of subordinates in violent criminal activity. Despite its small size, SCP-1741 was able to command a significant amount of respect and fear among its associates, making it a formidable presence within the criminal underworld. SCP-1741's containment presents a significant challenge, as its intelligence and resourcefulness make it a constant threat to security.
