Item #: SCP-7990

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7990 is to be monitored during work hours and is not to be allowed unsupervised access to any train or locomotive. Any deviation from standard daily routines must be immediately reported to the Site Supervisor. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 (AKA "City Slickers") is to be dispatched to locate and apprehend SCP-7990.

Description: SCP-7990 is a male human of average height and build. SCP-7990's face features a prominent smile which is always present regardless of any emotional state. SCP-7990's eyes are obscured by ski goggles and wears a police cap. SCP-7990 has a jade earring in his left ear and is often seen wearing an LED gas mask.

SCP-7990 exhibits a high level of emotional empathy and compassion but has demonstrated on occasion, to take on other people's problems as his own. SCP-7990 feels a sense of responsibility to try and fix everything and everyone around him, which can lead to exhaustion and burnout.

SCP-7990 is employed as a train driver and has exhibited the ability to manipulate his surroundings through unrevealed means. Observations indicate that he has caused crashes and/or derailed trains in the past, but SCP-7990 has remained unharmed during these events.

SCP-7990's full capabilities are unknown at this time, and any attempts at further research require approval from the Site Director.

Addendum: SCP-7990 has been observed engaging in seemingly random acts of kindness towards civilians, often going beyond what is required or expected of him. It is advised to restrict contact with SCP-7990 as much as possible due to his anomalous behavior and possible ability to influence the emotions and actions of others.
