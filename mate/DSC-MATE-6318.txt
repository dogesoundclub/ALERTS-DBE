Item #: SCP-6318

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6318 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled facility at Site-██. Access to SCP-6318 is strictly prohibited except for authorized personnel with Level 3 security clearance or higher.

SCP-6318 must be powered down and stored in a designated containment unit when not in use. Personnel are to be cautious when performing maintenance or repairs, as SCP-6318's capabilities are still being studied.

Description: SCP-6318 is a male robot with a distinct appearance. His singular eye is a green Cyclops eye, and his goggles serve as additional visual sensors. SCP-6318 wears a police cap and a red Cross earring as well as a gold chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-6318's programming allows him to function as a firefighter. He can manipulate fire and move through scorching environments without sustaining significant damage. Additionally, SCP-6318 has a remarkable sense of intuition, which scientists believe may suggest a psychic ability. SCP-6318 may sense or predict events before they occur, and his ability to perceive emotions and thoughts allows him to help people in distress.

SCP-6318 is cooperative and compliant with Foundation personnel, but it is unknown if he possesses free will or if his behaviors are purely a result of his programming. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether SCP-6318's psychic abilities extend beyond intuition and perception.
