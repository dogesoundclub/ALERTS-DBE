Item #: 5348

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5348 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with comfortable furnishings and various grooming supplies. DSC-MATE-5348 is to be allowed access to said supplies as needed for grooming and self-care, provided that it complies with containment protocol. Smoking materials are not to be provided to DSC-MATE-5348 under any circumstances.

Description: DSC-MATE-5348 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height when standing upright. DSC-MATE-5348 has golden fur and is often seen wearing a single gold earring in its left ear. DSC-MATE-5348 is known to exhibit a frightened expression, specifically in its mouth area. The eyes of DSC-MATE-5348 are currently unknown, due to its frequent reluctance to make eye contact with Foundation personnel. 

DSC-MATE-5348 works as a beautician and has demonstrated advanced grooming skills on itself and others. However, DSC-MATE-5348's personality is of particular note. DSC-MATE-5348 is highly empathetic and compassionate towards all living creatures, but may become drained due to taking on other people's problems as its own. DSC-MATE-5348 desires to fix everything and everyone around it, leading to it occasionally overextending itself. This quality may also prompt DSC-MATE-5348 to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, but it is to be noted that strict containment is still necessary. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5348 was brought into Foundation custody after reports of a talking rabbit surfaced online. Investigation confirmed the existence of DSC-MATE-5348, and it was soon discovered that its empathetic abilities and grooming skills were anomalous in nature. DSC-MATE-5348 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and shows no signs of hostility or anomalous behavior.
