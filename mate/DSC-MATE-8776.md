Item #: 8776

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8776 is not to be contained at this time, as they pose no immediate threat to public safety. However, their continued monitoring is advised, as sudden power outages and electrical anomalies in their vicinity have been reported on occasion. 

Description: Subject 8776 is a male human who works as an electrician for a local power company. They have green hair styled in a messy fashion and wears a purple cap on their head. A red victory band can be seen on their forehead, accompanied by a silver chain as their main accessory. Their most notable feature, however, is the constant smile on their face. 

Subject 8776 wears normal glasses and a gas mask as their secondary accessory, which is customary for most electricians to protect themselves from electric shocks and other dangers on the job. However, the gas mask is also theorized to serve a secondary purpose, possibly related to their anomalous behavior. 

Personality: Subject 8776 is known to possess exceptional analytical and logical capabilities, making them an excellent debater and arguer. They enjoy debating on various trivial topics, which can lead to some rather amusing situations. It is advised that you do not engage in any debates with them unless you are prepared to lose. 

Further testing is required to determine the full extent of Subject 8776's anomalous abilities and the reason behind their constant smile and gas mask usage. Until further notice, Subject 8776 is to be monitored at all times for any anomalous behavior or sudden outages in their vicinity.
