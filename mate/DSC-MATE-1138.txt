Item #: SCP-1138

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1138 is to be monitored and tracked through standard means of surveillance. SCP-1138 is to be approached with caution and treated with respect due to her tendency to attract attention. SCP-1138 is allowed to continue her job as a delivery driver for cover purposes.

Description: SCP-1138 is a human female of average height and weight. She has red clown eyes and a distinctive purple lip, which she accentuates with purple lipstick. SCP-1138 has green hair with a purple cap and wears a red cross earring in her ears. She often carries a cigarette with her at all times.

SCP-1138 is very outgoing and loves to be the center of attention, often engaging in storytelling or jokes that can leave others laughing uncontrollably. This personality trait can be problematic during delicate operations or missions where discretion is necessary.

SCP-1138 has not displayed any anomalous abilities at this time, but it is recommended that she is not allowed to interact with any other SCPs or Foundation personnel outside of operational procedures.

It is theorized that SCP-1138 may be more susceptible to manipulation or persuasion by entities or individuals with charismatic personalities, and this possibility must be taken into consideration when handling her.

Addendum: SCP-1138 has proven to be extremely effective in her cover job as a delivery driver, often gaining access to secure facilities through her charm and social abilities. Her utility will continue to be monitored and assessed for further potential use in covert operations.
