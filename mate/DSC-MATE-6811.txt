Item #: 6811

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6811 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate medical supplies as needed. SCP-6811 should be allowed to continue its work as a veterinarian, with additional emotional support counseling provided as needed. Any visits from D-class personnel must be accompanied by at least one armed guard.

Description: SCP-6811 is a male human of average height and weight, with several distinct physical features. SCP-6811's face is covered in spots, and his smile is described as "unnerving" by some Foundation staff. SCP-6811's eyes are red, similar in appearance to those of a clown. SCP-6811's head is adorned with a peak spike, and he wears a green cross earring in one ear. SCP-6811 always wears a medical mask over his mouth.

SCP-6811 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and often seems attuned to the emotions of others. This can lead SCP-6811 to exhibit humor in situations where it might otherwise be inappropriate. Despite his unnerving appearance, SCP-6811 is generally well-liked among Foundation personnel and has been known to converse with SCPs with whom he has developed closer relationships.

SCP-6811 works as a veterinarian, and has displayed a special affinity for animals. Many animals seem to be more at ease around SCP-6811 than human veterinarians. SCP-6811 is notably skilled at calming agitated animals and helping them through medical procedures.

Addendum: Despite SCP-6811's generally benevolent behavior, it is not to be underestimated. SCP-6811 has been known to exhibit physical strength beyond what would be expected of a normal human, and is able to resist sedation in many circumstances. SCP-6811's potential for danger should not be ignored.
