Item #: DSC-MATE-7792

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7792 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to her occupation as a firefighter, she is to be granted access to the designated DogeSoundClub firefighting equipment and training protocol. Any request made outside of Foundation-related affairs is to be denied. DSC-MATE-7792 is also to receive monthly psychological evaluations to monitor any changes in her obsessive behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-7792 is a female human of average height with distinct facial features, such as red lips and blue clown-like eyes. Her hair is a shade of brown that was popular during the 1990s. DSC-MATE-7792 commonly wears a jade earring on one of her ears.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-7792 is extremely detail-oriented, sometimes bordering on obsessive behavior. This can be seen in her everyday life through the alphabetizing of her spice rack or color-coding her closet. Her obsession with order can be described as contained and does not seem to affect her ability to carry out her job efficiently. However, DSC-MATE-7792 can display an over-the-top response to mistakes, which is a concern regarding her emotional stability.

DSC-MATE-7792 is employed as a firefighter by the local government. According to interviews conducted by Foundation personnel, DSC-MATE-7792 claims that the appeal of the job is the opportunity to organize and control the uncontrollable nature of fire. Despite her seemingly mundane job, a thorough background check revealed no abnormalities outside of her obsessive tendencies.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7792 became aware of the DogeSoundClub after discovering a package of DSC-500, "Panacea," which she mistook for her prescribed medication. Foundation agents infiltrated her home and retrieved the package without incident. ██ years after the initial discovery, DSC-MATE-7792 is currently cooperative and has refused requests to divulge any information about the DogeSoundClub to civilians.
