Item #: 7783

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7783 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber with a minimum size of 3 meters by 3 meters. All surfaces must be made of industrial-grade steel to prevent the subject from digging its way out. The chamber must be equipped with a ventilation system capable of filtering out any allergens that may adversely affect its health. The subject is to be fed a diet of fresh vegetables, hay, and water.

Description: Subject 7783 is a male Lop-eared Rabbit of average size and weight. It speaks English fluently and is certified as a licensed veterinarian. It has a frightened expression on its face, and its mouth remains in a state of constant agitation. Its glasses are for near-sightedness which it has not been contained for, as they are deemed non-threatening to its containment.

The subject's head is not arranged of the normal rabbit type, it has not been observed to exhibit any additional properties that could be deemed anomalous. The rabbit has a set of goggles on its forehead, which it seems to enjoy wearing as a personal accessory. There is a small green tint to the fur around the subject's face, although when examined in high-definition photographic equipment, the coloration appears normal allowing for it not to be considered part of the object of containment.

Subject 7783 has a jade earring adorning its left ear which, despite numerous attempts to remove, has remained firmly attached. It also wears a gold chain around its neck, but the purpose and origin of this item have not been determined. The subject's personality is that of a highly rebellious individual who shows a distaste for being told what to do by external entities. It has been documented breaking rules and finding loopholes to bend to undermine orders from its superiors, often for no other purpose than amusement.

Addendum: The subject has been observed to manifest limited anomalous abilities, as it has the ability to sense the negative energy in individuals with altered states of mind, allowing it to diagnose and treat patients suffering from various psychological ailments. However, it remains to be seen how its abilities may function in conjunction with the properties of the DogeSoundClub, so further testing will be required.
