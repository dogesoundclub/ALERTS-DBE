Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7172 must be located within a secure holding cell at all times. Any interactions with said subject must be monitored and supervised by personnel with Level 3 clearance or above. 7172 is to be fed a diet of raw meat and provided with a designated litter box. In the event of any unexplainable incidents or disturbances, a suppression team must be dispatched to the vicinity immediately.

Description: Subject 7172 appears to be a full-grown male tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall, with striking blue clown eyes. The subject appears to possess a significant amount of strength and agility that exceeds that of any known physical limits. He wears a distinctive bucket hat on his head with a two-color band on its forehead. 7172 also sports a shiny red cross earring on both ears, and a bright red scarf around his neck.

Personality: Despite subject 7172's intimidating stature, he presents a surprisingly traditional and reserved personality. He appears to be highly respectful of his cultural roots and adheres to them with great reverence. He also possesses an acute sense of humor, and his lighthearted nature has led him to share amusing stories and jokes passed down through his family and community. However, this should not be taken as a measure of weakness, as he has demonstrated the ability to become highly aggressive and territorial when provoked or threatened.

Note: It is unclear how subject 7172 came to exist in the human world or how it acquired such attributes. It is highly recommended not to approach the subject unless authorized personnel are available. Any attempts to engage with the subject beyond authorized access will result in immediate apprehension and disciplinary action.
