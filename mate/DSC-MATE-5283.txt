Item #: 5283

Object Class: Anthropomorphic

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5283 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a ventilation system that is capable of distributing an oxygen rich atmosphere throughout the enclosure. It is mandatory that a minimum of one Level 3 personnel supervise SCP-5283 at all times. Access to SCP-5283's containment chamber requires approval from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-5283 is an anthropomorphic monkey approximately two meters in height. It retains a pair of slick nerd glasses, colored in golden-yellow. The head of SCP-5283 is parted pink, forming a curly mane accentuated by a pair of small jade earrings. The subject is often seen wearing a red scarf, measuring two meters in length, and an LED gas mask, customized for its face. It is hypothesized that SCP-5283's gas mask enhances its senses and mitigates any intrinsic hazards present within the atmosphere.

SCP-5283 is known to exhibit sporadic and impulsive traits, indicative of a form of intrepidness uncommon in members of its species. Its extroverted tendencies often prompt it to engage in high-risk behaviors like jumping off cliffs, hanging from buildings, or riding motorcycles. These traits have been observed to manifest in humorous situations; however, SCP-5283's tendency to act impulsively hints at a potentially more severe underlying condition.

As of writing, SCP-5283 has been employed by Foundation personnel as a car salesman. SCP-5283's communicative abilities exhibit excellent proficiency in convincing its customers of the benefits of purchasing a car, often resulting in high-profit gains for the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-5283's gas mask has been empirically tested, and it has been confirmed that the mask is capable of filtering and, in most cases, neutralizing dangerous pathogens or gaseous toxins. Further research on this topic is necessary to determine how such effects are possible.
