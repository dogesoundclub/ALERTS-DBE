Item #: SCP-5598

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5598 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Its behavior must be monitored by trained personnel and any changes in its demeanor must be recorded. Interaction with SCP-5598 may only be conducted with permission from the Site Director or Assistant Director.

Description: SCP-5598 appears to be a male monkey of an unknown species, dressed in business attire commonly worn by car salespeople. It stands at approximately 1 meter in height and weighs approximately 20kg. The creature's head is partially parted with pink hair that appears to have been styled with gel or some other similar substance. It also wears a pair of horned rim glasses which often slide down its nose, along with a jade earring on one of its ears.

SCP-5598 is known to carry a gold chain around its neck, which is believed to be purely ornamental. The monkey's personality is what sets it apart from non-anomalous primates. It has an introspective nature which causes it to be lost in thought for extended periods. This can result in the creature unintentionally walking into utility poles or tripping over obstacles in its way.

SCP-5598's ability to think deeply and reflect on its surroundings is believed to be linked to cognitive abilities beyond the scope of non-anomalous animals. In order to study and potentially utilize SCP-5598's unique properties, further testing is required.

Addendum: Due to its employment within the automotive industry, SCP-5598 is thought to have the ability to influence decision-making processes in humans. The Foundation, therefore, believes that extra caution must be taken when working with SCP-5598, and all interactions must be carefully monitored.
