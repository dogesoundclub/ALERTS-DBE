SCP-9966 is a humanoid entity known to the urban fantasy community as "The Jester." This mysterious creature disguises itself as a human male and works as a reporter. It possesses a pair of blood-red clown eyes that seem to mesmerize its targets, allowing it to extract information from them without resistance.

The Jester wears a short peak cap on its head and a gold earring on one ear. It has an addiction to shiny trinkets and is often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck as well as carrying around a candy stick. Despite its whimsical appearance, the Jester is not to be underestimated.

SCP-9966 has a dual personality, presenting a sense of duty and responsibility to its job, but it also knows how to have fun. Its charming demeanor allows it to gain the trust of its targets quite quickly, making it a valuable addition to any investigative team. It uses this to its advantage to gather information in the form of confessions.

The Jester's mischievous behavior can lead to humorous situations, such as being the life of the party and getting everyone to dance or sing along to its favorite songs. However, agents have found that these traits can sometimes be its weakness, as the Jester's focus can waver from its assignments.

Under no circumstances should personnel let down their guard around SCP-9966, as its true form and abilities are still unknown. The Jester should be approached with caution and only under the direct supervision of a Level 3 agent.
