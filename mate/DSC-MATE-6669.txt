Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6669 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with access to a computer and internet connection. Any interaction with SCP-6669 must be supervised by at least two trained personnel. Any attempt to provoke SCP-6669 or trigger its fear response is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-6669 appears to be a humanoid Tiger, standing at 6 feet tall. It is capable of fluent speech and is highly proficient in programming languages. SCP-6669 is typically seen wearing a Doge hat on its head, normal glasses on its eyes, and a Red Cross earring on its ears. It also wears a gold chain and carries a whistle as accessories.

SCP-6669's most notable facial feature is its frightened mouth, which appears to be in a constant state of alarm. Its forehead has a unique two-color band pattern. When approached, SCP-6669 may exhibit signs of anxiety, shaking and avoiding eye contact. However, when calm, it has been observed to have a quirky sense of humor and a dry, deadpan delivery. SCP-6669 tends to be highly analytical and logical in its thinking and interactions.

SCP-6669's anomalous abilities manifest mostly in cyberspace. SCP-6669 has been known to hack into highly secure systems and code complex algorithms at lightning speed. Its programming abilities are highly advanced, surpassing that of even the most skilled computer engineers. Its abilities are not fully understood, which has made it extremely valuable to the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-6669's fear response was triggered during testing when presented with a mirror. SCP-6669's eyes turned a bright red, and it emitted an ultrasonic whistle that caused severe damage to nearby equipment. When questioned about this event, SCP-6669 refused to answer and only displayed signs of severe anxiety. All future testing utilizing visual representations of SCP-6669 are strictly prohibited.
