Item #: SCP-5120

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5120 is to be kept in a standard monkey containment chamber at all times. Any and all beautician equipment must be removed from the containment chamber to prevent SCP-5120 from using it for its own purposes. SCP-5120 is allowed to express artistic inclinations within reason, but any artwork or written material must be screened by a member of the research team prior to dissemination.

Description: SCP-5120 is a male monkey with unique features. Its face appears to be in a constant state of fear, with a permanently open mouth. Its eyes are akin to that of a clown with bright blue pigments highlighting the irises. SCP-5120 has a blue bandana atop its head and a gold earring in each ear. It often wears a silver chain, and a gas mask is present on occasion.

SCP-5120 is a beautician by trade, but it is uncertain how this particular skillset was acquired. SCP-5120 has displayed an artistic side that is possibly indicative of intelligence beyond its current classification.

Personality: SCP-5120 is a quirky character and has been noted to have an artistic and creative personality. Although they are curious and have a high degree of resourcefulness, they are highly susceptible to fear and exhibit anxiety-like symptoms. Furthermore, SCP-5120 has been known to pursue the most unlikely avenues of creativity, often surprising the research team with its sudden bursts of inspiration.

SCP-5120 has been observed painting, drawing, and writing, among other things. The research team believes that the creative process helps mitigate some of the anxieties present in SCP-5120's daily life. However, any creative output is subject to approval by the research team to ensure no harm is inflicted on other SCP objects or the general population.
