SCP-7480 is a peculiar news anchor, with distinct traits that can only be described as...peculiar. The first thing that one might notice about 7480 is his spots. Those typically associated with cheetahs or leopards, these spots cover his face in a somewhat erratic pattern, almost as though they were applied by an unskilled hand.

Then there's his mouth, which always seems to be open in a state of frozen terror that belies his chosen occupation. One can almost imagine him screaming in absolute panic, but no sound ever emerges from his lips. It's a rather unnerving sight to behold, to say the least.

But the most disconcerting feature of SCP-7480 is undoubtedly his eyes. A bright, almost luminous red, that seem to contain a manic energy unbound by human constraints. They're usually wide open, and while they're clearly not clown makeup, they do have the same look of possessed gaiety associated with a clown's grin.

Other oddities of SCP-7480 include the thick layers of green skin that seem to bubble and fold upon his head, almost like an organic helmet. And then there's the goggle that sits perched atop his forehead, the lenses always fogged over as though he had been swimming in a steamy swamp.
 
Despite all of these strange features, however, SCP-7480 seems to have a great sense of humor that he uses to delightful effect. He can lighten the mood with a funny story or acting silly, no matter the situation. It's hard not to chuckle at his antics or feel more relaxed when he's around. 

Nevertheless, it is advised to observe SCP-7480 from a safe distance, as he exhibits some inexplicable phenomena that may pose a potential threat to the unsuspecting observer. Caution is strongly advised.
