Item #: SCP-1660

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1660 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell and allowed access to beauty and hair products for her occupation as a beautician. All interactions with SCP-1660 are to be monitored and recorded.

Description: SCP-1660 is a human female of average height and weight with blonde hair and green eyes. Facial features include purple lips and a pink nose. She wears a green cross earring, a silver chain and a gas mask with LED lights. Her eyes have been surgically altered with VR Jade LED implants that enhance her beauty-related skills.

SCP-1660 was discovered in a beauty salon in ██████, USA, where she worked as a beautician. She possesses a range of skills, including hair styling, make-up application, manicure and pedicure. SCP-1660 has a tendency to rely heavily on her routines and can become stubborn when faced with unexpected challenges.

Interview logs reveal that SCP-1660 is aware of her anomalous abilities related to her profession and has expressed a desire to join the Foundation to further her expertise. SCP-1660 has no memory of how she acquired her abilities or why she wears her gas mask.

SCP-1660 is not considered dangerous and is cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, her level of loyalty to the Foundation remains to be determined. Future testing and observation of SCP-1660 are ongoing.

Addendum: Following a routine check by security personnel, it was discovered that SCP-1660 had used her beauty-related skills to manipulate the security cameras in her cell. All electronic devices, including cameras, will be thoroughly inspected before placement in SCP-1660's cell.
