SCP-4218, also known as "The Joker," is a human male of average height and build. His head is adorned with a normal blonde hairstyle, while his ears are decorated with a single gold earring. His most notable features are the spots on his face and the frightened expression that his mouth often displays.

SCP-4218's fashion choices are eclectic, to say the least. He can often be seen wearing a red scarf around his neck, alongside a normal gas mask that he seems to wear both for utility and decoration.

Despite his odd appearance, SCP-4218 is a skilled car salesman, using his charisma and natural sense of humor to make customers feel at ease. Those who interact with him often report feeling a sense of comfort and levity, thanks to his willingness to tell jokes and stories to lighten the mood.

It should be noted, however, that SCP-4218 may take his humor to extremes at times. Witnesses have reported him engaging in risky pranks or telling inappropriate jokes, which can lead to awkward or dangerous situations. As with all SCPs, caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-4218 to ensure the safety of all involved.
