Subject 7027, also known as "The Empathetic Barrister," is a species-defying anomaly that has taken the form of a monkey. While physically unimposing, this entity boasts a powerful gift: an unwavering ability to sense the emotions of those around it. This rare trait has proven invaluable in its work as a lawyer, allowing it to sway juries and judges with ease.

Despite this ability, 7027 is burdened by a crippling sense of fear, as evidenced by its perpetually frightened mouth. It's not entirely clear what the source of this paranoia is, but some speculate that it may be related to its unique abilities.

In addition to its physical features, 7027 is often adorned with a jade earring, a symbol of its status as a licensed practitioner of law.

One of the most unique aspects of this entity is its personality. Whereas many of its kind are driven by self-preservation, 7027 is driven by a fierce sense of empathy. Its attunement to the emotions of others has made it an invaluable asset in times of crisis, providing comfort and support to those in need.

Despite its daunting appearance and formidable abilities, it is said that those who cross paths with 7027 cannot help but be touched by its infectious humor and unwavering sense of justice.
