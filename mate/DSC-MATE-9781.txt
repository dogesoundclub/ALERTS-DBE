Item #: SCP-9781

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9781 is no longer a threat and thus does not require containment of any kind. However, all personnel who encounter SCP-9781 are to exercise caution due to the possibility of residual anomalous properties. Any suspicious behavior is to be reported to the current Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-9781 was a female human identified as a doctor with an enthusiastic personality. They were often seen wearing a gold chain and a normal gas mask as accessories. SCP-9781's most notable feature was their red clown eyes, which emitted a constant glow. SCP-9781 also had a green cross earring on one of their ears.

SCP-9781 was known for their intense energy and enthusiasm, often getting excited about things that others found mundane or uninteresting. Their infectious energy could lead to humorous situations, but it also caused some concern among Foundation personnel due to the possibility of anomalous properties.

Further investigation revealed that SCP-9781's anomalous properties were linked to their red clown eyes. SCP-9781 had the ability to manipulate the emotions of others with their gaze, causing them to feel an overwhelming sense of excitement and euphoria. This effect was temporary but could be dangerous if misused.

SCP-9781 was recovered by Foundation agents during an investigation into suspicious medical practices linked to numerous cases of unexplainable excitement and euphoria. After a thorough examination, SCP-9781 was confirmed to have no knowledge of their anomalous abilities, and their memory was erased before they were released back into society.

Addendum: Due to the potential danger of SCP-9781's anomalous properties, all personnel are reminded to remain vigilant when interacting with individuals displaying unusual behaviors or appearances.
