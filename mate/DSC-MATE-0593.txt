Description: Item 593 is a female humanoid, officially classified as a human. She has orange stripes running down her face, gold earrings on her ears and wears a choker around her neck. Her most distinct features, however, are her blue clown-like eyes and medical mask, which she refuses to remove.

Item 593 is a skilled fashion designer, with her designs being highly sought after. She has a strong sense of empathy, which allows her to read and manipulate the emotions of others. Item 593 uses this ability to her advantage, often using her designs to create powerful emotional connections between people and changing their interpretations of certain topics.

Her empathetic abilities have proven to be both a blessing and curse. While her ability has allowed her to achieve a level of success, she is also highly sensitive to the emotions of others. Even the slightest negative emotion can cause her severe emotional distress, leading her to be isolated and avoid social interaction.

It is imperative that the staff assigned to Item 593 should avoid emotional contact and maintain a professional demeanor at all times. Item 593 plays an important role in fashion design, and her emotional manipulation should not be taken lightly.
