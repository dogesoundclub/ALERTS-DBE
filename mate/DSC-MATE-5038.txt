Item #: SCP-5038

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5038 is to be located in a standard humanoid containment cell, with daily monitoring by security personnel. Any information regarding SCP-5038's whereabouts or activities must be immediately reported to on-site security personnel.

SCP-5038 is to be supplied with a standard-issue police uniform, and any weapons or tools necessary for their occupation as a Traffic Officer. All communication with SCP-5038 must be conducted via written notes, as there is a risk of temporary memetic contagion when SCP-5038 speaks.

Description: SCP-5038 is a female human, approximately 28 years old, standing at 5'8" tall. SCP-5038's face is marked with orange stripes, which extend from cheek to cheek. SCP-5038's eyes are replaced by VR Rainbow LEDs, which can display a variety of colors and patterns. SCP-5038's head resembles that of a pink rabbit, with long ears that curl upward and end with a green cross earring.

SCP-5038's mouth is covered by a medical mask, which they wear at all times. SCP-5038 will only remove their mask in the presence of medical personnel or when it is necessary for their occupation.

SCP-5038 possesses a personality that can be characterized as absent-minded and forgetful. SCP-5038's attention can easily be captured by external stimuli, leading to a lack of focus and concentration. This behavior can lead to disastrous consequences, as SCP-5038 may forget essential tasks or events.

SCP-5038's occupation as a Traffic Officer is a useful cover for their anomalous abilities. It is reported that SCP-5038 has successfully navigated heavy traffic situations and identified traffic violators without incident. However, there have been reports of SCP-5038 engaging in erratic behavior while on duty, which may be linked to their anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-5038's whereabouts are currently unknown. Information regarding SCP-5038's sighting should be reported immediately to on-site security personnel.
