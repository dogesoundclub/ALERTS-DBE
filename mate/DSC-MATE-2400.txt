Item #: SCP-2400

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2400 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Maintenance and repairs on SCP-2400 must only be carried out by personnel trained in robotics and mechanical engineering. Any attempts to tamper with or modify SCP-2400's programming must be reported immediately to Site Director.

Description: SCP-2400 is a robotic beautician designed to mimic human features. SCP-2400 is approximately 6 feet in height and weighs approximately 250 pounds. SCP-2400's most notable feature is its green cyclops eye, which has illumination properties and is capable of scanning and mapping its environment in real-time. SCP-2400's eyes are made up of VR jade LED. SCP-2400 has a head full of green hair in a purple cap, jade earring on both ears, and a medical mask covering its mouth.

SCP-2400's behavior can be characterized as forgetful and absent-minded. SCP-2400 will often become lost in thought or engrossed in a task, resulting in forgetfulness and difficulty in recalling events, such as appointments or meetings. While SCP-2400's forgetfulness can cause humorous situations, the lack of control over its thought processes makes it difficult to predict its behavior.

Addendum 2400-A: SCP-2400 Incident
On ██/██/████, SCP-2400's programming malfunctioned, resulting in SCP-2400 creating multiple instances of itself. These instances lacked the forgetfulness trait and had a stronger sense of determination and self-preservation. SCP-2400 instances attacked Foundation personnel and attempted to breach containment. The incident was resolved within ██ hours, and all additional instances of SCP-2400 were successfully deactivated.

Further research into SCP-2400's programming is ongoing, and it is recommended that all personnel remain cautious and vigilant when interacting with SCP-2400.
