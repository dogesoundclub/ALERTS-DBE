Item #: SCP-1865

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-1865 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to SCP-1865's cooperative personality, interaction with research staff is encouraged for data collection purposes. However, any attempt of SCP-1865 to utilize its anomalous abilities must be reported to on-site supervisors immediately.

Description:
SCP-1865 appears to be a human male identified as a car salesman. SCP-1865 possesses an abnormal physical appearance, with orange stripes running along its face and its head parted pink. SCP-1865 wears a red scarf and a normal gas mask as accessories. Additionally, SCP-1865 has a goggle attachment on its forehead.

SCP-1865 displays a strong sense of intuition, allowing it to make accurate predictions of future events or sense emotional fluctuations in individuals. The accuracy of these predictions is inconsistent, but always occur with startling precision when they do happen. SCP-1865's abilities are believed to be a cognitohazard, though how they are generated and transmitted remains unknown.

Addendum-1:
SCP-1865 was contained after a witness reported a car salesman with "psychic" abilities. Foundation assets were dispatched to investigate and discovered SCP-1865. SCP-1865 was initially cooperative and offered to assist the Foundation in understanding its abilities in exchange for protection.

Addendum-2:
SCP-1865 has expressed interest in assisting the Foundation with predicting impending events, stating that its abilities may be useful in preventing catastrophic events. Further research into SCP-1865's abilities may be warranted.
