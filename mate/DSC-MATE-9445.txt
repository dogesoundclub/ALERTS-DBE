Item #: SCP-9445

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9445 is currently assigned to a Level 2 humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its ability to blend in with average human society, SCP-9445 is permitted limited contact with the outside world, but must be supervised at all times when interacting with other individuals. Interaction with SCP-9445 should be kept to a minimum in order to ensure its continued cooperation.

Description: SCP-9445 is a male human of average build and height. It has a number of distinguishable features, including spots on its face and VR Rainbow LED eyes. SCP-9445 also wears a blue bandana on its head and a jade earring in one ear. It is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette. SCP-9445 works as a real estate agent outside of Foundation containment.

SCP-9445 has demonstrated a laid-back and easy-going personality, which may cause it to underestimate danger or become too comfortable in otherwise tense situations. Despite this, SCP-9445 is fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones, and will not hesitate to confront those who insult them. Researchers have observed SCP-9445 engaging in heated arguments with individuals who have offended friends or family members.

Addendum: SCP-9445 was acquired by the Foundation after reports of abnormal behavior in its community. Upon initial contact, SCP-9445 did not display any aggressive behavior and easily complied with Foundation containment procedures. SCP-9445 has since been used to gather information about the anomalies within its community. Observation has shown it to be a useful asset in this regard due to its unique blend of social skills and protective nature.
