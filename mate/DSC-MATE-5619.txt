Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5619 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with no less than two armed guards posted outside. Any interaction with SCP-5619 must be approved by at least one Level 2 personnel or higher. Under no circumstances is SCP-5619 to be allowed access to any form of communication device.

Description: SCP-5619 is a male human with orange stripes on his face, along with a perpetually frightened mouth. He wears a retro cap with a two-color band on his forehead along with a jade earring and a silver chain. He is often seen wearing a normal gas mask, most likely to disguise himself.

SCP-5619 has shown a tendency to be very organized and efficient, which can often come off as controlling behavior. He takes charge of group projects or events, delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. This behavior often leads to humorous situations, as SCP-5619 tends to have no regard for traditional hierarchy or social conventions.

SCP-5619 possesses advanced knowledge of chemical compounds and weapons, making him a potential danger to the Foundation and society at large. He has expressed a desire to use his knowledge to cause chaos and destruction, making him a designated villain.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5619's unpredictable and dangerous nature, all personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with him. Any attempts at communication are to be carefully monitored and recorded for future reference. It is unknown if SCP-5619 has any connections to other anomalous entities or organizations, but all possible leads must be pursued to ensure containment.
