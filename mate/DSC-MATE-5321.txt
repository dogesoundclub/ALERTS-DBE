Item #: SCP-5321

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5321 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, fitted with high-strength steel bars reinforced with titanium alloy, and kept under constant video surveillance. SCP-5321 is to be provided with a specialized diet consisting of raw meat to maintain optimal health. In case of emergency or containment breach, personnel are advised to use extreme caution as SCP-5321 is a predator and may attack if feeling threatened.

Description: SCP-5321 is an anomalous tiger humanoid measuring 6'4" in height and weighing approximately 500lbs. SCP-5321 possesses a humanoid physique, but retains several physical traits of a tiger, such as stripes and fur, which are dark orange in color. SCP-5321's face features a frightened expression, with its mouth often open, revealing sharp teeth. SCP-5321's eyes resemble ski goggles, providing excellent night vision and thermal detection. SCP-5321 is often seen with a gold earring on its right ear, a silver chain around its neck, and a cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-5321 has an energetic and enthusiastic personality, often getting excited about mundane tasks or objects. This can cause SCP-5321 to become distracted, losing focus on important tasks. SCP-5321 is also known to enjoy getting others excited, which can lead to humorous situations. SCP-5321's eagerness can create a positive and upbeat environment, but can also become a cause for concern as it may put SCP-5321 and others in danger.

Addendum: SCP-5321 was brought to the Foundation's attention after reports of a tiger humanoid traffic officer making traffic stops on a busy highway. Reports state that SCP-5321 was capable of gesturing vehicles to pull over and even issuing tickets. The Foundation was able to apprehend SCP-5321 without incident and subsequently classified it as an SCP. SCP-5321 exhibits no unusual abilities, and its anomalous properties are strictly physical. Despite being sentient, SCP-5321 is unable to speak any known language, making it difficult to communicate with Foundation personnel.
