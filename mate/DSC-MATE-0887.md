Item #: DSC-MATE-887

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-887 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject's access to the outside world is restricted to standard banking hours, during which time they are allowed access to a computer terminal to perform their duties. DSC-MATE-887 is not to be approached by personnel unless accompanied by a trained contact specialist.

Description: DSC-MATE-887, a middle-aged human man, stands at 1.78 meters in height and weighs approximately 74 kilograms. The subject has a distinctive Mouth Spot, a prominent blemish on the left side of their lower lip. They are often seen wearing nerd glasses and a blue bandana on their head. DSC-MATE-887 frequently smokes cigarettes, despite standard Foundation protocols against smoking indoors.

DSC-MATE-887 is a banker by profession and is highly idealistic in their nature, with a strong desire to make the world a better place. This obsession with "righting the wrongs" has led them to engage in protesting and boycotting at times. Although this may seem harmless, DSC-MATE-887's conviction has proven to be a potential problem in the past.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-887's willingness to take action, the Foundation attempted to recruit the subject into their ranks as an agent. DSC-MATE-887 denied the offer, stating they were content with attempting to make the world better through legal means. Further attempts to convince DSC-MATE-887 have been deemed unnecessary by the O5 council.
