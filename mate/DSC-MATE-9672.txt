Item #: SCP-9672

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9672 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Physical contact with SCP-9672 is prohibited without approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-9672 may not participate in any political activities or events, and access to any sensitive political information is strictly prohibited. Any attempts by SCP-9672 to influence political decisions or public opinion are to be reported immediately to Site-███.

Description: SCP-9672 is a human female politician, approximately 45 years old. SCP-9672 exhibits unique physical characteristics, which include spots on the skin, purple lips, blue clown eyes, green colored hair with edge curl, and a two-color band on the forehead. SCP-9672 also wears a gold earring and a gold chain.

SCP-9672 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This high level of levity caused the Foundation to take caution when interviewing SCP-9672 as the authenticity of her SCP status is questionable.

SCP-9672 was previously a successful politician, but upon discovery of her anomalous attributes was reached out to by the SCP foundation. In the past, SCP-9672 was known for her charismatic abilities to sway public opinion and could influence decision making with ease.

SCP-9672 has not exhibited any hostile behavior, but the Foundation recognizes the potential of SCP-9672's abilities if utilized for personal gain.

Addendum: After interviews with SCP-9672, it was discovered that SCP-9672 could control the duration and number of laughs that people make around them. We suspect that the range of this ability expands past the immediate vicinity of SCP-9672 and could likely affect an entire arena of people. Testing is underway to determine the extend of SCP-9672's abilities.
