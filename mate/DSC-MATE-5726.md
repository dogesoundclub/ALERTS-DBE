DSC-MATE-5726, also known as "The Jester", is a male robot villain with a unique appearance. Its single green cyclops eye peers out from beneath a purple cap adorned with green hair. The Jester's face is drawn with a frightened mouth and normal glasses, which stand in contrast to its imposing frame.

The Jester often wears a gold chain around its neck and a gas mask over its metallic face, perhaps to protect itself from the toxic fumes of its own creation. Though often perceived as an enigmatic and solitary entity, the Jester has been known to possess a sociable and outgoing personality, relishing the attention it receives from those around it.

However, its sense of humor can be dark, and its jokes and stories are often laced with a sense of malevolence that leaves its audience feeling disconcerted. Despite its entertaining nature, the Jester is not to be underestimated, as it possesses a formidable intellect and possesses a willingness to use its abilities to cause chaos and destruction at every turn.
