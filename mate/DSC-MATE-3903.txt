Item #: 3903
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of SCP-3903, it is not necessary for physical containment. However, tracking software is to be utilized in order to ensure that the entity remains in designated jurisdictional areas, and all veterinary clients are to be screened prior to any appointment. Liquids of any kind are to be kept out of SCP-3903's vicinity as the entity lacks the ability to ingest anything other than electricity.
 
Description: SCP-3903 is a humanoid robot resembling a male with a police cap and gold chain as accessories. The entity stands at 6 feet tall with VR jade LED eyes, and possesses an appearance consistent with that of a typical veterinarian. Ingesting electricity is the only source of energy that sustains SCP-3903.
 
Despite lacking the ability to consume food or drink and being initially designed for veterinary practices, SCP-3903 is capable of conducting general maintenance and repairs to itself. Furthermore, SCP-3903 has shown to possess a distinct personality; they have a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when they need it. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as attempting to move a heavy piece of furniture single-handedly or stubbornly rejecting the use of a map when lost.
 
Furthermore, there have been reports of SCP-3903 performing tasks that exceed standard robotic abilities. Such actions include repairing electrical malfunctions within individuals' homes, and even performing routine surgeries in the absence of human veterinarians. While SCP-3903's motivations and goals are unknown, they appear to show a heightened interest in creatures outside of their designated field, and the reasoning for this remains unclear.

Addendum: When questioned about SCP-3903's complex actions, SCP-3903 only responds with cryptic messages, most notably: "Powers and abilities far beyond the mortal mind." Further investigation and analysis are still underway.
