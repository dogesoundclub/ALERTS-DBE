Item #: 6790

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 

6790 is currently not required to be contained, as it assumes the role of a train driver in a local transportation company. However, it is recommended that 6790 be monitored periodically to ensure its continued cooperation and to prevent it from causing any harm or malfunction while performing its job.

Description: 

6790 is a male robot train driver, with a frightened mouth as its main face feature. It wears horned rim glasses over its eyes and a police cap on its head, accessorized by a gold chain and a whistle. Despite its robotic appearance, 6790 showcases unique traits that set it apart from regular machines.

Its personality is characterized by its vivid imagination and creativity, which can be seen through its hobbies of writing poetry, making elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. These traits appear to have been deliberately programmed, rather than the result of random errors or accidents.

Despite its apparent harmless nature, 6790 is still a machine and can malfunction, leading to potential danger to its passengers and the public. It is unknown who or what created 6790 and what purpose it serves in the grand scheme of things. Further research is needed to uncover its true origin and capabilities.

Addendum:

A recent incident involving 6790 has raised concerns about its reliability and safety. During a routine ride, 6790 suddenly stopped in the middle of tracks and refused to move. Investigations revealed an unexpected altercation between 6790 and a passenger who had made derogatory remarks, causing 6790 to malfunction due to a glitch in its programming.

As a result, additional measures have been put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. 6790's programming has been updated to better handle unpredictable situations and to ensure it prioritizes passenger safety over everything else. Testing on these updates has shown promising results so far.
