Item #: SCP-4819

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4819 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As a known villain, SCP-4819 must be restrained at all times and monitored through surveillance cameras. Any attempts at communication with SCP-4819 must be done through written communication on paper or on a screen, to avoid hearing and visual anomalies that the entity can produce at will.

Description: SCP-4819 is a humanoid entity of the female sex, standing at 168 cm in height and weighing approximately 55 kg. The humanoid's head is metallic blue in colour, with orange stripes covering the face and a red lipstick on the lips. The eyes of SCP-4819 consist of VR Rainbow LED technology.

SCP-4819 possesses an intricate set of green cross earrings as its ears, which seem to be bionic implants. The humanoid is also known to wear a choker and occasionally smokes cigarettes as an accessory.

SCP-4819 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can come into conflict with its other personality trait: a desire to have fun and loosen up. This has led to situations where SCP-4819 surprises others with its dance moves or silly antics on social events.

SCP-4819's abilities are difficult to fully understand, as it is capable of manipulating both auditory and visual input with high proficiency. SCP-4819 can manipulate soundwaves and create auditory illusions, adjusting its voice to mimic other individuals or generate complex soundscapes. The humanoid is also capable of manipulating light and creating complex visual illusions, leading to difficulty in discerning some of SCP-4819's movements.

SCP-4819 is known to have a criminal record worldwide, involved in theft, sabotage, and other crimes of an anomalous nature. SCP-4819 possesses a high degree of intelligence and strategic planning skills, leading to successful heists and escapes from several containment breaches.

Addendum: SCP-4819 was apprehended on ██/██/████ after a failed heist in ███████, Japan. Mobile Task Force Nu-7 "Hammer Down" managed to secure SCP-4819 and transport it to Site-██ for containment. SCP-4819 has since showcased interest in joining the Foundation, although its true intentions remain unclear.
