Description: DSC-MATE-6698 appears to be a female politician in her mid-40s, standing at 5'10" tall, and weighing approximately 170lbs. The entity's facial features are marked with prominent spots and bright red lips, with the added adornment of a retro cap accessorized with a gold chain.

DSC-MATE-6698's most peculiar feature is its use of a pair of Virtual Reality (VR) jade LED eyes, which are believed to act as a means for the entity to observe its surroundings from a distance, providing it with enhanced abilities for monitoring and manipulating its environment.
