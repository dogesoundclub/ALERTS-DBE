Item #: SCP-3291

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3291 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and is not allowed to disclose any information regarding the SCP Foundation or its operations. SCP-3291 is to be given access to a secure communication channel in order to provide leads on potential anomalies, but is not to be directly involved in any sort of containment or retrieval operations.

Description: SCP-3291 is a human female with a charming smile that has often been used to get her way. While her appearance is unremarkable, she is distinguishable by her red cross earring, and the constant presence of a cigarette. SCP-3291's eyes are obscured by normal prescription glasses, but no abnormalities have been noted in her vision.

SCP-3291's personality is characterized by her reliability and organization, but she is also stubborn and resistant to change. Despite her resistance, SCP-3291 has been found to be an invaluable resource due to her journalistic background, and her ability to provide leads on potential anomalies.

Interviews with SCP-3291 have revealed that she has a hard time letting go of routine, and often struggles to accept new ideas. When faced with unexpected changes or challenges, SCP-3291 has been known to exhibit humorous reactions.

Addendum: SCP-3291 has been instrumental in the capture and containment of several anomalies. However, her personal safety has been threatened as a result of her involvement with the Foundation. It is therefore imperative that her safety is maintained at all times.
