Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3023 is to be kept in a standard containment cell at all times, with reinforced walls and an electrified fence as added security measures. All personnel are advised to enter wearing protective gear, as contact with Subject 3023 may cause injury or death. No communication is to be established with the subject, and no attempt to understand or estimate its intelligence should be made.

Description: Subject 3023 is a male tiger, approximately seven feet tall when standing on its hind legs. Its eyes are concealed behind horn-rimmed glasses, and its head is adorned with a Doge hat. The tiger sports a jade earring on one of its ears, and wears a gold chain around its neck at all times. Its most notable accessory is an LED gas mask that is fused onto its face, which creates a sense of instability and unease in any who see it.

Subject 3023 has demonstrated a strong sense of idealism, with an unyielding desire to make the world a better place. It frequently engages in activities such as protests or boycotts against companies or causes that it finds objectionable. Its intentions behind these actions are unclear, and it is widely considered to be a volatile and unpredictable entity.

Addendum: Due to its unpredictable nature, Subject 3023 has been designated as Euclid. All personnel are advised to maintain a safe distance and report any concerning behavior immediately.
