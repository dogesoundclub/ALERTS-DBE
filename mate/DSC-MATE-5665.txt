Item #: SCP-5665

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5665 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no special requirements. Due to their profession, they may be allowed access to specific areas of Site-██ and the train yard with proper authorization from Level 3 personnel. Interaction with SCP-5665 should be limited to necessary communication only.

Description: SCP-5665 is a male human with several unique physical traits. They possess a spot on their mouth that appears to resemble a birthmark. Additionally, SCP-5665's facial expression often appears frightened or nervous, even in non-threatening situations. Their eyes are equipped with VR rainbow LED technology that allows them to receive live feeds from surveillance cameras located throughout the train system. SCP-5665's head is naturally parted pink in color, and they wear a gold earring in each ear. They also wear a gold chain as accessories.

SCP-5665's personality is described as laid-back and easy-going, but with a strong sense of loyalty towards their loved ones. They can be protective and defensive of their friends and family to the point of conflict. SCP-5665 works as a train driver and has demonstrated proficiency in navigating train systems without error. However, due to their tendency to become easily frightened or panicked, they must be monitored closely in high-pressure situations.

Addendum: SCP-5665's unique physical traits and personality may be a result of exposure to SCP-███ during their childhood. Further investigation into the source is ongoing.
