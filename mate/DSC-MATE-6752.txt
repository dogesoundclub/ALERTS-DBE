Item #: SCP-6752

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6752 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site ██. It is allowed limited access to the outside world provided a day's notice is given for its escorts. It must also remain under close observation by on-site personnel at all times.

Description: SCP-6752 refers to a male humanoid of tiger species, with a height of 5ft 3inches and a weight of 165lbs. Incorporated into its appearance are normal glasses and a blue bandana. A gold chain hangs around its neck, and a whistle can be seen in its possession. SCP-6752 often carries a scared expression, with a frightened mouth being the most notable feature of its face.

SCP-6752 is highly observant and displays an excellent attention to detail, exhibiting a talent for gift-giving. However, it can become overly concerned with selecting the perfect gift and spend long amounts of time agonizing over what to present to a receiver. It can get anxious and may need reassurance, especially when it comes to particular situations.

It is a train driver by trade; SCP-6752 is highly skilled and keeps a steady hand when conducting trains. It is essential to note that SCP-6752 has been known to display erratic behavior when operating trains with faulty equipment or untrained drivers.

Addendum: SCP-6752 has been found to be susceptible to mind-altering and psychic phenomena. All contact with any mind-affecting substances or entities is to be discontinued. It is recommended that SCP-6752 is granted time off for mental health assessments.
