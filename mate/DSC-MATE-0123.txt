Item #: 123

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-123 is not to be left unsupervised around other SCP artifacts or unauthorized personnel. All personnel are required to wear protective equipment and avoid direct contact with SCP-123's face or head. Any instances of unexpected emotional outbursts or physical transformations are to be reported immediately to the on-site supervisor.

Description:
SCP-123 appears to be a female humanoid with distinctive features that include orange stripes across her face and a pink rabbit head. Her eyes are modified with VR Rainbow LED technology. SCP-123's ears are adorned with a red cross earring and she is often seen carrying a cigarette. Notably, SCP-123 exhibits a deep empathy for others, which has been observed to cause emotional outbursts and transformations of her physical form. 

Personality:
SCP-123 displays a strong bond with animals and nature, suggesting possible association with previous experience in veterinary studies. The subject's empathetic nature is a concern as it shows potential for interference with the containment of other SCP specimens. Instances of physical transformations are often preceded by an emotional breakdown following exposure to trauma or suffering. Although SCP-123 does not appear to pose an immediate danger, further study is necessary to evaluate the risks of prolonged exposure.
