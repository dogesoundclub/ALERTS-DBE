Item #: 8505

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8505 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-8505 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-8505 is allowed access to art supplies and a sewing machine upon request.

Description: SCP-8505 is a male human of normal physical appearance, with blonde hair and spotted skin. Of note are the two-color band on SCP-8505's forehead, the green cross earring on its left ear, and goggles frequently worn on its forehead. SCP-8505 is often observed wearing a medical mask over its mouth. SCP-8505's occupation is that of a fashion designer, and it has shown great skill in creating high-end fashion garments using various materials at its disposal.

SCP-8505's most notable trait is its strong sense of intuition, which sometimes seems like psychic powers. It has displayed the ability to predict future events and sense the emotional state of others, often with a high degree of accuracy. SCP-8505's abilities have not been fully tested, but it is recommended that caution is taken when discussing matters related to future events or personal emotions in its presence.

SCP-8505 is generally cooperative and polite but can become easily agitated when its creative abilities are challenged. It has been known to react negatively to criticism and dismiss the opinions of those it deems to be inferior to its own taste.

Addendum: SCP-8505 has submitted several textile designs for use in containment-garment production, which have been approved. SCP-8505's creative outlets are now closely monitored to ensure the security of the Foundation.
