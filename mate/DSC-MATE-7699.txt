Item #: 7699

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7699 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber should be brightly lit and adorned with rabbit-themed decorations to help ease SCP-7699's anxiety. All incoming and outgoing communication must be monitored and reviewed by at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-7699 is a humanoid entity with a pink rabbit head, orange stripes on its face, and a constant smile. Its forehead features a two-color band and its ears are adorned with a green cross earring. SCP-7699 often carries a cigarette which it occasionally smokes.

SCP-7699 works as a lawyer but has shown a tendency to act impulsively and take risks. This often results in humorous situations, such as jumping off a cliff into a lake or river.

SCP-7699 has expressed feelings of anxiety and loneliness, often seeking the company of others to distract from these emotions. When agitated, SCP-7699 has shown signs of aggression, but has been shown to respond well to positive reinforcement.

SCP-7699's anomalous properties are still being studied, but it has shown no signs of causing any harm to humans, and may be beneficial in certain legal situations.

Addendum: SCP-7699 has requested an adjustment in its containment protocol to allow for a small garden to be added to its containment chamber. This request is currently under review by Level 2 personnel.
