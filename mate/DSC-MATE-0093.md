Item #: 93

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 93 is to be monitored at all times during work hours, and any interactions with customers must be reviewed by a Foundation agent. He is to be treated with caution as he possesses strong empathic abilities that can affect those around him.

Description: Subject is a male humanoid of the species human, aged early twenties. He wears a hoodie that conceals his head, except for his ski goggles that cover his eyes. His face features a constant smile, and he is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck and smoking a cigarette.

Personality: Subject exhibits a remarkable level of empathy, which makes him the ideal candidate for his job as a fast food worker. He can quickly read the emotions of others and provide them with the appropriate words of comfort or humor, often brightening their day. However, this empathy can be distressing to others, as it can lead to an almost overwhelming level of emotional intensity. Subject 93 has endeavored to control his abilities and use them for the betterment of others. 

Addendum: Subject 93 has exhibited a degree of mental fortitude, permitting him to resist most forms of mind-altering magic, but his empathic abilities remain vulnerable to manipulation. Use of specific speech patterns or pheromone-based products is strictly forbidden during any interactions with Subject 93. Any instances of non-compliance should be immediately reported to the nearest agent for further assessment.
