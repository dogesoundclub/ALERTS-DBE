Item #: SCP-945

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-945 is to be contained within a designated personnel break room at Site-██. Under no circumstances should SCP-945 be permitted access to any form of technology or internet-capable devices.

Description: SCP-945 appears to be an individual of the human species, identified as a male fast food worker. Physical features include orange stripes across the face, as well as green cross earrings and a silver chain. SCP-945 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset and nerd glasses.

SCP-945 possesses an extraordinary level of analytical and logical thought processes. They have been known to engage in debates and arguments with others for sheer enjoyment, often delving into seemingly trivial or unimportant topics.

The use of technology or internet-capable devices has been discovered to have adverse effects on SCP-945's cognitive abilities, leading to a decrease in analytical thought and an increase in emotional volatility.

Despite SCP-945's seemingly harmless nature, it is important to restrict access to technology and internet-capable devices, as the potential danger this SCP poses when exposed to such technology cannot be understated.
