SCP-4116 is a peculiar human being, designated as a Real Estate Agent for their mundane role in society. However, their anomalous appearance surely sets them apart from others. SCP-4116 exhibits a prominent mouth spot, resembling a heightened melanin deposition on their lips, giving the impression of a speckly pout. 

Moving along to their eyes, SCP-4116 brands a glance of blue clown eyes, possessed by an intense presence of luster, that establishes them as truly inquisitive, yet slightly intimidating. The display of blue coloration is not a natural occurrence and is subject to further research. Notably, SCP-4116 wears a medical mask as a mouthpiece, the reasons for which are currently unknown. 

Moreover, they don a gold earring and a gold chain as additional accessories. These adornments have yielded no anomalous effects but provide SCP-4116 with an added sense of glamour. Although, it is essential to note that gold is often related to paranormal activities, which cannot be ruled out for SCP-4116. 

Their personality traits are unique in the way that they bring forth an overwhelming thirst for knowledge. They constantly lap up information from various sources, ranging from books, documentaries, to obscure topics. SCP-4116 is fervent about sharing their erudition with others, often indulging in prolonged discourse. It is also worth pointing out that they tend to get fixated on specific subjects, concentrating on them tirelessly. Nevertheless, SCP- 4116 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, as they acutely portray an enhanced ability to gather intelligence.
