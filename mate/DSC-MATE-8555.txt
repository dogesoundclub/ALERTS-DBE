Item #: SCP-8555

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8555 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber on Site-██. As SCP-8555 is not known to posses any anomalous abilities or threat to personnel, no additional security measures are required. Access to SCP-8555's chamber is authorized for Class D personnel who are cleared and supervised for interview purposes only.

Description: SCP-8555 is a human female of average build, standing at 170cm tall with metal blue hair and orange eyebrows. Their ears contain jade earrings, and they wear a silver chain as an accessory. SCP-8555's face features a pleasant smile, and their forehead exhibits a two-color band. SCP-8555 is identified as a banker in the general public.

Personality-wise, SCP-8555 is keenly observant and attentive to details, primarily when it comes to gift-giving. While this makes SCP-8555 an excellent gift-giver, they often become concerned with finding the "perfect" gift and spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over it.

SCP-8555 was introduced to the Foundation's attention during a routine investigation into financial transactions traced from a known anomalous entity. During interrogation, SCP-8555 showed no signs of knowledge of anomalous activity or items.

Addendum: Despite SCP-8555's lack of anomalous abilities, their attention to detail and exceeding care to ensure complete customer satisfaction are valuable to Foundation operations. The Director of Site-██ has approved the assignment of SCP-8555 as a finance officer for the Department of Containment.
