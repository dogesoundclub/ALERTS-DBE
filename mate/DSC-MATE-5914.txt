SCP-5914's personality is laid-back and easy-going. They are fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones, which can lead to some humorous situations such as getting into heated arguments with someone who insults a friend or family member. SCP-5914 socializes well with other SCPs and has manifested a close relationship with SCP-2337.

SCP-5914 is a train driver and is capable of operating various kinds of locomotives. They are experienced with navigating through various terrains and hazardous environments.

Addendum 5914-2: Incident Report 5914-A

On [REDACTED], SCP-5914 displayed highly destructive anomalous abilities after experiencing emotional distress brought about by the death of a family member.
