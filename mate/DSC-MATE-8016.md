Special Containment Procedures: Due to their status as a prominent figure within the criminal underworld, DSC-MATE-8016 is monitored under constant surveillance by Foundation agents. However, direct intervention is to be avoided as much as possible, as the risk of exposing the Foundation's existence to the civilian population is deemed too high.

Description: DSC-MATE-8016 is a human female of Italian descent, commonly known as "The Orange Lady" among members of the criminal underworld. They are the leader of an organised crime syndicate and hold significant power and influence within their community.

DSC-MATE-8016 possesses a unique set of physical features, including noticeable spots on their face and a head of orange hair, which is often styled in a distinctive sidecut. Their eyes are equipped with VR technology and display a constantly rotating rainbow LED pattern. DSC-MATE-8016 is often seen wearing gold earrings and a silver chain, which is believed to be a talisman or good luck charm of some kind.

Despite their ruthless reputation within the criminal underworld, DSC-MATE-8016 possesses a deep sense of empathy and understanding for others, particularly those suffering from pain or hardship. They are known to be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when confronted with the pain of others, indicating a potential degree of psychological stress or vulnerability.

DSC-MATE-8016 also displays a fondness for nature and animals, with several reports indicating that they have been known to donate large sums of money to various animal charities and conservation efforts.
