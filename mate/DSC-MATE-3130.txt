Description: SCP-3130 is a human female of blonde hair and possessing an artificial wing attached to their head. The wing has proven capable of limited flight and control of air currents. Their facial features include various spots scattered around their cheeks, and a prominent medical mask covering their mouth. The mask has been observed to be worn for prolonged periods, even when not necessary.

Of particular interest are their VR Rainbow LED eyes, capable of displaying an array of colors and patterns. The cause of such an abnormality is unexplained. Their forehead is adorned with goggles, which they may lower at will to access visual data on their surroundings. They frequently wear a choker around their neck and a gold earring on each ear.

SCP-3130 displays an acute emotional attunement, commonly displaying sentimentality towards art, music, and visual media. Such displays may include a strong emotional response or the shedding of tears. Their passion for art and music has shown to influence 3130's insight when repairing mechanical systems, leading to a better understanding of the devices' design.

Addendum: Personal insight has shown that 3130's medical mask is a result of a past incident involving a near-death experience due to an airborne medical condition. An investigation into their medical records has shown the incident to originate from a past containment breach that 3130 was involved in. No further information on this incident is available.
