Description: SCP-2718 is a male rabbit of the genus Oryctolagus cuniculus, standing at approximately 45 centimeters in height. SCP-2718 possesses an unusual jade earring on its right ear as well as a red scarf around its neck. In addition, SCP-2718 wears a standard issue gas mask at all times, regardless of the environment. Despite this, SCP-2718 exhibits no modification of its breathing pattern or any other attributing factor that would imply an increased need for oxygen. It is speculated that SCP-2718 wears the mask for aesthetic purposes.

Personality: SCP-2718 is highly empathetic and in tune with its emotions, frequently becoming emotional over fictional scenarios in movies or TV shows. It is also noted that SCP-2718 has a fondness for music and art that commonly trigger strong emotions. Personnel have observed that SCP-2718's emotional reactions can create a sort of empathetic feedback loop that amplifies emotional reactions in those in proximity.

After pursuit, SCP-2718 was apprehended and subsequently transferred into Foundation custody. At present, SCP-2718 poses no threat and appears to be entirely cooperative with the Foundation's containment procedures.
