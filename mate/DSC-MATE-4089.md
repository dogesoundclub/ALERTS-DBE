Item #: 4089

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Agent 4089 is to be monitored by Foundation Personnel to ensure normalcy in his daily routines. Should any anomalous activity be reported, it is to be immediately reported to the nearest Foundation facility for further evaluation.

Description: Agent 4089 is a male human employed as a Traffic Officer in the (Redacted) Department. His eyes, much like ski goggles, are a bright blue and surround his eyes to protect them. His parted pink hair is styled and combed to the right. On his forehead, he wears a translucent goggle with magnification lenses that is used in accident sites to evaluate evidence clearly. Agent 4089 has a pair of green cross-shaped earrings, which he claims provide him with luck and good fortune. He is often seen wearing a red scarf, which he says reminds him of his beloved grandmother.

Agent 4089 is known for his nurturing and compassionate nature. He is often seen helping his colleagues and caring for them as a father would do for his children. Several incidents have been reported where Agent 4089 takes an active role in serving the community by providing a listening ear and helping solve their problems. His caring nature has also been the reason behind several humorous incidents where he treats his colleagues as if they are his own children, much to their amusement and bewilderment.

Addendum: Agent 4089 came to the Foundation's attention after a series of reports were filed regarding his unusual behavior towards colleagues and members of the public. Further evaluations are currently ongoing to determine if Agent 4089 poses a potential security threat to the Foundation's objectives.
