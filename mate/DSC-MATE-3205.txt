SCP-3205 is a humanoid individual, appearing to be a middle-aged male with spots scattered upon their face. The most notable feature of SCP-3205's face is their mouth, which remains perpetually open in a scared, gaping expression. SCP-3205's head is that of a bald monk, with a shaved scalp and peaceful countenance. While seemingly contradictory, the combination of the monk head and frightened mouth has led to a disquieting effect on those who interact with SCP-3205.

SCP-3205 wears a jade earring in their right ear, and a medical mask covers their mouth. Additionally, they are often found wearing a red scarf around their neck, though the origin or purpose of this accessory is as of yet unknown.

SCP-3205 is a lawyer by trade, but their interest extends far beyond the realm of legal proceedings. SCP-3205 has an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and will often spend hours researching obscure topics or collecting educational materials such as books or documentaries. They are passionate about sharing this newfound knowledge with others and can be quite persuasive in their efforts to educate those around them.

While SCP-3205's motives may appear benign, caution is advised in dealing with them. Their combination of monk-like serenity and fearful expression may hide a darker side, and their desire to collect and share knowledge may have unforeseen consequences. As with all SCPs, further observation and study is necessary to fully understand the nature of SCP-3205's abilities and effects.
