Item #: SCP-8024

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8024 is currently contained in a reinforced steel enclosure located at Site-██. The enclosure is outfitted with multiple layers of electrified fencing and enhanced surveillance equipment to discourage escape attempts. Staff are advised to only approach SCP-8024 when wearing full body protection and carrying a tranquilizer gun.

Description:

SCP-8024 is a male Bengal tiger with distinctive red clown eyes. The subject exhibits an anomalous ability to wear a purple cap with a headset that remains firmly attached to his head, regardless of physical movement or attempts to remove it. The reason for this has not yet been discovered.

Despite exhibiting a calm demeanor, SCP-8024 has a strong sense of independence and is known to exhibit extreme aggression towards anyone he perceives as trying to control him. Any attempts to manipulate or control SCP-8024 will result in violent outbursts that have been known to cause significant property damage and injury.

It is believed that SCP-8024 was once a normal tiger that was exposed to a powerful magical artifact, causing the subject to develop an array of destructive abilities. These abilities include high-speed reflexes, enhanced strength, and regenerative properties that allow SCP-8024 to recover from injuries that would be fatal to a normal tiger.

SCP-8024 is classified as a Keter-level threat due to its incredible strength, nearly impenetrable hide, and the unpredictable nature of its behavior.

Personality:

SCP-8024 is fiercely independent and resists any attempts at control or manipulation. The subject has been observed engaging in rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of containment or taking days off without permission. However, if he perceives someone as an ally, SCP-8024 can be surprisingly loyal and protective.

SCP-8024's personality traits make it difficult to predict his actions or intentions, which makes it all the more important for staff to be cautious when interacting with the subject.

Addendum:

Due to the subject's difficulty in containment, researchers are currently exploring various methods of controlling or otherwise neutralizing SCP-8024. However, with his regenerative properties and innate strength, this may prove to be a difficult task. As for now, all staff members are advised to keep safety their top priority.
