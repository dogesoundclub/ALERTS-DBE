The subject's head is covered by a hoodie, under which large ears and buck teeth are visible. The rabbit always wears a red scarf around their neck as an accessory. DSC-MATE-6519 has been documented to have a tendency to shed at an unusually high rate, leading to complications on a quarantine level.

Personality: DSC-MATE-6519 is a Real Estate Agent by profession, and while they can be quite charming while interacting with clients, they tend to be forgetful and absent-minded. They are prone to getting lost in thought or absorbed in a project, leading to a comedic situation when they end up missing appointments or failing to keep track of time.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6519 has been diagnosed with a severe case of dissociative identity disorder, leading to unpredictable behavior during mood swings.
