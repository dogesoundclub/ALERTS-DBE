Item #: 7334

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7334 is to be contained within standard personnel quarters at Site-██. SCP-7334 is not to enter any theater or any location known for its loud, chaotic environment. Access to SCP-7334 must be approved by a Level 3 Security Clearance.

Description: SCP-7334 is a middle-aged human female who works as a theater manager. SCP-7334 has several unique physical features, including spots, a smile, blue clown eyes, and 90s brown hair. The subject has a two-color band on their forehead, and their ears are adorned with green cross earrings. SCP-7334 regularly wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask as their preferred accessories.

SCP-7334 has displayed an obsessive and detail-oriented personality, often alphabetizing their spice rack and color-coding their closet. The subject's condition defines their work ethic, as they strive to maintain the theater in exemplary condition, much to the delight of performers and theater-goers alike.

SCP-7334's LED gas mask has unique properties that allow it to filter out loud or chaotic sounds from the environment. This mask also provides an easier method of communication for SCP-7334 as they are more comfortable communicating through a voice changer than through their natural voice. SCP-7334 has reported discomfort and anxiety when exposed to loud or chaotic environments, and as a result, it is advised to keep them away from such situations.

SCP-7334 is fully cooperative with the Foundation and has been willing to comply with all instructions thus far. No anomalous activities have been reported outside of SCP-7334's behavior, and the subject is deemed manageable with the proper precautions.

Notes: SCP-7334's abnormal behavior must be monitored to ensure that they do not escalate to any dangerous level. It may be necessary to give the subject different assignments that are better suited to their condition in the future.
