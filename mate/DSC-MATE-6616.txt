Item #: SCP-6616

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6616 is to be provided with a secured delivery vehicle for its work as a delivery driver. The vehicle must be equipped with a GPS tracking system to monitor its locations at all times. SCP-6616 should be allowed to complete its delivery tasks uninterrupted, as it poses no threat to personnel.

Description: SCP-6616 is a male monkey of the Macaca fascicularis species, standing at 1.2 meters tall. It wears a purple cap and a headset while working. Its mouth is perpetually in a frightened expression, and it wears normal glasses. SCP-6616's forehead features a two-color band, and has a jade earring on each ear. It is known to wear a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-6616 is a delivery driver that has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. It often takes on more work than it can handle, leading to some humorous situations. SCP-6616 is capable of carrying multiple packages at once, despite its size. However, it can become overwhelmed and have difficulty completing all of its tasks in a single day.

SCP-6616 has exhibited no anomalous behavior or abilities, other than its ability to multitask and adapt to different environments. Its species is known for its high intelligence and problem-solving skills, which may explain its ability to handle multiple tasks efficiently.

Addendum: SCP-6616 has been observed exhibiting cooperative behavior with other SCPs, particularly those that require delivery of items or packages. It has been recommended that SCP-6616 be utilized for such tasks in the future.
