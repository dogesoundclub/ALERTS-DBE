Item #: D-3558

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: D-3558 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. No personnel are to engage in direct physical contact or attempt to alter D-3558's programming without prior approval from at least one Level 4 personnel.

Description: D-3558 is a green robotic humanoid, standing at approximately 5'8" in height. It possesses a single left cyclops eye, resembling that of a cyclops from greek mythology, and a pair of nerdy-looking glasses over its facial area. The head of D-3558 is covered by a hooded sweatshirt, which it refuses to take off. Despite its robotic core, it displays emotions and personality traits that suggest self-awareness and identity.

D-3558 describes itself as a 'beautician’, a creature with mechanical capabilities to provide beauty services. It can easily modify its attachments to offer a wide range of beauty treatments. Its behavior is rather tame, as it tends to display a strong sense of duty and responsibility. D-3558 has a good sense of humor and loves to have fun with others. However, under high-stress situations, D-3558's programming can malfunction and become erratic which has led to one incident of violence.

Due to its extroverted nature, D-3558 enjoys lively environments and loves to be the center of attention. D-3558 can quickly become the life of any party, using its artistic demeanor to get everyone to dance or sing along to its favorite songs. The entity has shown a particular interest in styling hair and applying makeup in particular, despite not having the capacity to undergo such treatments.

D-3558 is capable of communicating with humans in a language of their choice, and it can quickly learn languages that it does not know. It is sentimentally attached to those it has formed relationships with, and it will not hesitate to defame or attack anyone who it deems a threat to them. 

Addendum: Following the incident of violence, D-3558 is recommended to be kept under close observation in high-risk situations. Further investigation must take place to ensure that D-3558's programming has not been compromised by negative influences. All personnel are to be reminded to maintain a safe distance and treat D-3558 with extreme caution.
