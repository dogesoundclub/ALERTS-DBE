Item #: 3306

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3306 is to be kept in a maximum-security facility at all times. All personnel assigned to observe or communicate with 3306 must be cleared beforehand by Foundation staff. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and notify the proper personnel. Any unauthorized entry into 3306's containment area will be met with lethal force.

Description: 3306 is a human female with distinct features that set them apart from other humans. Their lips are always adorned with red lipstick, and their eyebrows are a bright orange color. The side of their head is also an orange hue, and they wear red cross earrings in their ears. Though they appear human, they possess a natural curiosity about the world that is uncommon in most people. They are known to randomly spout off obscure facts and trivia to others, whether they are interested or not.

Personality: 3306 is a villain with an insatiable curiosity about the world. They can come across as playful and friendly when first encountered, which is deceptive due to the ruthless and destructive nature of their villainy. They often take on obscure or unusual topics as projects, delving into every aspect of the subject until they have an encyclopedic knowledge about it. They are often prone to boredom and may engage in dangerous and destructive behavior as a result. 

Additional Notes: All attempts to rehabilitate 3306 have been unsuccessful. They are exceptionally intelligent and manipulative, making them a major threat to the Foundation and the general public. Their continued containment is of utmost importance. Any personnel assigned to interacting with 3306 must remain vigilant at all times and avoid engaging in needless conversation or banter, as it is known to be one of their tactics for extracting information or devising a means of escape.
