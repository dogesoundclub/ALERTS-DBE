Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1651 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Interaction with DSC-MATE-1651 is limited to designated personnel with level 2 clearance or higher. DSC-MATE-1651 is allowed to continue her profession as a real estate agent under the condition that she does not use any anomalous abilities or substances.

Description: DSC-MATE-1651 is a human female in her mid-30s with distinctive facial features. She has a series of black spots on her face, with purple lipstick that complements her 90s-style brown hair. Her forehead has a two-color band and a pair of goggles resting on top. She is often seen wearing a choker around her neck.

DSC-MATE-1651 exhibits a strong inclination for detail-orientation to the point of being obsessive. This trait is manifested most notably in her gift-giving habits, where she puts an excessive amount of time and effort into finding the perfect present for her intended recipient. She also possesses heightened observational skills, which contributes to her ability to read human behavior and provide detailed analysis.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1651 has been a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in investigating objects and individuals with anomalous properties. But we must be cautious regarding her obsession with perfection as it can be a weakness that can be exploited. Therefore, full psychological evaluations and assessments are required at regular intervals to ensure that DSC-MATE-1651 does not lose her mental composure.
