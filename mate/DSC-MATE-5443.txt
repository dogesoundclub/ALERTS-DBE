Interview Logs:

Researcher ██████████: Good morning, SCP-5443. How are you feeling today?

SCP-5443: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.

Researcher ██████████: Can you tell me a bit about yourself? What made you become a traffic officer?

SCP-5443: Well, I've always been interested in the law and upholding it. Plus, I like the idea of keeping people safe on the road. It's just something I feel passionate about.

Researcher ██████████: You seem to exhibit a strong sense of independence. Can you tell me more about that?

SCP-5443: Yeah, I don't like relying on other people for things. I prefer to do things on my own, no matter how hard it may be.

Researcher ██████████: That's understandable. However, have you ever encountered a situation where you needed help but didn't want to ask for it?

SCP-5443: Well, there was this one time where I had to move this big bookshelf by myself, and it was a struggle. But I just couldn't bring myself to ask for help.

Researcher ██████████: Have you learned anything from situations like that?

SCP-5443: Yeah, I think I've learned that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. I mean, no one can do everything alone, right?

Researcher's Note: SCP-5443 seems to be relatively open to conversation and exhibits no signs of malice or hostility. It may be useful to perform further testing to learn more about their abilities and how they operate.
