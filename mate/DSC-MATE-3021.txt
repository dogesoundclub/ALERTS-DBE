Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3021 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber suitable for primate species. SCP-3021 is to be fed and watered daily, and provided with toys and entertainment to maintain its mental state. It must receive regular medical check-ups from a qualified veterinarian.

Description: SCP-3021 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca. SCP-3021 is 50 cm in height, weighed around 5 kg, and has features including but not limited to: Blue clown eyes, Purple cap with a headset, and a frightened mouth. SCP-3021 possesses human-level intelligence, and computer programming knowledge beyond what should be possible for its species. However, SCP-3021 is prone to panic attacks, and can be troublesome when presented with unforeseen circumstances. 

SCP-3021 is capable of speech but prefers to communicate through computer code. He engages in various computer activities such as gaming and programming, but it must be noted that he is not to be granted access to any networks or computer systems beyond that which is specified by the foundation. SCP-3021 has garnered high marks for reliability and organizes all his activities through the use of spreadsheets. While being an amicable personality in general, SCP-3021 is often hesitant when presented with new situations and may be unwilling to change established routines.

Addendum: After a containment breach in which SCP-3021 accessed and manipulated Foundation systems, SCP-3021 was re-classified from Safe to Euclid. It is paramount that personnel protect information on their own profiles as SCP-3021 has the capability to learn and understand Foundation protocol. Any attempts at breaching security or causing damage to the Foundation will result in immediate termination.
