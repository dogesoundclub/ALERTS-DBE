SCP-2532, also known as the "Code Monkey", is a male monkey of unknown origin that currently works as a programmer at [REDACTED]. The subject is easily identified by its frightened mouth and unnerving red clown eyes, which give it an eerie appearance.

Despite its odd appearance, 2532 is a highly skilled coder with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This often results in the subject taking on more than it can handle â€“ attempting to complete an impossible amount of work in a single day or trying to carry too many things at once.

2532 is rarely seen without a cigarette in hand, which it claims helps it focus and reduces its anxiety levels. However, due to its monkey physiology, the subject is unable to smoke the cigarettes conventionally and instead ignites them with its own body heat.

Given its talent and dedication to its job, 2532 has become invaluable to the team at [REDACTED]. However, its unusual appearance and habits have caused some discomfort among its coworkers, and precautions must be taken to ensure the subject's safety and well-being.
