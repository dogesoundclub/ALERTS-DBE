SCP-6896, also known as "The Programmer", is a human female of average height and build. Her most notable feature is the VR Jade LED eyes that glint like orbs of green light, almost as though they are connected to some otherworldly power source. The top of her head is a bright orange color that seems to clash with the rest of her outfit, which consists of a simple black t-shirt and denim jeans.

SCP-6896 is never seen without her goggles, which she wears casually on her forehead. She also wears a plain black choker around her neck as an additional accessory.

Despite her mundane profession as a programmer, SCP-6896 possesses a remarkable sense of humor that endears her to those around her. She enjoys making others laugh, often using funny stories and silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Her lighthearted nature can sometimes lead her into trouble, as she has been known to make excessive jokes in inappropriate situations.

It is important to note that SCP-6896 should not be underestimated due to her humoristic nature. She is fully capable of utilizing her programming abilities to their full extent, often completing complex tasks with ease. It is advised to treat her with respect and caution, as her true potential may not be apparent on the surface.
