SCP-7355, also known as "The Empathetic Delivery Driver", is a human male with striking orange stripes on his otherwise ordinary face. He maintains a low profile by donning a hoodie, nerd glasses, a gold chain and keeping a cigarette on hand at all times. Do not be fooled by his benign appearance, as SCP-7355 harbors a powerful ability to sense and understand the emotions of those around him, often to the point of being able to predict their actions.

Despite his peculiar trait, SCP-7355 is otherwise unremarkable in terms of anomalous attributes. However, his empathetic nature can often lead to situations that require Foundation intervention, as he will go to great lengths to help those in need, even if it means breaking protocol. This behavior can either prove problematic or advantageous depending on the context.

SCP-7355's profession as a delivery driver may seem mundane, but it actually allows him to use his power effectively. He often delivers packages to those in distress, providing comfort and much-needed emotional support. His ability to read body language and facial expressions also helps him to be a more efficient driver, avoiding dangerous situations before they arise.

Overall, SCP-7355 is a valuable member of the Foundation's urban fantasy division, often working as a liaison between abnormal and human populations. Though his empathetic nature can cause occasional friction, he is a valuable asset that should not be underestimated.
