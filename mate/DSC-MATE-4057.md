Item #: DSC-MATE-4057

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4057 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Its access to the internet is to be monitored, and any attempts to communicate with non-Foundation personnel are to be intercepted and neutralized. Any attempt at escape is to be met with force.

Description: DSC-MATE-4057 is a monkey of the Pongo genus, standing at approximately 4 feet tall. Its most distinguishing feature is its eyes, which are a shade of red not found in any primate species known to the Foundation. It wears a red beanie on its head, a red scarf around its neck, and an LED gas mask which it refuses to remove.

DSC-MATE-4057 demonstrates advanced knowledge of computer programming and can operate with exceptional speed and efficiency. This proficiency in organization and delegation, combined with its tendency towards controlling behavior, has led to a peculiar set of behavioral patterns. It is known to take charge of group projects or events and will delegate tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way, sometimes to the point of irritation for those around it.

Interaction with DSC-MATE-4057 has been known to cause feelings of anxiety and unease in individuals who are not familiar with its conduct. Its personality quirks and eccentric preferences make it a difficult subject to comprehend or predict.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4057 attempted to escape its containment facility, indicating that it was in search of a "perfect code" that would "unlock the secrets of the universe". The escape attempt was thwarted without the use of force, and DSC-MATE-4057 was reprimanded accordingly. Further monitoring of its internet access is required.
