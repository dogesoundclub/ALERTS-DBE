Item #: 280

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 280 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times, with daily welfare checks and regular psychological evaluations. Any attempts by subject 280 to escape or cause harm must be immediately reported to the nearest supervisor.

Description: Subject 280 appears to be a female human of unknown age, with distinctive spots on her face and an ever-present edgy, green hairstyle. The subject may be recognized by her wide smile and peculiar goggles perched on her forehead. The eyes are obscured by normal glasses, preventing any ocular abnormalities. A two-color band on her forehead is clearly visible, though its purpose is unknown.

Personality: Subject 280 exhibits symptoms of scatterbrainedness, including but not limited to extreme forgetfulness and frequent delusions. This excessive confusion has led to various comical situations that the subject seems to take pleasure in. While this behavior may seem endearing, it should be noted that it can become a serious problem, especially when important appointments or objectives must be met.

Despite the erratic behavior and cognitive impairment, subject 280 should be regarded with caution as she is known for having a villainous attitude. Her previous criminal activities have included stealing from various wealthy clients, bombing public places, and selling illegal substances. It is believed that the subject may be affiliated with several criminal organizations and must not be trusted.

Further investigation into the nature and origin of the subject and her forehead features is strongly advised.
