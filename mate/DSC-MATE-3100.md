Item #: 3100

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3100, also known as the "Reporter" must be monitored at all times due to their unique appearance and behavior. They are to be shadowed by a Foundation operative at all times when interacting with individuals outside the containment facility. Any information gathered by 3100 must be screened by the Foundation before it can be disseminated to the public.

Description: Subject 3100 is a male humanoid with a distinctive appearance. They sport a mohawk atop their head, and their eyes are covered by ski goggles with a secondary set resting on their forehead. A green cross earring dangles from their left ear, and they can often be seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a cigarette.

Personality: 3100 can come across as bossy, but their strong and decisive nature is essential to their profession as a reporter. They demand efficiency and effectiveness from themselves and those around them. While their temperament may be intimidating, it's all in the name of getting the job done.

Additional Notes: The Foundation values the information-gathering skills of 3100, but we must remain vigilant in preventing any potential breaches of secrecy or exposure of anomalous activity.
