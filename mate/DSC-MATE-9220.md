Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #9220 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. The subject must be allowed to carry out assigned tasks but is not to be given access to any objects that could be used for unconventional repair methods.

Description: Item #9220 is a male human police officer in his mid-thirties. The subject wears a police cap and has a red scarf wrapped around his neck. His mouth is covered by a medical mask, and he has a distinctive mouth spot on his chin. The subject has ski goggle-like eyes, which have been observed to change colors based on his mood.

Item #9220 tends to be very practical and hands-on, often fixing things in unconventional ways. The subject frequently uses duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects and rig up makeshift solutions to problems. While this has been observed to be successful in some cases, it is often inappropriate and can lead to dangerous situations.

The subject also has a unique smile that can be disarming to those around him. He has demonstrated a genuine interest in helping others and is determined to solve cases, often going above and beyond what would be expected of a normal police officer.

Personnel are reminded to exercise caution when working with Item #9220, as his unconventional methods can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. Medical personnel should be on standby in case of any injuries that may arise from these methods.

Addendum: Item #9220 has demonstrated an ability to resist anomalous effects, making him a valuable asset in certain situations. Research into the subject's unique abilities is ongoing.
