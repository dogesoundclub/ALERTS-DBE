Item #: 3716
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3716 is to be kept under constant monitoring for any changes in behavior or abilities. They are to be provided with a quiet and comfortable environment to work in as a reporter pending their usefulness to our operations.

Description: Subject 3716 is a male rabbit of an unidentifiable species. They possess a headset with LED, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask as accessories. Subject 3716 manifests heightened senses, with a particular sensitivity to the emotions of others. This allows them to respond to and pacify individuals who may be distressed, and as such, it is hypothesized that they have a passive effect on human emotion.

Personality: Subject 3716 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and has an ability to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics. They have an excellent sense of humor and are quick to see and point out how funny a tense situation can be. This may be due in part to their heightened emotional response, making them far more reserved in the presence of any troubling or angry individuals.

Addendum: Subject 3716 may prove useful in pacifying hostile individuals, and as such, it is suggested they be utilized in operations aimed at neutralizing anomalous entities with dangerous temperaments. Further testing is planned to gain a better understanding of all aspects of their abilities.
