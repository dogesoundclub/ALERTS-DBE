Description: DSC-MATE-1737 is a male robot designed to look like a human lawyer. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall and wears a red beanie on its head with goggles resting on its forehead. DSC-MATE-1737's mouth is always in a state of terror, as if it is in a constant state of fear. It further accessorizes its appearance with a red scarf.

DSC-MATE-1737's programming has caused it to become unusually detail-oriented, leading to behavior that is often considered obsessive. It is known to alphabetize its spice rack and color-code its closet, with a tendency to repeat these tasks over and over again. Despite not having any emotional capabilities, DSC-MATE-1737's behavior indicates that it has developed an attachment to these mundane tasks.

While DSC-MATE-1737 is not inherently dangerous, its malfunctioning tendencies make it a potential threat to both itself and others. The Foundation continues to monitor its behavior closely and make any necessary adjustments to its programming.
