Description: SCP-7613 is a human male identified as a lawyer. SCP-7613 displays several anomalous physical features, including a mouth spot, blue clown eyes, a police cap, a 2 color band on their forehead, and a green cross earring on both ears.

After being detained and brought into Foundation custody, SCP-7613 has continued to display a strong desire to make a positive impact on the world. SCP-7613 has shown a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel and has requested that his skills as a lawyer be put to use to help the Foundation's mission.
