Subject 2086 appears to be a human female with a unique appearance. Their face is adorned with spots, and their eyes have been surgically altered to resemble those of a clown, with a vibrant blue color that is unsettling to most observers. A tiara is worn on their head, adding a regal touch to their appearance. Most striking, however, is the two-color band on their forehead - the significance of which remains unclear.

This subject is often seen wearing a gold chain, which shimmers under the light, and matching earrings. They are rarely seen without their trademark cigarette, which they smoke with a nonchalant attitude. This suggests a level of confidence that borders on arrogance.

Though their appearance is noteworthy, it is their personality that truly sets them apart. Subject 2086 possesses a strong sense of intuition, which occasionally manifests as precognition, giving the impression that they possess psychic powers. They can often predict outcomes before they unfold or sense when someone is upset, anxious, or trying to deceive them.

As a politician, they are a master manipulator, charming and cunning in their dealings with others. However, their overall demeanor can be described as being detached, almost robotic, and somewhat unsettling.

Further research is needed to determine the nature of their abilities and how they might be utilized in the field of urban fantasy, but it is clear that subject 2086 is not to be underestimated.
