Item #: SCP-4366

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4366 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, decorated to the subject's liking within the limits of safety. No SCP personnel without Level 3 clearance may interact with 4366 without being under the supervision of at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-4366 appears to be a humanoid male, standing at a height of 1.79 meters with a slim build. SCP-4366's most notable physical trait are the orange stripes that run across his face. His eyes are red and he constantly wears a red scarf around his neck. On his head, he wears a retro cap, and a green cross earring on each ear.

SCP-4366 is a fashion designer by trade and owns his own clothing company. He prides himself on his charismatic personality and ability to connect with others. SCP-4366 uses his exceptional charm and wit to disarm others, frequently encouraging others to tell him their life stories, hopes and dreams.

SCP-4366 is capable of both intentional and unintentional influence over individuals he comes into contact with. This trait makes him particularly dangerous, as he has been known to charm people into divulging classified information, and/or entice them to perform actions that go against their normal behavior. Research has also indicated that SCP-4366 can cause intense feelings of euphoria and happiness in individuals, which may lead to addictive behavior.

Addendum:

SCP-4366 has been observed to behave well within containment, frequently expressing a desire to expand his wardrobe and assisting with designing clothes for other humanoid SCPs. However, SCP-4366 has been known to become upset when refused access to certain materials or denied interaction with other SCPs to show off his latest designs. The situation has been carefully monitored, and personnel are advised to avoid interactions that may irritate the SCP.
