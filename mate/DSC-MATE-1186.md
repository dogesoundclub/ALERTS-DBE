Description: Subject 1186 is a male human, identified as a veterinarian by trade. His most notable physical features include spots on his face and a bright, infectious smile that seems to put all who meet him at ease. He typically dons a pair of nerd glasses and sports a head of normal blonde hair, with a two-color band visible on his forehead.

In addition to his casual, yet professional appearance, 1186 wears a normal gas mask as an accessory. While the reason for this is unknown, it is believed that this may be a personal choice based on his profession.

Although 1186's demeanor is typically calm and collected, he exhibits a very caring and nurturing personality. He is known to go above and beyond to take care of his friends and family, often treating them like his own children. While this can lead to humorous situations at times, his overall kindness and compassion have made him a valued member of his community.

Should 1186 exhibit any behavior that deviates from his current personality traits, he is to be immediately detained and placed under observation until further analysis can be conducted.
