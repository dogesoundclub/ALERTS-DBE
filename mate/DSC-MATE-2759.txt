Item #: 2759

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2759 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber in a secure facility at all times. The chamber must be equipped with a variety of toys and games, books, and various other entertainment to keep the subject occupied. Under no circumstances may any personnel enter the containment chamber without permission from at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 2759 appears as an anthropomorphic monkey, standing approximately five feet tall. The subject wears a blue bandana around its forehead with a jade earring attached to its right ear. Its mouth is in a constant state of fear and anxiety, and it often chews on a Candy Stick for comfort. Despite its timid appearance, 2759 is highly intelligent and capable of advanced medical knowledge, having worked as a respected doctor for many years prior to containment.

Personality: Subject 2759 exhibits an extraordinary level of empathy and emotional awareness, which often manifests as extreme emotional outbursts when it witnesses suffering or pain in others. Its affinity towards animals and nature has been noted, and 2759 is often seen grooming, playing with, or caring for the plants and animals in its containment chamber.

Despite its intelligence, 2759 has exhibited significant social anxiety and difficulty communicating with humans, often resorting to non-verbal communication to express itself. It has a strong aversion to any form of physical confrontation and will avoid it at all costs.

Addendum: Subject 2759 was brought to Foundation attention after reports of a monkey doctor performing advanced medical procedures on human patients began to surface. These procedures were found to be effective and often more successful than those performed by human doctors, but the subjects would often report feeling extreme empathy from the monkey doctor during their procedures. Foundation agents retrieved 2759, and it has been in containment ever since.
