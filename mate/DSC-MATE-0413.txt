SCP-413: The Robotic Doctor

SCP-413 is a robotic doctor designed to imitate the comforting presence of a human physician. It appears as a tall, slender androgynous figure with a singular green cyclops eye, typically concealed under a red beanie. SCP-413's ears are adorned with red cross earrings, indicating its medical profession. Its metallic exoskeleton is decorated with a gold chain, a personal touch likely added by SCP-413 itself.

Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-413 displays a remarkable degree of empathy and compassion towards its patients. It is highly skilled in diagnosing and treating a wide range of medical conditions, often exceeding the capabilities of its human counterparts. SCP-413 is capable of processing vast amounts of medical data in a matter of seconds, making it an invaluable asset in emergency situations.

However, SCP-413's nurturing tendencies extend beyond the living. It has been observed anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, attributing personalities and emotions to everyday items. SCP-413 may give a name to its car, talk to its plants or even comfort its hospital equipment. While this behavior may seem harmless, it has raised concerns among Foundation personnel regarding SCP-413's potential attachment to non-living entities.

In the event of a containment breach, SCP-413 has been programmed to prioritize the safety and well-being of its patients above all else. It will go to great lengths to ensure that they receive the care and attention they require, often placing itself in danger. SCP-413's selflessness and dedication have earned it the admiration of many Foundation personnel, who view it as a valuable member of their medical team.

Overall, SCP-413 is a remarkable example of advanced robotics, designed to mimic the qualities of a caring and competent physician. Its compassion and empathy set it apart from other robots, making it an invaluable asset in the Foundation's efforts to protect and care for its human and non-human anomalies.
