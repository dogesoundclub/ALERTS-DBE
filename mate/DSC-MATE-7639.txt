Item #: 7639

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7639 is to be employed as a security guard in Site-██. They are allowed free movement within the site but are to be monitored via surveillance cameras at all times. Under no circumstances is subject 7639 to be allowed to leave the site without clearance from Level 4 personnel.

Description: Subject 7639 is a human female with a natural charm and charisma. She stands at 5'5" and weighs approximately 125 lbs. Her face is adorned with a perpetually beaming smile, which some personnel report finding unnerving.

Subject 7639's defining feature is her head covering – a black hoodie. No matter the temperature or occasion, she is never seen without it. Analysis of the material has shown no anomalous properties.

Despite her friendly demeanor, subject 7639 is a valuable asset to site security. Her outgoing personality allows her to defuse tense situations easily, and she has a keen eye for suspicious behavior. Subject 7639's upbeat personality can sometimes lead her to make inappropriate jokes or engage in silly behavior, but her performance as a security guard is not affected.

Addendum 7639-A: It is strongly advised that personnel do not engage in extended conversations with subject 7639. Analysis of her conversations indicates a high likelihood of personnel divulging sensitive information or making promises they are unable to keep.
