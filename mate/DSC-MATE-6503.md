Item #: DSC-MATE-6503

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6503 is to be contained in a reinforced cell with no windows, located deep within Site-██. The door to the cell must be made of reinforced steel and be locked using an electronic keypad. Guards are to be posted 24/7 just outside the cell to ensure DSC-MATE-6503 does not escape.

DSC-MATE-6503 is to be restrained with specialized cuffs that prevent the use of her abilities. In case of an emergency, the guards are to activate the on-site sprinkler system to stun DSC-MATE-6503 and allow for safe retrieval. 

Description: 
DSC-MATE-6503 is a humanoid creature of the female gender with spots all over her skin, purple lips, and orange eyebrows. She possesses an ability to manipulate time and space, which makes her one of the most dangerous DSCs. DSC-MATE-6503 is capable of creating time loops and teleporting herself and others through space-time. She claims that her abilities come with a price, as she often suffers from memory loss and forgetfulness.

DSC-MATE-6503 dresses in a 00s schoolgirl outfit with a two-color band on her forehead, gold earrings, and a choker. She wears a medical mask that covers her mouth, making it impossible to determine her facial expressions.

Due to DSC-MATE-6503's absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, she can sometimes become difficult to contain. In the past, she has been known to create temporal anomalies or redirect teleportation into key Foundation locations. DSC-MATE-6503 can be deceptive and manipulative, often putting Foundation staff in danger to escape.

DSC-MATE-6503 is not to be underestimated, as her abilities can be deadly if not properly contained. All personnel that come into contact with DSC-MATE-6503 must follow strict containment procedures to avoid accidental manipulation of time and space. Any changes to DSC-MATE-6503's behavior or abilities must be reported immediately to the on-site supervisor.
