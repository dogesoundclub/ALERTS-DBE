Item #: 7801

Special Containment Procedures: 7801 is to be allowed to carry out her job as a delivery driver without interruption. However, any indications of an unstable emotional state are to be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation agent for evaluation.

Description: 7801 is a human female of average height and build. Their face is marked with orange stripes, giving them a distinct and recognizable appearance. It is worth noting that their eyes are composed of VR Rainbow LED technology, which is extremely rare, if not unique, for a human.

The head of 7801 is colored in metallic blue, causing them to stand out in a crowd. A pair of goggles is usually rested on their forehead as an accessory. This is believed to have no use but is often used as a conversation starter.

An additional accessory is a cigarette that is a constant presence of 7801. Despite the numerous attempts made to get them to stop smoking, 7801 shows no signs of wanting to kick the habit.

Despite their unusual appearance, 7801's personality is even more distinctive. They tend to act impulsively and let their emotions dictate their actions â€“ which can create humourous situations for those around them. This recklessness can also prove to be a liability, and any observation of reckless behavior should be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation agent.

Conclusion: While 7801 could prove potentially problematic, their erratic behaviour has yet to cause any significant breaches in the Veil. However, it is still essential to monitor them closely and continue to enforce containment measures.
