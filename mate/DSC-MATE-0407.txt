SCP-407, also known as "The News Hare," is a male rabbit with red clown eyes and a frightened mouth. He wears a red beanie and a goggle on his forehead, presumably to avoid any potential danger. SCP-407 works as a news anchor, delivering the latest headlines with a jittery enthusiasm that can at times be unsettling. 

Despite his nervous disposition, SCP-407 is known to be highly energetic and eager to excite others about current events. He is always looking for the next big story, and his passion for journalism is contagious. However, his enthusiasm can sometimes lead him to focus on stories that may not be of interest to others, and his attempts to get people excited about these topics can be comedic in nature. 

SCP-407's personality is reflective of his species, as rabbits are known for their energy and enthusiasm. However, his red clown eyes and frightened mouth are not typical physical traits of rabbits, leading researchers to believe that SCP-407 may have been subject to anomalous experimentation. Further investigation is ongoing.
