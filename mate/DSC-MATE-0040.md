Item #: 40

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Individual 40 is to be allowed to go about their daily business as an urban mechanic without interference. No contact is to be established with the individual unless necessary for Foundation-related matters.

Description: Individual 40 is a human female with bright orange stripes on their face and orange eyebrows. They are known to wear a bucket hat on their head with a 2-color band across their forehead. Individual 40 is often seen donning a medical mask, but it is not clear if this is due to personal preference or for health and safety reasons.

Individual 40 often wears a single jade earring and a gold chain as accessories. Their natural charm and charisma make them the life of the party, often telling jokes and doing silly dances to engage with others. However, care must be taken, as their winning personality may lead to situations where they are exploited by others.

Further study of Individual 40 suggests that they possess a high degree of mechanical prowess, allowing them to excel as an urban mechanic. No anomalous properties have been observed in Individual 40, and they have shown no knowledge of the paranormal. However, their proximity to known anomalous areas should be monitored.

Addendum: Due to Individual 40's natural charm, it may be beneficial to utilize them in future Foundation operations where diplomacy and ease of communication are essential. Further observations will be made on this potential use.
