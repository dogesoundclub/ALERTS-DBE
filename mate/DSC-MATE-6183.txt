SCP-6183, also known as "The Mischievous Monkey Firefighter", is a male primate of the species Macaca nigra. Despite his species being non-anomalous, SCP-6183 has displayed unusual abilities including the ability to manipulate fire and resistance to high temperatures.

SCP-6183 is typically seen wearing a set of normal glasses, and has black hair on his head. He is also often noted by the presence of a jade earring in his right ear and a candy stick, which he tends to use for both practical and mischievous purposes.

SCP-6183's personality can be quite unpredictable, with a tendency towards rebelliousness and boundary-pushing. This has led to several incidents where SCP-6183 has intentionally broken rules or found ways to bend them just for the sake of curiosity or amusement.

Although SCP-6183 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel or the general public, it is important to exercise caution when interacting with him. His powers can be highly destructive and he may be inclined to use them in ways that may result in harm.

As with all SCP-specimens, SCP-6183 is to be contained in a secure facility and only allowed to leave under very controlled circumstances. Any individuals who come into contact with SCP-6183 should be thoroughly debriefed and monitored for signs of anomalous behavior.
