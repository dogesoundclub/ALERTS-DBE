Description: Item 5483 is a male monkey of the Circopithecus genus similar to the sooty mangabey breed. The separated pink head and red clown eyes of the subject make him easily recognizable, and even more so with the goggle on his forehead. He often wears a silver chain and can be found smoking a cigarette.

The subject is famous as a news anchor owing to his uncanny ability to deliver news with a dry sense of humor that can tickle even the straightest faces. His deadpan jokes are known to stun and surprise the audience. However, the Foundation discovered that the effects of the subject's humor are not limited to the mundane.

Item 5483 is capable of affecting individuals with his humor at an anomalous level. His delivery of news often causes euphoria and mild hallucinations in the audience, which has a stronger effect on anomalous subjects. In some instances, subjects have reported seeing their repressed emotions or alternate realities after listening to the subjectâ€™s newscast.

Addendum: The subject's behavior and abilities are still under research. Tests are being conducted to gauge the extent of its effects on both human and anomalous subjects.
