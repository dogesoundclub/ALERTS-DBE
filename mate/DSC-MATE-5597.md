Description: Subject 5597, codenamed Riker, is a male Bengal tiger with blue clown eyes. Riker is an anomaly in his species as he is capable of wearing a headset with LED light that allows him to communicate with humans in their language. He often dons a red scarf, and carries a whistle, which he uses to alert his fellow guards of potential threats.

Riker is a social creature and thrives on being the center of attention. He is outgoing and gregarious, sometimes to the point of being boisterous. Riker has a knack for telling jokes and stories that are so comical they have been known to cause individuals to weep tears of laughter.

Despite his friendly demeanor, Riker takes his job as a security guard seriously. He is diligent and vigilant, always on the lookout for any sign of danger. He is willing to put himself in harm's way to protect the individuals he has been entrusted to guard.

It is to be noted that while Riker may appear to be a friendly, affable creature, he is still a wild animal capable of attacking with deadly force. Therefore, it is advised that individuals not engage with him directly and instead approach with the utmost caution.

Addendum: Riker has been observed to possess a heightened sense of awareness and intuition, bordering on the psychic. It is recommended that further testing be conducted to determine the extent of his abilities.
