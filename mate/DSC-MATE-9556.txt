Item #: 9556

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9556 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The room must be soundproofed and equipped with a high-quality air filtration system due to unknown risks inherent in its gear. No less than two (2) personnel are to be present outside the containment chamber at all times to ensure its compliance and prevent its escape. Any attempts at communication or negotiation must be avoided due to the potential risks involved.

Description: SCP-9556 is an anomalous humanoid creature that appears to be a human female politician with a pink rabbit head. It has spots on its face and wears normal glasses, a silver chain, golden earring, and a gas mask while in its appearance. Despite its appearance, SCP-9556 behaves and communicates like any other human.

SCP-9556 has demonstrated an unusual level of empathy for other creatures, with a particular fondness for animals and nature. It may become emotionally affected when it witnesses pain and suffering in others, sometimes resulting in crying and emotional outbursts. This personality trait is possibly linked to its apparent connection to the rabbit and nature.

Addendum: SCP-9556 was first discovered during a routine investigation of an animal rights organization. It was found actively working to promote the organization's cause, and its anomalous nature was quickly identified. After a brief struggle, SCP-9556 was successfully contained and brought to the Foundation for further study.

SCP-9556 poses no immediate danger to Foundation personnel, but its anomalous nature and behavior warrant containment and monitoring. Further research into its connection to the rabbit and nature is ongoing.
