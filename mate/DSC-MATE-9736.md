DSC-MATE-9736, also known as "The Hare Stylist", is a male rabbit of an unknown breed with features that sets him apart from his more mundane cousins. Identified as a beautician, DSC-MATE-9736 wears a purple cap adorned with green hair and is usually found wearing a gold chain around his neck. He is also known to wear jade earrings on his fur-covered ears that appears to have no immediate effect on his physiology. His most striking feature, however, is his nerd glasses that give him an air of intelligence that is rare among his kind.

DSC-MATE-9736 exhibits a frightened mouth, which accentuates his timid persona. Despite his appearance, he is known for having a bold and spontaneous personality, and often takes calculated risks on a whim. There have been reports of him jumping off of cliffs into rivers or lakes, only to emerge unharmed and with renewed vigor.

Researchers have noted that this unpredictable behavior may be due to the rabbit's species, which has been classified as anomalous. It is suggested that his genetics may have been altered, resulting in his unique abilities and unusual appearance. DSC-MATE-9736 is an expert in hairstyling, frequently demonstrating remarkable skill and creativity in his work, most of which are reportedly capable of producing anomalous effects on his clients.

Although DSC-MATE-9736 appears to be a friendly and affable creature, caution is advised when interacting with him, as his unpredictable behavior and abilities may cause unexpected and potentially dangerous results. Containment procedures have been put in place to ensure the safety of both DSC-MATE-9736 and the general populace.
