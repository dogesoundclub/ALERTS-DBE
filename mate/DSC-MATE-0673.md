Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-673 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██, equipped with the necessary veterinary equipment to ensure his well-being.

Description: DSC-MATE-673 is a male rabbit, standing at 15 centimeters in height and weighing approximately 500 grams, being of domesticated origin. It is usually donned in a purple cap with a headset accompanied with horn-rimmed glasses over its large, brown eyes. DSC-MATE-673 also has a red scarf tied around its neck, and a goggle strapped over its forehead. Anomalous properties of DSC-MATE-673 are activated when it makes eye contact with its subject. 

DSC-MATE-673 is known to have a jovial personality and a great sense of humor, often entertaining its colleagues by telling engaging stories, making silly impersonations, and lightening the mood in stressful situations. Despite being a rabbit, DSC-MATE-673 is able to understand and communicate in fluent English, as it is capable of telepathy. DSC-MATE-673 appears to have a unique ability to understand the language of other animals and is often called upon to assist in their diagnosis and care as it is also a qualified veterinarian. 

DSC-MATE-673 has been observed to experience heightened levels of anxiety and discomfort when physically touched unexpectedly or if there is any breach of protocol. Due to this, approval must be granted for any interactions or tests involving DSC-MATE-673. Any staff involved in research with DSC-MATE-673 must receive training on basic rabbit care and handling techniques to ensure the safety and well-being of the rabbit. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-673 has requested that it be allowed to keep a miniature garden in its containment chamber for both relaxing and as a form of therapy. Due to its triviality and reportedly no threat to the Foundation's safety, this request has been approved. DSC-MATE-673 has granted permission to any personnel to visit its "garden" and interact with it during designated visiting hours.
