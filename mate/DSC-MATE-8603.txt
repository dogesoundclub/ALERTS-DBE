Item #: SCP-8603

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8603 is to be housed in a secure, standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be furnished with appropriate platforms for his jumping needs, and a bed with comfortable and fluffy material to avoid any injuries to it. He also requires recreational items such as hula-hoops, puzzles, and books to entertain himself.

SCP-8603 must not be exposed to any real estate marketing materials or advertisements, as this may cause them distress or trigger their anomalous effects.

SCP-8603's housing and health requirements are to be maintained by a dedicated member of the containment staff, who must have undergone training in rabbit handling and care.

Description: SCP-8603, the Real Estate Agent Rabbit, is a male rabbit of domestic breed. It measures approximately 30 cm in length and weighs around 1.5 kg. What makes SCP-8603 remarkable, however, is its bright red clown-like eyes and a blue bandana across its head. SCP-8603 also carries a whistle around its neck as it was commonly used to summon attention during real estate auctions.

SCP-8603 is highly enthusiastic and loves to make everyone laugh. It has an infectious and jovial personality which may result in humorous situations like cracking jokes, reciting funny stories, and performing silly impersonations. However, this behavior has been observed to cause mild distractibility to anyone exposed to it for extended periods of time.

SCP-8603's anomalous effect comes into play when it interacts with the human perceptions of real estate, causing all individuals exposed to them to experience excessive joy and happiness while contemplating purchasing or bidding for any kind of real estate property. This effect has been shown to be highly addictive and persists even after SCP-8603 is removed. Test subjects have been observed to develop an unyielding obsession with real estate, often ignoring basic needs like food and shelter in pursuit of acquiring property.

Addendum: On 02/03/2022, SCP-8603 was exposed to a stack of real estate marketing flyers accidentally left in its exercise area. The resulting effect caused a large portion of the staff working on the SCP facility to become obsessed with real estate acquisitions. As per procedure, the contaminated area was quarantined, and all affected personnel were given amnestics for the duration of the exposure. SCP-8603 was administered a mild sedative and transferred to a newly constructed enclosure in the on-site veterinarian clinic, where it was observed to return to full health within a day.
