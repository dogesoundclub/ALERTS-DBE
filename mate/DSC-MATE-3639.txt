SCP-3639 is a Class-Delivery Driver, distinguished by their distinct appearance and strong-willed personality. The subject is a human female with striking orange stripes framing their face, giving them an almost feline appearance. Adding to this unique appearance is a pair of goggles perched on their forehead, a nod to their love of adventure and exploration.

The subject's head is reminiscent of the 00s schoolgirl style, with long dark hair pulled back in a high ponytail, and a no-nonsense expression that gives the impression of someone who always has a plan. Further adding to this impression is a gold earring in the shape of a loop, which hangs from their left ear and catches the light in a way that speaks to their inner determination.

SCP-3639 is rarely seen without their gold chain, which they wear as both an accessory and a symbol of their resilience and grit. Whether traversing the city's bustling streets or venturing into the unknown, SCP-3639 is always prepared, with an unwavering focus on their end goal.

Despite their sometimes intimidating demeanor, SCP-3639 is driven by a desire to see things done efficiently and effectively. Their strong and decisive personality stems from a deep sense of duty towards their work, a sense of duty that sometimes translates into being bossy towards others. However, this characteristic only serves to sharpen their focus on the task at hand, making them invaluable to the delivery team.

In summary, SCP-3639 is a prime example of human determination and grit, someone whose appearance may seem at odds with their personality but whose inner drive pushes them to succeed in all they do.
