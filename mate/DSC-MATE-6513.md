Item #: 6513

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6513 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19. All staff must be advised to avoid physical contact with 6513 as he is known to be unpredictable.

Description: 6513 is a male tiger with bright blue fur and a white chest. He has been observed wearing horned rim glasses and a doge hat as well as a red cross earring in his left ear, a gold chain around his neck, and a whistle. He identifies himself as a beautician, however there is no record of him being licensed to practice.

6513 has shown to possess humanoid-like intelligence as he is able to communicate with personnel through verbal and non-verbal means effectively. He also displays tendencies of being idealistic, passionately supporting movements and causes he believes to be just. His idealistic tendencies make him unpredictable and sometimes difficult to interact with, as his actions and reactions can be sudden and aggressive.

Addendum: During a routine checkup, it was discovered that 6513 exhibits enhanced abilities in areas such as speed, agility and strength, beyond those of any regular tiger. While the cause of said enhancements remains unknown.
