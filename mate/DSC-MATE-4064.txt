Item #: SCP-4064

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4064 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any member of staff entering SCP-4064's cell must wear Level A protection gear, including a full-face gas mask. Under no circumstances may SCP-4064 remove her headset, or any other accessory which conceals or distorts her facial features.

Description: SCP-4064 appears to be a female human of average height and build. However, SCP-4064 has distinctive orange stripes along her cheeks and nose, and her eyes are a bright blue similar to those of a clown. SCP-4064 wears a headset with LED lights, a gold chain, and a normal gas mask as her accessories.

SCP-4064 possesses an unusual personality that is highly emotional and sentimental. SCP-4064 exhibits a strong fondness for music and art that evoke strong emotions, and this often leads to tears or extreme emotional reactions.

SCP-4064's occupation is as a Real Estate Agent, which often brings SCP-4064 into contact with non-Foundation individuals. SCP-4064's anomalous nature may become apparent in these situations, and Foundation agents must intercept and provide cover stories to prevent SCP-4064's discovery.

Addendum: SCP-4064 was brought to the Foundation's attention after an incident where SCP-4064 became highly emotional during a movie screening, causing a local panic due to SCP-4064's unusual physical appearance. SCP-4064 was contained shortly after by Foundation staff posing as local law enforcement.

Note: Despite SCP-4064's seemingly harmless anomaly, SCP-4064 must be monitored for potential emotional or mental instability. SCP-4064's emotional reactions may lead to unpredictable actions, and close monitoring is necessary.
