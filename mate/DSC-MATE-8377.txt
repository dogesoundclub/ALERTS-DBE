Item #: SCP-8377

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8377 is to be monitored at all times through regular office and bodycam footage. SCP-8377 is to be kept on duty as an urban traffic officer in designated areas, but is not to be allowed to work for longer than 8-hour shifts due to the potential overworking and physical harm that could result in this ability. SCP-8377's movements, daily routine, and social interactions are to be recorded and reviewed by assigned personnel.

Description: SCP-8377 appears to be a male rabbit of average height and build, with normal glasses for vision, ears pierced with a gold earring, and a red scarf with a diamond-shaped pattern around his neck. SCP-8377 has normal rabbit fur, but it is noted that the rabbit's fur takes an unarranged green color in certain exposures to sunlight. SCP-8377 has exhibited the ability to control movements and actions of civilians within a radius of 10 meters.

SCP-8377 possesses a strong and guttural personality, which some personnel have described as bossy, intimidating, and direct. SCP-8377's behavior is attributed to his determination to ensure maximum efficiency and effective functioning of his assigned duties as a traffic officer. SCP-8377 is able to provide the masses with the most efficient routes to take, which enables them to reach their destinations quickly.

Addendum: SCP-8377 has established itself as a crucial member of the SCP Foundation Urban Division. It possesses unique abilities that make the control of the flow of traffic simpler and better. SCP-8377 is currently being evaluated and tested for more practical use within the Foundation.
