Description: SCP-7260 is a male monkey that stands at an average height of 1.2 meters. SCP-7260 serves as a news anchor for a local television station. SCP-7260's face features a frightened mouth and red clown eyes. Its head is not arranged green and has a goggle on its forehead. It is wearing a jade earring and a gold chain as accessories.

SCP-7260 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. Its personality can lead to humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Despite its friendly nature, personnel are advised to maintain a cautious attitude when interacting with SCP-7260. SCP-7260 has been observed to use its charisma and humorous personality to manipulate its surroundings and escape its containment chamber. 

SCP-7260's anomalous properties allow it to produce a distorted version of its news broadcasts capable of inducing temporary madness in individuals who view it directly. The effects of SCP-7260's broadcasts are not permanent, and subjects typically return to their baseline mental state within 24 hours. 

Addendum: SCP-7260 is a highly trained and experienced news anchor that has gained the trust and admiration of many viewers. The Foundation has determined that the potential risk of SCP-7260's anomalous broadcasting abilities far outweigh the benefits of its newscasting career. Efforts are ongoing to prevent SCP-7260 from broadcasting its distorted news.
