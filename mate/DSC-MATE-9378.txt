Item #: SCP-9378

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9378 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with environmental settings suitable for an earth rabbit. SCP-9378 is not to be given any weapons or objects that could cause harm to himself or others. Due to the nature of SCP-9378's personality, all interacting personnel are advised to remain vigilant and keep a distance of at least 2 meters from SCP-9378. Any attempts to hack or disrupt SCP-9378's VR Jade LED eyes must be reported immediately to Site Security.

Description: SCP-9378 is a male adult rabbit with average physical characteristics. SCP-9378's most prominent features are his frightened mouth and VR Jade LED eyes, which emit a faint glow in the dark. SCP-9378's head is adorned with a police cap, and his ears have a jade earring attached to it. SCP-9378 also wears a gold chain around his neck and an LED gas mask as a precautionary measure.

SCP-9378's personality can be described as rebellious and mischievous. SCP-9378 enjoys pushing boundaries and bending rules for his own entertainment, leading to several humorous situations. SCP-9378 has been known to purposely break containment procedures and find ways to escape confinement, using his wit and agility to avoid detection. SCP-9378, however, has not displayed any malicious intent or desire to harm Foundation personnel.

Addendum: After several escape attempts, it has been suggested that SCP-9378 be transferred to a more secure facility or contained in a designated outdoor area. Further testing is required to ascertain the extent of SCP-9378's abilities and potential threat level. Until then, all interacting personnel must remain vigilant at all times.
