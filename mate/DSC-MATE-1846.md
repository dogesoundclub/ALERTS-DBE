Item #: DSC-MATE-1846

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1846 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access is granted to individuals with Level 2 clearance or above, and all personnel must wear appropriate protective gear when interacting with DSC-MATE-1846.

Description: DSC-MATE-1846 is a human female with distinct physical features. She has a purple lip, unarranged green hair, and a green cross earring on both ears. Her mouth is always obscured by a medical mask, and she wears a black choker around her neck.

DSC-MATE-1846 displays exceptional practical skills and is an expert in fixing things. She has a tendency to use unconventional methods, such as duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects. DSC-MATE-1846 can develop improvised solutions to complex problems, which has been attributed to her practical and hands-on nature.

Despite her practicality, DSC-MATE-1846 can be difficult to communicate with due to her mask, which has not been removed since her initial containment. Her level of cooperation varies, depending on her mood and perceived threat level.

DSC-MATE-1846's profession is being a banker but that is yet to be confirmed as there is no evidence on her. Further investigation is necessary to determine her true identity.

Addendum: On 14/██/20██, DSC-MATE-1846 was reported to have repaired a broken surveillance camera within her containment cell using only a paper clip and a discarded stapler, which were found in her cell. This event showcases DSC-MATE-1846's capabilities and the imminent need for supervision to ensure the security of the containment area.
