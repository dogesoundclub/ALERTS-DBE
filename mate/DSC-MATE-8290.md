Item #: 8290

Designation: Monkey Press

Special Containment Procedures: Item 8290 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to camera and audio monitoring is permitted for research and documentation purposes. Any team member entering Item 8290's cell must be equipped with a protective mask due to the high risk of transmission through saliva or other bodily fluids.

Description: Item 8290 is a male monkey of the Macaque species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighing 15 kilograms. One noteworthy feature includes its circus-like blue clown eyes, along with a police cap on its head and a jade earring on each of its ears. It also dons a gold chain necklace and an LED gas mask as its primary accessories.

Item 8290's personality traits often include a witty sense of humor, humorously telling jokes and sharing funny stories to make others laugh, even though it may seem a bit peculiar coming from a monkey. Its silliness and sense of humor may appear harmless, but researchers have observed moments in which Item 8290 can become dangerous when agitated or threatened.

Analysis: The origins of Item 8290 remain unknown. It was first discovered in a newsroom in downtown ████████, dressed in a suit and tie, carrying a pen and notebook, and interviewing one of the staff members. After taking an interest in journalism and reporting, Item 8290 became fixated on the idea of becoming a reporter itself.

Enamored with gossip and scoops, Item 8290 has made several attempts at "breaking the big stories" by any means necessary, including tampering with classified documents, hacking emails, and even breaking into secure facilities to obtain secret information. Its intent appears to be purely for the thrill of the chase, and it has yet to display any affiliation with an organization or group.

Conclusion: Item 8290 is to be monitored closely for any use of its access privileges to sensitive information or rumors that could potentially cause damage to the Foundation or the public. Any signs of increased agitation or aggressive behavior should warrant increased measures to protect staff and maintain containment.
