Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7640 is to be contained within a specially reinforced room outfitted with monkey-friendly amenities such as a rope swing, hammock, and a variety of toys. All staff interacting with SCP-7640 should wear proper protective gear to prevent any accidental injuries that may occur due to SCP-7640's lively personality. Access to SCP-7640 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-7640 is a male monkey identified as a banker by its job title. Its physical appearance is unique due to the horned rim glasses it wears over its large, expressive eyes, and its pink hair parted to one side. SCP-7640 also sports a silver chain around its neck and is often seen carrying a candy stick in its hands.

Personality-wise, SCP-7640 is impulsive and enjoys taking risks. It is not uncommon for SCP-7640 to jump off of tall structures or engage in other dangerous activities on a whim. This behavior can lead to potentially harmful situations that require constant monitoring and intervention by Foundation staff. SCP-7640 has shown a talent for financial dealings and business strategy, but its unpredictable nature makes it difficult to rely on in professional settings.

SCP-7640 is also capable of speech and has a particular affinity for making puns and telling jokes. While its humor is not always appreciated by Foundation personnel, it is nonetheless an endearing trait.

Due to its unpredictable nature, SCP-7640 is classified as Euclid. While it has not demonstrated any malicious intent, its tendency towards reckless behavior makes it a potential hazard. Following standard safety protocols is essential in personnel interactions with SCP-7640.
