Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-3168 is contained at Site-██ under the guise of a local news reporter. To ensure continued cooperation, SCP-3168 must not be made aware of their anomalous properties. 

Description:
SCP-3168 appears to be a human male in his late 20s. SCP-3168's face features orange stripes that appear to have been digitally added to his skin. SCP-3168's eyes resemble ski goggles and his head is parted pink. A medical mask covers the lower half of their face, preventing observation of their mouth. SCP-3168 often wears a gold chain accessory and has a goggle attachment on their forehead.

Personality:
SCP-3168 is exceptionally observant and exhibits an above-average attention to detail in gift-giving situations. SCP-3168 can become preoccupied with presenting a flawless gift and may dedicate excessive amounts of time to creating it. SCP-3168 also displays a tendency towards hypervigilance and may require emotional support during these periods.

Addendum:
On multiple occasions, SCP-3168 has expressed an interest in anomalously enhanced gift creation. Request denied.
