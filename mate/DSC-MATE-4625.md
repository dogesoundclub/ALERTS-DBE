Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject designated as 4625 has been contained in a reinforced containment chamber at Site-███.

Any maintenance or cleaning staff entering the chamber must wear level 4 biohazard and chemical suits, and any contact or interaction with 4625 is strictly prohibited.

Description: 4625 appears to be a male rabbit with a heightened sense of emotion, demonstrated by a tendency towards strong reactions to movies, music, and art. The subject displays a distinct frightened expression that remains constant, accompanied by a pair of horned rim glasses. Its head is covered by a hoodie, and it wears a 2 color band on its forehead. Additionally, a gas mask is typically worn by 4625.

It is unknown how this creature has gained sentience, but it is clear that it possesses an unnaturally heightened sense of emotional awareness. It is able to communicate and respond to verbal cues, but is prone to becoming overwhelmed by negative emotions such as fear, anger, or sadness.

Addendum: 4625 was discovered after reports of individuals suffering from intense emotional outbursts in the vicinity of its previous location. Containment was established following several incidents in which individuals were found to have come into contact with 4625 and experienced severe sensory overload followed by an emotional meltdown. It is recommended that all personnel remain vigilant and exercise caution around 4625. Any attempts to communicate with 4625 must first be approved by the Site Director.
