Item #: 908

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 908 is to be housed in a secure, rabbit-proof enclosure at all times. Access to Item 908 should be granted only with permission from at least two Level 3 personnel. Researchers or personnel entering Item 908's enclosure must wear body armor with reinforced face protection, as Item 908 has been known to bite or scratch when frightened. 

Description: Item 908 appears to be a male rabbit with typical physical characteristics. However, its face exhibits a perpetual expression of fear and anxiety, with its mouth constantly open and trembling. Its eyes are unnaturally red and oversized, giving a clownish appearance. It wears a police cap on its head and a gold earring in its left ear. It is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick.

Personality: Despite its appearance, Item 908 is friendly and nurturing towards those it trusts. Its caring nature extends to everyone around it, often attempting to care for strangers and treating them like family. This behavior can result in humorous and awkward situations, as Item 908 will frequently act as a caregiver to those much larger and stronger than itself. However, Item 908 is timid and easily frightened, which can lead to aggressive behavior when it feels threatened or unsafe. 

Addendum 1: Item 908 was discovered after a local firefighter reported an unusual rabbit assisting them in rescuing victims from a burning building. Item 908 was found to have an affinity for firefighting and was quickly recruited as an honorary firefighter. It has been trained to help locate trapped victims and carry small tools into confined spaces. Despite its usefulness, Item 908 must be monitored at all times during firefighting operations, as it is easily panicked and can cause additional harm if not kept under control. 

Addendum 2: Item 908 exhibits a strong aversion to water, often becoming agitated and frightened when presented with large bodies of water or even small containers. Experiments have shown that Item 908's behavior is linked to a traumatic incident in its early childhood involving water. Further research is ongoing to ascertain if Item 908's aversion can be overcome or if it is a permanent effect of its past experiences.
