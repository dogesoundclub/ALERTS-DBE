Item #: 2107

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 2107 is to be allowed to freely conduct business as a licensed real estate agent in the area designated by the Foundation. Standard covert monitoring protocols are to be adhered to during all interactions with subjects.

Description: 2107 is a female human with vibrant green hair styled in an edgy curl that frames a coquettish face that features purple lips. Her forehead supports two bands of color at odd angles, seemingly dyed into the skin. A single goggle rests clumsily on her forehead.

The subject's ears support jewelry in the form of gold hoops, and she is known to have a habit of smoking cigarettes casually.

Despite her unconventional appearance, 2107 is a caring and nurturing individual who is quick to lend a helping hand to those in need. Her propensity to treat those around her as her own children has led to many humorous situations.

Personnel interacting with 2107 should exercise caution, as she has been known to be overly trusting and may inadvertently reveal classified information.

Addendum: 2107's warm personality and approachability make her an asset in undercover operations, as she can quickly gain the trust of unsuspecting individuals. However, her inability to keep Foundation secrets may lead to further review of her status.
