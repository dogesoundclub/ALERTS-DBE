Item #: 4400

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4400 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Due to his job as a Traffic Officer, he is allowed to leave his containment during work hours. However, he must be accompanied by at least one Level 3 personnel at all times. Unauthorized removal of his accouterments is strictly forbidden. 

Description: Subject 4400 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 3 feet tall. His eyes are almost constantly obscured by normal glasses which he wears. His head is covered by a blue bandana, and he wears a goggle on his forehead. The subject has both ears pierced, with one sporting a jade earring.  He is always seen carrying a whistle with him, which he is known to blow frequently. 

While generally friendly and easy to approach, 4400 has a mischievous streak and a great sense of humor. He enjoys making others laugh and taking part in humorous situations. Despite this, he has shown a surprisingly responsible and serious side while at work, taking his traffic duties very seriously. 

Addendum: Subject 4400 is a valuable asset to the Foundation due to his specific skillset in traffic control. He is an active member of the Mobile Task Force Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox") when responding to urban sites that require the use of his expertise. It should be noted that subject 4400 is a rabbit, and, as such, has considerably lower survivability rates when compared to other humanoid task force members. As such, any assignments should be reviewed and undertaken after careful consideration of the potential risk involved.
