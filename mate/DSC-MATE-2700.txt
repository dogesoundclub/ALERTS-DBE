Item #: 2700

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2700 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and direct interaction is strictly forbidden without a Level 4 authorization. Any unauthorized approach shall result in immediate neutralization. 2700's whereabouts and activities must be reported hourly, and all footage must undergo thorough inspection for any signs of anomalous activity.

Description: 2700 appears to be a humanoid tiger, with piercing red clown-like eyes and a red beanie on top of its head. It sports a single gold earring on its left ear, along with a silver chain necklace. It is also commonly seen wearing a standard gas mask. Its physical capabilities are yet to be tested. However, it has displayed enhanced strength and agility during its escape attempts.

2700's personality is highly independent, and it rebels against rules and regulations that it deems unnecessary. It has been observed sneaking out of their office early and taking unauthorized leaves of absence. It is also highly unpredictable and violent, and its actions may seem irrational and without motive.

Addendum: 2700 was first discovered during an incident in a local government building when it attacked several employees, leaving them severely injured. After a significant loss of resources and manpower, the Foundation was able to neutralize 2700 and transfer him to our undisclosed location.

Dr. [REDACTED] has proposed a possible connection between 2700 and other anomalies with feline-based attributes. Further research is ongoing.
