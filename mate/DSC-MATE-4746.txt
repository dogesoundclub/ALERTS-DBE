Item #: SCP-4746

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4746 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to any and all books, documentaries, or other educational materials must be monitored and limited by assigned personnel. Any attempts by SCP-4746 to share information regarding obscure topics must be met with redirection and distraction tactics to prevent overloading of the subject's mind.

Description: SCP-4746 is a male human of average height and weight with a unique set of facial features. The most notable feature is a mouth spot located on the lower left side of the subject's face. SCP-4746 also dons a medical mask, a metal purple head, VR rainbow LED eyes, and a gold earring on the left ear. The subject frequently wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-4746 possesses a thirst for knowledge and education, often delving into obscure topics that the subject can become passionate about. This passion for learning often leads to an obsessive pursuit of new knowledge, leaving SCP-4746 unable to function properly if not adequately engaged. It is believed that the mouth spot and constant need to wear a medical mask are the result of nocturnal habits that require a higher level of respiratory protection.

SCP-4746's ability to share information is exceptional but can become overwhelming and dangerous if not managed carefully. The subject's enthusiasm for knowledge can result in lapses in judgment, leading to potential breaches in containment and exposure to other SCPs. As such, all interactions with SCP-4746 must be conducted with extreme caution.

Addendum: SCP-4746 has been successful in making several contributions to the Foundation's research, and as such, access to certain educational materials has been granted on a case-by-case basis. It is the hope of Foundation personnel that the subject's potential can be utilized without allowing it to become a liability.
