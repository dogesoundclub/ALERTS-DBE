Item #: 1672

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 1672 is to be allowed free movement unless otherwise instructed by Foundation personnel. Any communication between 1672 and non-Foundation individuals must be monitored for potential information leaks regarding the existence of anomalous entities. In the event of such a leak, a cover story must be provided.

Description: 1672 is a male human with blonde hair and gold earring in his ear. He has a unique facial feature in the form of a small spot on his mouth. His eyes are obscured behind nerdy glasses, and his mouth is usually covered by a medical mask. He appears to be of average height and build, but his movements are often nervously anxious.

1672's personality is characterized by a no-nonsense attitude and traditional values. He enjoys sharing jokes and stories passed down from his family and community, which he delivers in a playful manner. However, this belies an underlying fearfulness, and he is easily frightened by sudden events or unexpected encounters.

One peculiar aspect of 1672 is his connection to the supernatural. While he doesn't possess any overt abilities himself, he seems to have a preternatural awareness of otherworldly beings and occurrences. It is suspected that this unique trait may be linked to his familial or cultural heritage. Careful monitoring of his activities and interactions may yield valuable information in this regard.

Addendum: In light of 1672's abilities, he was recruited as a reporter for the Foundation's Paranormal News Network. His knowledge and experience in navigating the supernatural world make him a valuable asset in gathering information and keeping the masses informed of anomalous phenomena.
