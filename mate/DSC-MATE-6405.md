DSC-MATE-6405, also known as "The Striped Mechanic," is a humanoid female of the human species with striking orange stripes on their face. They exhibit a friendly disposition and often sport a genuine smile. However, their blue clown eyes suggest a playful nature that should not be underestimated.

Their head is typically covered by a hoodie, and they accessorize with a choker around their neck. As a mechanic by trade, they are known for their expertise in repairing and modifying machinery, often taking on projects others would deem impossible.

In addition to their technical skills, DSC-MATE-6405 has a creative and artistic side that they may express through various hobbies or interests. They seem to find great joy in painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of artistic expression, using their abilities to create unique and often surreal pieces.

While DSC-MATE-6405 is not inherently dangerous, it is important to monitor their creative output carefully, as they have been known to imbue their creations with anomalous properties that can cause unforeseen consequences. Overall, DSC-MATE-6405 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, but as with all humanoid DSCs, they must be managed with great care.
