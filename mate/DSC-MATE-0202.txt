Item #: 202

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-202 is to be monitored closely with regular psychological evaluations to ensure that they are mentally stable. They are allowed to continue their job as a delivery driver as long as they do not reveal any information about the Foundation or any anomalous entities.

Description: SCP-202 appears to be a human male, with distinctive facial features. A black spot can be observed on the left side of their mouth, and they constantly wear a smile. SCP-202's eyes are protected by ski goggles, and they often sport a doge hat on their head, with a small jade earring in one ear. They also wear a silver chain necklace and carry a candy stick as an accessory.

SCP-202 has a laid-back and easy-going personality, but they can demonstrate fierce loyalty and protectiveness towards their loved ones. It is recommended that personnel avoid making negative comments about anyone close to SCP-202 to prevent triggering their protective behavior.

SCP-202 is a delivery driver, often transporting packages and documents. There has been no observation of any anomalous activity from SCP-202 during their routine work. However, they have exhibited above-average driving skills and have shown an ability to navigate through heavy traffic and other obstacles with ease.

Addendum: SCP-202 has been approached by several GoI's, including the Serpent's Hand and the Chaos Insurgency, in attempts to recruit them. SCP-202 has consistently refused offers and has reported them to the Foundation. Their loyalty has been noted and considered a valuable asset in the event of any hostile situation.
