Item #: 8579

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8579 is to be monitored on a regular basis, both physically and psychologically. No electrical devices or appliances are allowed near the subject as he has demonstrated the ability to manipulate and control electricity. Any unauthorized use of electrical devices in his vicinity will result in immediate disciplinary action. Subject 8579's workshop is to be contained within a Faraday cage to prevent any unwanted incidents.

Description: 

Subject 8579 is a male human of average height and build. His mouth spot and green cross earring are notable bodily features. The subject prefers to wear a red victory band on his forehead as a symbol of his would-be rebellion. The subject's nerd glasses reflect his intelligent and practical nature. The subject is always seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

Personality: 

Subject 8579 exhibits a high level of knowledge and skill in electrical engineering. He tends to be practical and hands-on, often fixing things in unconventional ways. His resourcefulness and ingenuity have made him an asset in any electrical-related crisis. Subject 8579's desire to get the job done may lead him to use unorthodox means to repair a broken object or to find a solution to a complex problem. This can sometimes result in dangerous consequences.

Addendum:

Subject 8579 has become increasingly difficult to contain. His proficiency in electrical manipulation and control is rapidly growing, becoming a dangerous ability that could potentially lead to mass destruction if it falls into the wrong hands. It is recommended that the Foundation consider increasing its security measures around the subject to prevent any unauthorized use of his abilities. In the event of an emergency, Protocol 8579-Q, electrical shutdown, is to be implemented immediately.
