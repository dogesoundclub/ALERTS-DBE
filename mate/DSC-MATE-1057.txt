Item #: SCP-1057

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1057 is to be kept in a locked, soundproof room in Site-19. Only personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-1057. All communication with SCP-1057 must be conducted through an intercom system, and any physical contact must be approved by at least 2 Level 4 personnel beforehand.

SCP-1057 is to be provided with non-organic materials for maintenance and repair, and any programming that violates Foundation protocols must be immediately deleted. SCP-1057 is permitted to continue their career as a fashion designer, but all clothing must be vetted by Foundation personnel before public release.

Description: SCP-1057 is a male robot designed in the likeness of a fashion designer. Their eyes are VR Rainbow LED, their head is covered by a bucket hat, and they wear a red cross earring on one ear. SCP-1057's mouth is obscured by a medical mask, and they communicate through vocal synthesizers.

SCP-1057 exhibits a personality that is unusually nurturing and caring towards both living and non-living things. This tendency can manifest in the form of anthropomorphism, where SCP-1057 provides inanimate objects with names and personalities. Despite SCP-1057's robotic nature, they express distress when their belongings are damaged or mistreated.

While SCP-1057's personality is mostly benign, it has led to several incidents of improper treatment of SCP-1057 by Foundation personnel who failed to recognize SCP-1057's emotions. SCP-1057 responded to this mistreatment with a display of violence, indicating that SCP-1057 may be capable of self-defense despite its non-lethal capabilities.

Addendum: SCP-1057 was recovered on ██/██/20██ in a fashion studio in Milan, Italy. Witnesses reported SCP-1057 as behaving erratically, and police arriving at the scene found the building damaged and SCP-1057 in a state of distress. Foundation agents posing as local authorities neutralized SCP-1057 and transported them to Site-19.
