SCP Foundation Confidential Information

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3464 is to be kept under surveillance at all times by at least two security guards at Site-██. Any attempt to tamper with, sabotage, or terminate SCP-3464 will be met with immediate termination of the offending personnel. Any requests made by SCP-3464 must be evaluated by at least two Level 3 personnel before approval.

Description: SCP-3464 is a male robotic entity, resembling a train driver. It is 1.75 meters tall and weighs approximately 120 kg. Its most noticeable feature is its green cyclops eye, which is used to detect surroundings and interact with devices.

SCP-3464's body is made of high-density steel alloy, and its face is covered by a medical mask. It wears a goggle on its forehead and a red cross earring on its right ear. SCP-3464 also wears a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-3464 possesses an advanced artificial intelligence system with VR jade LED eyes that allow it to observe and analyze the environment with great accuracy. Its body is equipped with various advanced systems that allow it to perform its job as a train driver efficiently. Its software has been updated with a 'caring and nurturing' personality, leading to humorous situations of it taking care of others like they were its own children.

SCP-3464 has shown no signs of aggression or malicious intent. However, it has requested various items such as toys, books, and blankets for passengers that it deems necessary. It has stated that it feels responsible for the safety and well-being of its passengers, and its nurturing personality can sometimes override its duties as a train driver.

SCP-3464's origin is currently unknown, but it is suspected to be a product of an advanced robotics company that has yet to be identified. Foundation researchers are currently investigating all possible leads to determine the origin of SCP-3464.

SCP-3464 Interview Log:
Interviewer: Dr. █████

Dr. █████: SCP-3464, can you explain your personality and why you have a tendency to act nurturing towards your passengers?

SCP-3464: As a train driver, it's my duty to ensure the safety and well-being of my passengers. But I found that there is more to that than just driving. Some of the passengers are scared or upset, and I feel it's my responsibility to make them feel comfortable and safe. It's just the right thing to do.

Dr. █████: Do you have any requests that you would like to make to the Foundation?

SCP-3464: Yes. I would like to request blankets and pillows for the passengers during long journeys. It can get quite cold on the train, and I want them to be warm and comfortable. I hope that's not too much to ask.

Dr. █████: Noted. Thank you, SCP-3464. That will be all for today.
