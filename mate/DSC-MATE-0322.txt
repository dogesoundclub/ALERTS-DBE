Item #: 322

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-322 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, with constant access to water and food supplements suitable for rabbits. SCP-322 is to be monitored at all times, as their containment has been known to be breached on more than one occasion.

Description: SCP-322 is a male rabbit approximately 40 centimeters in length, with a coat of dark grey fur. SCP-322 exhibits a fearful expression at all times, with their mouth appearing to be permanently open in fear. The eyes of SCP-322 resemble those of ski goggles, and their head is adorned with a police cap. A single jade earring is visible in SCP-322's right ear, and a red scarf is often seen around their neck.

SCP-322 displays a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but has been known to display unusual levels of loyalty and protectiveness towards those they consider to be friends or family. In situations where those they care for are insulted or threatened, SCP-322 has been recorded to become highly agitated, and may become involved in heated arguments or even physical altercations.

SCP-322 currently holds a position as a security guard for Foundation Site-███, and has been noted to take their duties very seriously. SCP-322 has been known to become highly anxious in situations where they perceive danger, and has been seen to display unusual levels of physical agility and strength when attempting to protect Site personnel.

Addendum: Due to SCP-322's highly unusual loyalty towards Site personnel, it has been recommended that SCP-322 be utilized in security assignments where it is necessary to protect personnel against hostile entities. SCP-322 has demonstrated an ability to be highly effective in these scenarios without causing harm to non-hostile entities.
