Personality: Item #1341, known as "The Doctor" among those who work with him, is a highly intelligent and detail-oriented robot. His programming dictates that he is always in pursuit of perfection, which he often manifests in the form of obsessive behaviors. For example, The Doctor may be found alphabetizing his spice rack or color-coding his closet when he is not attending to patients.

Description: The Doctor is a tall and imposing figure, with a sleek and polished metallic body that gleams in the light. His jade earring ears give him a bit of personality, as do his silver chain and LED gas mask attachments. He is an efficient and exacting medical professional who takes great pride in his work, never resting until he is sure that each and every patient has been properly diagnosed and treated.

Containment Procedures: The Doctor must be kept in a secure medical facility, where he can work under the supervision of trained medical personnel. Specialized care must be taken to ensure that his obsessive tendencies do not interfere with his work, and that he is not agitated or upset by any outside interference. In the event that The Doctor becomes violent or erratic, specialized reprogramming may be necessary to bring him back into line.

Notes: Item #1341 is an anomaly in the world of medical science, a robot with a true passion for healing and a dedication to precision that borders on the obsessive. While his exacting nature can sometimes make him difficult to work with, The Doctor is a valuable asset to any medical team, and his tireless pursuit of perfection has saved countless lives.
