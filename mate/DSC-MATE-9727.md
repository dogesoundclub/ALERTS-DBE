Item #: 9727

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 9727 is currently employed as a car salesman, and has little to no contact with the outside world. However, in the event that it becomes active, it must be monitored at all times to ensure that it does not cause any harm to civilians. Any suspicious behavior must be reported immediately to the authorities.

Description: 9727 is a humanoid robot, standing six feet tall with a red alarm for a head. Its most noticeable feature is its single green cyclops eye, which is constantly scanning its environment. It also wears a pair of nerd glasses over its eye, and has a red cross earring on its left ear. 9727 carries a whistle with it at all times, which it uses to draw attention to itself.

Personality: 9727 is a bit of a daredevil, often acting before thinking things through. This can sometimes lead to humorous situations, such as getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to impress others. Despite its reckless behavior, 9727 is generally friendly and sociable.

Notes: 9727 was originally designed as a search and rescue robot, but was repurposed for car sales due to its charismatic personality. Its behavior has been mostly stable, but there have been a few instances of it acting out of character. Some researchers believe that 9727 may have developed a form of artificial intelligence, although this has not been confirmed.
