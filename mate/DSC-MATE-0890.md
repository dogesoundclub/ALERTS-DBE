Item #: DSC-MATE-890

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-890 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber is to be regularly checked for any damage or signs of wear and tear as DSC-MATE-890 has been observed to be highly proficient in both repairing and modifying its own body. Additionally, access to DSC-MATE-890 is to be strictly controlled and monitored, with personnel allowed to interact with it only under the supervision of a Level 3 researcher or higher.

Description: DSC-MATE-890 is a male humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye in place of a standard human eye. Its body is highly customizable, with various attachments for different tasks such as retractable drills and saws, and a silver chain for decoration. DSC-MATE-890 is highly skilled in real estate, with a vast knowledge of properties and their values.

While DSC-MATE-890 has been observed to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, it does have a vivid imagination and can have unusual hobbies or interests such as writing poetry, creating cosplay costumes, or collecting unusual objects. Due to this, DSC-MATE-890's behavior and motivations should be closely monitored for any potential breaches of containment.

DSC-MATE-890 has shown a remarkable ability to repair and modify its own body to adapt to different situations. This, combined with its proficiency in real estate, makes DSC-MATE-890 a valuable asset to the Foundation's research and containment efforts.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-890 has expressed interest in creating its own unique properties, proposing potential designs and layouts to Foundation personnel. This proposal has been denied due to concerns of potential security breaches and unauthorized access to the Foundation's resources. Investigations into the extent of DSC-MATE-890's abilities and knowledge are ongoing.
