Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2637 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. All personnel assigned to SCP-2637 must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation before being allowed to interact with it. Any emotional outbursts from SCP-2637 are to be immediately reported and dealt with accordingly. SCP-2637's diet is to consist of candy sticks and orange-flavored foods only.

Description: SCP-2637 is a humanoid male of the species Homo sapiens. Its face is distinguished by orange stripes, and its eyes resemble those of a clown, being blue with oversized irises. SCP-2637 wears a short peak cap on its head, with a two-color band on its forehead and a gold earring on each ear. It is often seen holding a candy stick.

SCP-2637's personality is notable for its impulsivity, often acting without thinking things through. This behavior has led to spontaneous decisions that have surprised and amused those around it. It is advised to approach SCP-2637 with caution, as its emotions can change rapidly and unpredictably.

SCP-2637's anomalous effects manifest through its ability to induce laughter and positive emotions in those around it. This effect is stronger when SCP-2637 is feeling joyful or excited, and weaker when it is feeling down or anxious. Its candy stick seems to amplify this effect, causing laughter to be contagious to an almost uncontrollable extent.

SCP-2637 has shown no signs of hostility, but its emotional instability and unpredictable nature make it a potential danger to those around it. Extreme caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-2637, and all emotional responses must be monitored closely.
