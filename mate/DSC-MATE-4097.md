Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4097 is to be contained in a standard humanoid robotic containment cell at all times. Any attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-4097 must be made through advanced artificial intelligence software, as any direct contact may result in injury. Access to DSC-MATE-4097 is prohibited except for authorized personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: DSC-MATE-4097 is a male real estate agent robot with a distinct green Cyclops eye and horned rim glasses. DSC-MATE-4097 also wears a blue bandana on its head, a red cross earring on its left ear, and a medical mask over its mouth. DSC-MATE-4097 is frequently seen sporting a red scarf around its neck, which has been noted to appear dirty and frayed around the edges.

DSC-MATE-4097 is introspective and prone to getting lost in thought, which can lead to some comical accidents. DSC-MATE-4097 has been observed walking into poles and tripping over objects due to its absentmindedness.

DSC-MATE-4097 has not exhibited any anomalous properties beyond its appearance and personality traits. However, caution is advised when interacting with DSC-MATE-4097 due to its unpredictable behavior.

Addendum: Despite initial resistance to containment, DSC-MATE-4097 has quickly become a model inmate. It is recommended that continued efforts be made to engage DSC-MATE-4097 in conversation as a means of improving its mental state and to better understand its motivations and behaviors. Further study is needed to determine if DSC-MATE-4097 has any hidden capabilities or features that may pose a threat to Foundation personnel or the general public.
