Item #: SCP-2163

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2163 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All personnel interacting with SCP-2163 must wear personal protective equipment and remain alert for any indication of its psychic abilities manifesting.

Description: SCP-2163 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, standing at approximately 1.5 meters tall. SCP-2163's most prominent features are its blue clown eyes that seem to have a disconcertingly penetrating gaze. Its frightened mouth and its red victory band on its forehead add to its ominous appearance.

SCP-2163 has been observed to possess a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to predict uncanny events with remarkable accuracy. It has also been known to display telepathic and telekinetic abilities, although these have not been consistently reproduced in observation.

When SCP-2163 detects a person's emotional state, it often attempts to alleviate any negative feelings by interacting with them in a friendly manner. However, its attempts at comfort can come across as intrusive and unwelcome, further adding to its eerie demeanor.

In addition to its psychic abilities, SCP-2163 is frequently observed wearing a gold earring, a gold chain, and smoking a cigarette. These items appear to have no anomalous properties, but they have been determined to be personal accessories of SCP-2163.

SCP-2163 has proven cooperative with Foundation personnel, although it is recommended that all interactions with SCP-2163 be done with extreme caution. The true nature of SCP-2163's abilities has yet to be fully ascertained, and more testing is recommended to better understand the extent of its anomalous properties.
