SCP-3867, designated as "The Curious Delivery Driver", is a human male working in the delivery services industry, with a strange facial feature that sets him apart from other humans. SCP-3867 is known to have a small spot near his mouth, which seems to attract the attention of many bystanders. It has been observed that this spot changes colors and shapes depending on SCP-3867's emotions. When frightened or stressed, SCP-3867's mouth will widen and contort into a ghastly expression, often frightening those nearby.

SCP-3867's head is a typical men's blonde hair with a unique feature, a pair of goggles, which he often wears on his forehead. The goggles have no apparent use but are believed to be part of SCP-3867's personal style. Another unique feature of SCP-3867 is his gold earring, which he wears in his left ear. The origins of this earring are unknown, and SCP-3867 is reluctant to discuss them when asked.

SCP-3867's personality is what sets him apart. Curious and inquisitive, SCP-3867 has a natural inclination towards the unknown and the unusual. Obscure or rare facts and trivia are of great interest to him, and he is known to randomly share bits of information with anyone willing to listen. SCP-3867's personality has led to some humorous situations, and he has become somewhat of a local legend. However, with SCP-3867's peculiar appearance and odd behaviors, it is best to approach him with caution.

SCP-3867's anomalous properties are relatively benign, and he is considered safe for public interaction. However, SCP-3867's curiosity can get the best of him, and it is recommended to keep him away from any significant developments of SCP entities or related materials. SCP-3867 is currently assigned to deliver packages within local boundaries and has shown to be a reliable and efficient member of the SCP Foundation's delivery team.
