Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7656 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not performing her designated job as a fashion designer. SCP-7656 is allowed to leave her chamber to conduct her work, however, she must be accompanied by at least one Level 2 personnel at all times. SCP-7656 is not allowed to gift any clothing items designed and/or manufactured by her to foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-7656 appears to be a Caucasian female in her early twenties. Her face features bright orange stripes similar to those of a tiger and possesses red lips. She always wears a bucket hat on her head and a medical mask covering her mouth. SCP-7656 has gold earrings on both ears and wears a silver chain around her neck. 

SCP-7656's main anomaly is her ability to create clothing designs with extreme precision and attention to detail. She possesses an incredible attention to detail that helps her with the gift-giving aspect of her life. SCP-7656's ability has enabled her to decorate her containment chamber to match her clothing design aesthetics.

SCP-7656 is known to be an overtly concerned gift giver, often obsessing over perfect gift selection for hours at a time. This behavior is typical of their personality, which can make them excellent gift-givers. Foundation personnel should avoid accepting any gifts from SCP-7656, as it is not yet known whether any anomalous effects come with them.

Addendum: SCP-7656 has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, which may be the reason behind her gift-giving obsession. SCP-7656 should be monitored closely to ensure prolonged stability.
