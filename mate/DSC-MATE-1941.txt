Item #: 1941

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1941 is to be kept under standard humanoid containment protocols. The subject may roam within a designated area during working hours, but must be accompanied by a monitoring agent. No hazardous objects are allowed within 5 meters of the subject at any time.

Description: Item 1941 is a young human female, aged approximately 24 years old, standing at 5'5" in height. Item 1941, also known as the "Delivery Driver," has spots on her face along with purple lips, VR jade LED eyes, and witch short hair. The subject wears a gas mask at all times, and is always seen wearing a silver chain necklace and green cross earring.

The subject has a rebellious personality and enjoys pushing boundaries, which can lead to humorous, yet potentially dangerous situations. Item 1941 has been known to intentionally break rules and bend them in order to test the limits of authority.

However, contrary to outward appearances, the subject is able to complete her deliveries on time and maintain a steady work schedule. There have been no reported incidents of injury or harm as a result of the subject's behavior.

Note: Item 1941's employment as a delivery driver may be an asset in future containment and retrieval operations.
