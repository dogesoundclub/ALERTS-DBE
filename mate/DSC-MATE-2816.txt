Item #: SCP-2816

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2816 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Any interactions with SCP-2816 must be monitored and recorded by at least two personnel at all times. SCP-2816 is permitted access to the internet for programming purposes only, with all non-work related websites blocked. Any attempts by SCP-2816 to leave the containment chamber must be met with immediate force.

Description: SCP-2816 is a human male, approximately 27 years old, with red clown eyes and a prominent mouth spot. SCP-2816 has a mohawk hairstyle and a unique two-color band on their forehead. They wear a gold earring in their left ear and a red scarf around their neck. Despite their unusual appearance, SCP-2816 presents themselves as a programmer by profession.

SCP-2816 possesses a personality that is jovial and comedic. They have a great sense of humor and often use it to make others laugh. SCP-2816 is known for telling funny stories and doing silly impersonations, which has been seen to lighten the mood and help alleviate tension among teammates.

However, SCP-2816's behavior can also be unpredictable and volatile. They have been known to go into uncontrollable fits of laughter, sometimes lasting for hours, regardless of the situation or the presence of others. It is suggested that SCP-2816's anomalous nature is linked to their profession as a programmer.

SCP Foundation researchers are continuing to study SCP-2816 to better understand the nature of their anomaly and prevent any potential threats to the public.
