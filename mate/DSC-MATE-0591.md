Item #: 591

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 591 is to be contained within a standard human containment cell, with no access to communication devices or any means of outside contact. All personnel must wear full protective gear, including gas masks and hazmat suits, when entering the containment area due to the subject's LED gas mask. Any attempts by the subject to leave the containment area must be met with full resistance.

Description: Subject 591 appears to be a male theater manager human, standing at approximately 6 feet in height. The subject's most noticeable feature is their mohawk, which is dyed a bright red. The subject wears a gold chain and an LED gas mask at all times, which they refuse to remove. The subject's eyes are clown-like, with a bright red coloration, and their mouth is frequently in a frightened expression.

Subject 591 possesses a strong sense of independence, often refusing help even when it is necessary. This can lead to comical situations where the subject tries to move heavy objects by themselves or gets lost but refuses to use a map. Despite this, the subject has shown to be highly intelligent and resourceful, capable of using their surroundings to their advantage.

While the subject's abilities may seem harmless, their reluctance to cooperate with authorities has led to several incidents of violence and destruction during attempted capture. The subject's motives and potential abilities are currently unknown, but caution should be exercised when dealing with them.

Addendum: Subject 591 was initially apprehended following reports of strange activity at the theater they were managing. Witnesses reported seeing several patrons leave the theater in a panicked state, followed by chaos and destruction inside the building. When authorities arrived at the scene, they found Subject 591 wearing their LED gas mask, standing in the center of the wreckage. Upon apprehension, the subject refused to remove their mask or provide any explanation for their actions. Investigation into the subject's past and potential affiliations is ongoing.
