Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9367 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site 19. No contact with DSC-MATE-9367 outside of approved research is permitted. DSC-MATE-9367's mechanical abilities are to be monitored regularly to prevent the chance of accidental escape.

Description: DSC-MATE-9367 is a female human with orange stripes on her face and orange eyebrow eyes. Her head is not arranged green, and she is often seen wearing a medical mask. On her forehead, DSC-MATE-9367 wears a goggle as an accessory. On her ears, she has green cross earrings, and a gold chain as a necklace.

DSC-MATE-9367's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. She is highly skilled in mechanical repairs and has an impressive ability to fix and build mechanical devices to an almost anomalous degree. Her skills are highly sought after, and it is believed that her anomalous ability is the source of her ability as a mechanic.

DSC-MATE-9367 can be highly stubborn and reluctant to ask for help, even when it is clearly needed. This can lead to humorous situations in which she tries, unsuccessfully, to move heavy furniture or stubbornly refuses to use a map when lost. DSC-MATE-9367 is highly intelligent and resourceful but can be difficult to work with due to her strong will and tendency to ignore protocols.

Addendum: The origin of DSC-MATE-9367's anomalous ability is currently unknown, but it is believed to be related to her mechanical abilities. Further testing is required to determine the source of DSC-MATE-9367's abilities and to assess the potential danger posed by her continued existence.
