Item #: SCP-8144

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8144 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-8144 is limited to Level 2 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-8144 must be supervised.

Description: SCP-8144 is a humanoid figure of the female gender, measuring approximately 5'7" in height. They possess orange stripes on their face, with red clown eyes that seem to change color as they move. SCP-8144's 90s brown hair hangs down to their shoulders, partially obscuring their face. Their most distinct feature is a jade earring on their left ear.

SCP-8144 appears to the outside world as a human car salesman, and can be seen at a car dealership in [REDACTED], USA. SCP-8144's sales tactics are extremely effective, and they have been able to sell cars at an unprecedented rate. Those who purchase cars from SCP-8144 report an extreme sense of satisfaction and happiness, with some reporting that SCP-8144 seemed to know what they wanted before they even knew themselves.

However, it has been discovered that SCP-8144 possesses a dry sense of humor that can be unsettling to those who are not accustomed to it. They have been known to make deadpan jokes that can unsettle and unnerve those around them. Despite this, SCP-8144 never seems to mean any harm, and is generally considered to be harmless.

Interviews with SCP-8144 have revealed that they are not entirely sure of their own abilities, and that they simply wish to make people happy. They are cooperative with Foundation personnel and have not shown any inclination towards violence or resistance.

Addendum: SCP-8144 has been observed speaking to the cars they sell, and appears to have a personal relationship with each one. Further study is required to determine the extent of SCP-8144's anomalous abilities.
