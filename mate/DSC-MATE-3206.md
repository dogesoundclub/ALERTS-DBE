Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3206 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate accommodations for a simian species.

Description: DSC-MATE-3206 is a male simian creature that was discovered working at a fast-food restaurant in [REDACTED]. The subject is approximately 1.2 meters tall and displays a Mohawk hairstyle on its head. DSC-MATE-3206 has a characteristic frightened expression on its mouth and wears typical Nerd Glasses attire.

DSC-MATE-3206's most notable feature is its strong sense of intuition that has been described by some as psychic powers. The subject can predict future events, sense emotions, and detect anxiety and unrest in individuals. In some instances, DSC-MATE-3206's predictions have been eerily accurate, leading researchers to conclude that this ability may pose a significant threat to Foundation secrecy.

DSC-MATE-3206 has been observed wearing a gold chain and a basic gas mask. The significance of these items is currently unknown. DSC-MATE-3206 exhibits a mild level of anxiety in containment but appears to be relatively cooperative.

Addendum: During routine testing, DSC-MATE-3206 predicted an unexpected containment breach in a different sector of the facility, leading to the successful capture of a potentially dangerous entity. This event has led researchers to conclude that DSC-MATE-3206's abilities may be an essential asset for the Foundation in predicting and preventing breaches in the future. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-3206's abilities.
