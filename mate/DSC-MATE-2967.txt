Item #: 2967

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Doctor 2967 is to be given access to medical facilities to aid in her humanitarian efforts. She is allowed to roam unrestricted, provided she is not disrupting Foundation operations. Background checks are to be performed and anyone she treats should be monitored for anomalous symptoms.

Description: 2967 is a human female with a unique appearance. She has numerous spots all over her face that grant her an exotic look. Her eyes are a shocking shade of orange with matching eyebrows, and her head is adorned with a rainbow festival-style wig. On her forehead rests a pair of goggles, and she wears a medical mask over her mouth. Additionally, she has a choker around her neck.

Doctor 2967 is a hands-on, practical individual who will do whatever it takes to fix a problem. She has been known to create unconventional solutions using items such as paperclips or duct tape. In the event of a medical emergency within Foundation containment, she has permission to provide aid to those in need.

Addendum: 2967 has been noted to have a fascination with anomalous medical cases. While her interest in such cases is a potential risk, her humanitarian efforts outweigh her curiosity. However, caution should be taken when discussing anomalous medical conditions with her to prevent accidental breaches in containment.
