Item #: SCP-5451

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5451 is to be allowed freedom of movement within the general population. However, tracking devices must be placed on all vehicles operated by SCP-5451 to track her whereabouts. SCP-5451 is to be monitored by Foundation personnel to ensure that she does not become a security risk.

Description: SCP-5451 is a human female delivery driver with distinctive facial features, including purple lips and VR Jade LED eyes. SCP-5451's overall appearance is styled after 00s school girl fashion, with Jade Earrings as her preferred accessory.

SCP-5451 exhibits a unique personality trait that is potentially anomalous. They demonstrate a deep level of care and nurturing towards the objects in their life, both animate and inanimate. SCP-5451 has been observed to name her personal vehicle, talk to her plants, and anthropomorphize her household appliances. This behavior could indicate an empathetic link or heightened sense of environmental awareness.

There are no known adverse effects caused by SCP-5451's behavior; however, Foundation personnel are to remain vigilant and monitor her activities. SCP-5451's unique personality trait could potentially make her susceptible to manipulation or exploitation by outside entities.

Addendum: SCP-5451 has completed a task successfully by delivering an anomaly to the designated location without detection. SCP-5451 demonstrated herself to be an excellent asset to the Foundation. A status update is needed to evaluate SCP-5451 further.
