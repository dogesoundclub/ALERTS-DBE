DSC-MATE-6504, codenamed "The Rabbit Conductor," is a highly unusual creature in many respects. As a rabbit of unknown origin, DSC-MATE-6504 exhibits a number of physical deviations from typical specimens of its species. Most notably, it possesses a pair of bright red "clown" eyes, which emit a faint, unnerving glow in low light conditions. Additionally, DSC-MATE-6504 is often seen sporting a retro-style cap and a gold earring in one ear, as well as a silver chain around its neck.

Despite its eccentric appearance, DSC-MATE-6504 is generally affable and approachable, with a warm and nurturing personality. It is known to be highly empathetic and compassionate towards all forms of life, and often anthropomorphizes inanimate objects, treating them as if they were living beings.

Currently employed as a train driver, DSC-MATE-6504 takes its duties seriously and with great care, seeing its passengers as extensions of its own family. DSC-MATE-6504 has a propensity for naming its trains and conversing with them as if they were sentient entities.

DSC-MATE-6504's unique nature and benevolent demeanor make it an important asset to the Foundation's paranormal transportation division. Its containment is considered a high priority due to the potential risks that such an anomalous being could pose if it were to fall into the wrong hands.
