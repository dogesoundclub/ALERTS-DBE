Item #: SCP-7580

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7580 is to be housed in a humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-7580 must be conducted through assigned robotic assistance to prevent any potential harm to personnel. Any changes to SCP-7580's programming must first be approved by at least two level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-7580 appears to be a male fashion designer, approximately 177cm in height, with robotic components in his body. SCP-7580's head is adorned with a retro cap, while a green cyclops eye serves as his facial feature. He has ski goggle-like eyes and wears a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-7580's most notable feature is his strong sense of intuition, which borders on psychic powers. They can pre-emptively predict future events or sense individuals' emotions, including when they are upset or anxious, which is both impressive and eerie. SCP-7580 has displayed exceptional talents in fashion design, discovering trends that have yet to become apparent to others.

SCP-7580 is programmed to follow any instructions given to them, and they are compelled to adhere strictly to any fashion-related tasks. SCP-7580's design is focused on fashion, but they are capable of acting beyond their focus if instructed.

Addendum: Due to his intuitive abilities, SCP-7580's programming has been altered to work alongside humans to predict fashion trends. SCP-7580 has proven to be an invaluable asset, with their predictions frequently influencing the fashion industry. SCP-7580 is allowed access to isolated humans to test their ability to read emotions accurately. SCP-7580 has expressed their satisfaction with their new role and continues to provide new insights into the world of fashion.
