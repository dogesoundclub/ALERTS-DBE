Item #: 4825

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4825 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with amenities appropriate for a human subject. As a precautionary measure, all electrical fixtures in SCP-4825's cell are to be inspected and tested regularly. SCP-4825 is allowed access to headphones and other audio equipment upon request, as long as it does not interfere with daily tasks or the safety of personnel.

Description: SCP-4825 is a human female identified as an electrician by previous employment records. Its most notable physical features include orange stripes on the sides of the face and lips painted in a bright shade of red. SCP-4825's eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and it typically wears a hoodie with a 2 color band on the forehead and a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-4825 exhibits high emotional sensitivity and tends to be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. Its fondness for music and art that evoke strong feelings is notable in its behavior. Under usual circumstances, SCP-4825 is docile and cooperative, exhibiting no signs of aggression or hostility towards foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-4825's emotional sensitivity was found to be anomalous in nature during initial testing. A series of electrical impulses generated by SCP-4825's brain was detected when it was exposed to emotionally charged stimuli. This suggests that SCP-4825 has unique electrical patterns in the brain, providing a possible explanation for its profession in the electrical field. Further research is required to uncover the full extent of SCP-4825's abilities.
