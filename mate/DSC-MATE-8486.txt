Item #: SCP-8486

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8486 must be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Personnel interacting with SCP-8486 should refrain from engaging in activities that may cause physical harm to SCP-8486, such as excessive physical exertion or high-risk situations. SCP-8486 is allowed one hour per day of recreational time. Any personnel assigned to SCP-8486's containment must be equipped with LED gas masks at all times while in the same room as SCP-8486.

Description: SCP-8486 is a humanoid male of the species Homo sapiens, standing at approximately 6'2" in height. SCP-8486's most distinct feature is a dark spot located on the left corner of the mouth. SCP-8486 can often be seen wearing nerd glasses and a jade earring in the right ear. SCP-8486 also wears a silver chain around their neck at all times.

SCP-8486's anomalous properties manifest when SCP-8486 engages in activities that require physical exertion. SCP-8486's body appears to emit electrical pulses, allowing it to generate an electric charge. When SCP-8486 is in contact with a conductive material, such as metal or water, the electrical discharge from its body can cause physical harm to nearby individuals or electronic equipment.

SCP-8486 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on tasks that others would shy away from. SCP-8486's nature can lead to humorous situations, as SCP-8486's outgoing personality makes it the life of the party, often getting others to sing or dance along to favorite songs. Despite this, SCP-8486 is aware of its dangerous nature and takes great care to avoid hurting others.

Additional Notes: SCP-8486 was discovered when the Foundation was tipped off about a man causing frequent electrical surges at a local nightclub. SCP agents were able to subdue SCP-8486 and transport it to Site-██ for containment. Testing is ongoing to determine the exact nature of SCP-8486's anomalous properties.
