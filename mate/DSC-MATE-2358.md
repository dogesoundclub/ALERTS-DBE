Addendum-2358-A: Interview Log 2358-A

Dr. ██████: Can you tell us about your motivations for protesting and taking actions against companies or causes that you view as damaging?

DSC-MATE-2358: I believe that the world has become far too corrupt and broken. Greed and capitalism have polluted our society and led to countless social, environmental, and economic issues. Somebody needs to stand up and fight for what's right, and that's what I'm trying to do. I want to make this world a better place, even if it means going against the majority.

Dr. ██████: Can you tell us about how you came to possess your anomalous abilities?

DSC-MATE-2358: I've always been a persuasive person, ever since I was a kid. But over time, my charisma and persuasive abilities grew stronger, to the point where I could sway people's minds without even trying. There's something within me that just connects with people, and I've learned to use that connection to try and make positive changes in people's lives.

Dr. ██████: How can the Foundation assist you in achieving your goals?

DSC-MATE-2358: The Foundation is part of the problem, don't you see that? You work for a corrupt and broken system that perpetuates greed and inequality. If the Foundation truly wants to help people, they should be fighting against the systems that are causing our problems, not trying to control us with your containment protocols.
