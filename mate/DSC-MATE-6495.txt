Item #: SCP-6495

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6495 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, modified to accommodate their physical needs. Due to their species, SCP-6495 is to be provided with climbing structures and other environmental enrichment. Any requests for creative materials must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-6495 is to wear their gas mask at all times when outside of their containment chamber.

Description: SCP-6495 appears to be a male monkey with a distinctive Doge hat on their head and a jade earring in each ear. They wear a silver chain around their neck and a gas mask over their face. SCP-6495 has demonstrated high levels of creativity and frequently engages in a variety of unusual hobbies, including writing poetry, creating cosplay costumes, and collecting peculiar objects. It is unknown whether SCP-6495's creativity is due to their species or related to their anomalous properties.

SCP-6495 is capable of speaking human languages fluently and has demonstrated above-average intelligence for their species. They have proficiency in several programming languages and were employed as a programmer before containment. SCP-6495 has stated that they are willing to assist the Foundation in any way possible, but have expressed frustration with the limitations imposed upon them by their containment.

Addendum: On ██/██/██, SCP-6495 submitted a formal request to be allowed to attend a local cosplay convention. The request was denied due to concerns over a containment breach. SCP-6495 has since become withdrawn and uncooperative, leading to increased monitoring and security measures.
