Item #: SCP-9434

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9434 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with no access to any form of communication or media. All interactions with SCP-9434 are to be recorded and monitored by at least two staff members.

Description: SCP-9434 appears to be a humanoid rabbit wearing a Doge hat with a frightened expression on its mouth. Its eyes are composed of VR Rainbow LED, while its ears have a single gold earring piece. SCP-9434 is always accompanied by a cigarette, which it claims to smoke for stress relief.

SCP-9434 has been identified as a politician, and its species is confirmed to be of the Leporidae family. It is a male, approximately 1.3 meters in height, and weighs 45 kilograms. SCP-9434 has displayed a strong sense of empathy, often feeling and responding to the emotions of others. It has been observed to be quite skilled at comforting others and diffusing tense situations.

Despite its friendly and empathetic personality, SCP-9434 must be kept under strict supervision as it has shown a tendency to sway people's emotions towards its own agenda. Any attempts by SCP-9434 to manipulate individuals must be reported to the senior staff immediately.

Addendum 9434-1:

SCP-9434 has proven to be an asset in negotiations with SCP objects that have shown hostility towards Foundation personnel. Its ability to calm tense situations has proven useful in several containment breaches, and negotiations led by SCP-9434 have produced favorable results. Research into SCP-9434's abilities to manipulate emotions is ongoing.
