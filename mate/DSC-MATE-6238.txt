Item #: 6238

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6238 is to be kept in a secure workshop at Site-██, where it is to be maintained and repaired on a regular basis. Any repairs or upgrades are to be carried out by technicians who are familiar with its systems and programming, and who have received proper training in the handling of robots. Item 6238 should not be allowed to interact with any other anomalous object(s) without explicit approval from Senior Staff.

Description: 

Item 6238 is a humanoid robot, measuring approximately 5' 10'' in height, with a green cyclops-like eye serving as its primary visual input. Its head has not been arranged in a humanoid fashion, but rather resembles a green cube. The robot's primary function is as a mechanic, with an impressive range of tools and devices housed within its upper torso. Its arms and legs are also equipped with a variety of specialized tools, ranging from cutting devices to intricate sensors used for fine-tuning its repairs.

Despite it being a machine, Item 6238 displays a surprisingly human-like personality, characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This aspect of its programming can sometimes cause it to take on more work than is possible, leading it into humorous situations where it foolishly attempts to multitask, or carry too many items at once. 

Addendum: Item 6238 has been observed to exhibit occasional "mood swings" in response to certain stimuli, such as loud noises or unexpected power surges. To prevent potential damage to both the robot and its surroundings, it is recommended that all interactions with Item 6238 be conducted in a calm and non-disruptive manner.
