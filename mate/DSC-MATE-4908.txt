<Begin Log>

Dr. █████: SCP-4908, can you describe your proclivity for impulsive actions?

SCP-4908: Yeah, sure. I just like going with the flow, ya know? Life's too short to be stuck in a rut.

Dr. █████: Do you understand the risks that come with your actions? The potential for harm to yourself or others?

SCP-4908: Of course, man. But sometimes you gotta take risks to experience the thrill of living. Life's boring otherwise.

Dr. █████: I see. Can you describe your work as a mechanic?

SCP-4908: Oh, that's easy. I love fixing up cars, making them run like new. It's like a puzzle, figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it. I'm good with my hands.

Dr. █████: Have you encountered any difficulty with repairing modern machinery?

SCP-4908: Not really, it's all the same principles. But old cars? They've got character. I prefer them, to be honest.

Closing Statement: SCP-4908's impulsive actions and love for taking risks suggest a possible anomalous effect. Further testing is necessary.
