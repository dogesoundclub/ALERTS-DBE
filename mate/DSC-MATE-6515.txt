**SCP-6515: The Lawyer**
 
Object Class: Euclid
 
SCP-6515 is a female human identified as a lawyer. She stands approximately 5'6" tall and is physically fit. Her skin is adorned with distinctive orange stripes, while her hair is concealed under a hoodie. Her most noticeable feature is her electric blue clown eyes that appear to change based on her emotions. SCP-6515 often wears a medical mask to conceal her mouth, although the reason for this is yet to be determined.
 
SCP-6515 possesses a natural talent for leadership that manifests in various situations,i.e., at work, in a social group, or in personal life. Interestingly, the extent of their abilities seems to depend on the circumstance they encounter. More challenging obstacles tend to bring out greater leadership capabilities in SCP-6515.
 
While SCP-6515 presents itself as a charismatic and intelligent individual, it also displays traits of uncontrolled aggression and a lack of empathy. When her leadership is questioned, she will often become violent and engage in what is called a "rage mode." In this mode, SCP-6515 moves faster, hits harder, and exhibits incredible physical strength. Reports indicate that the degree of power displayed in this state varies depending on the duration/type of stimulus that triggered SCP-6515's anger.
 
SCP Foundation notes that SCP-6515 is not to be engaged without proper authorization and confrontation should only be approached with extreme caution. Should SCP-6515 enter their "rage mode," lethal force is authorized as the only viable means of stopping the entity.
