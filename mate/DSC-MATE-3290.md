ID # : DSC-MATE-3290
Description: DSC-MATE-3290 appears to be a humanoid female of average height and weight, with visible orange stripes on its face and a purple lip. The entity also possesses a tiara on its head, jade earrings, and a goggle on its forehead. The most notable feature of DSC-MATE-3290, however, is the LED gas mask it wears at all times. The mask is capable of emitting a highly potent hallucinogen that affects human perception, leaving them susceptible to suggestion and manipulation. DSC-MATE-3290 has reported using the gas mask to influence its customers into purchasing vehicles they would have otherwise not been interested in, often leading them to take out loans beyond their financial capacity.
