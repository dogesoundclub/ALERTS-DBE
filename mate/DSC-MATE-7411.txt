Item #: SCP-7411

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7411 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished with a comfortable bed and reading materials. Access to books and documentaries about various subjects is strongly encouraged for SCP-7411. SCP-7411 is allowed to interact with personnel as long as their research activities are not affected. Any request by SCP-7411 regarding research material must be of importance to prevent deviation from their designated duty.

Description: SCP-7411 is a male humanoid of the species Panthera tigris tigris (Tiger), identified as a train driver by profession. SCP-7411 is 1.76 meters tall and weighs 211 kilograms.

SCP-7411 has a frightened expression on its mouth, common with human or humanoid personnel when they sense danger or threat. SCP-7411's eyes resemble ski goggles, the lenses of which can enable SCP-7411 to see in low-light scenarios while driving. SCP-7411 wears a red beanie on its head, with a goggle attachment, which it uses occasionally to cover its eyes. SCP-7411 has a jade earring on each ear and a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-7411 exhibits an intense desire for knowledge and spends a lot of time reading and researching obscure topics. It enjoys collecting books, documentaries, and other educational resources, and may spend hours discussing its newfound knowledge with others. This curiosity also tends to distract SCP-7411 during his duty as a train driver, and it has shown a tendency to read research material during train stoppages.

SCP-7411's desire to acquire knowledge has surpassed expectations on several occasions. SCP-7411 is cooperative with personnel and readily follows instructions in exchange for access to educational material.

Addendum: SCP-7411 has shown a keen interest in anomalous and paranormal occurrences, though interaction with SCPs is strictly discouraged to prevent breaches. Research materials related to anomalies must be thoroughly vetted by designated personnel and psychologists before being granted to SCP-7411.
