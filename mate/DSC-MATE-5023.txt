SCP-5023, also known as "The Mechanic", is a female Human of medium build and height, aged 36 years, who works as a car salesman. Her most notable physical characteristic is her bright blue clown eyes, which seem to emit a faint, otherworldly glow at all times. SCP-5023 is often seen wearing a retro cap, a choker around her neck, and clutching a cigarette in her hand.

Despite her background in sales, SCP-5023 is a gifted mechanic who possesses an aptitude for fixing almost anything. Her practical and hands-on approach leads her to find unconventional solutions to problems that others find daunting. She is known to use duct tape, paper clips, and other improvised gadgets to repair broken objects or construct new ones. SCP-5023 has a keen sense of ingenuity, often rigging up makeshift solutions despite lacking the proper resources.

In addition to her mechanical skills, SCP-5023 has a peculiar personality. She is known to be frank and unapologetic about her blunt statements, which can sometimes come off as rude or impolite. SCP-5023 tends to be pragmatic and to the point, without any regard for social norms or niceties. She seems to be perpetually smirking, as if she is always in on a joke that nobody else can understand.

Observation of SCP-5023 is necessary to determine the extent of her abilities and any potential anomalous properties. Under no circumstances should SCP-5023 be allowed access to advanced technology or machinery until such properties are verified.
