Item #: SCP-5050

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5050 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The LED gas mask worn by SCP-5050 is to be secured at all times to prevent unauthorized use. Any lost or forgotten items caused by SCP-5050's scatterbrained behavior are to be retrieved and destroyed to prevent potential anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-5050 is a human female in their early thirties, standing at approximately 5’5” tall with a medium build. Their face features orange stripes and an orange eyebrow that contrasts with their metallic blue head. A two-color band can be seen on their forehead, and they wear a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-5050 also wears a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-5050 is a car salesman by profession and can be very persuasive with their words. They have a tendency to easily forget appointments and get sidetracked easily, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-5050's anomalous effect causes any objects they lose or forget to become imbued with an unpredictable power upon retrieval.

Addendum: Incident Report 5050-1: On 10/2/20██, SCP-5050 misplaced a set of car keys that they were supposed to deliver to a customer. After the keys were retrieved, the customer reported that their car now possessed the ability to spontaneously combust. The car was confiscated and destroyed to prevent further anomalous incidents. SCP-5050 was reprimanded and has since been transferred to a containment chamber.
