Item #: 5444

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5444 is to be allowed free movement within the designated containment area, which is a small theater currently leased by the Foundation. Subject 5444 must be monitored at all times by at least two personnel. In the event of a containment breach, personnel are advised to approach with caution, as the subject has been known to exhibit unpredictable behavior.

Description: Subject 5444 is a female human of indeterminate age, although she is estimated to be in her mid-thirties. She stands at approximately 5'6" and has a slight build. Her most notable feature is her blue clown eyes, which are often described as unsettling.

Subject 5444 is typically found wearing a tiara on her head, as well as a two-color band and a goggle on her forehead. She also sports a red cross earring in each ear. Her personality is best described as scatterbrained and easily distracted, often forgetting important appointments or losing her way when attempting to navigate to new locations.

Despite her tendency towards forgetfulness, Subject 5444 is an accomplished theater manager, and the Foundation has found her to be a valuable asset in managing the containment of other anomalous entities. Personnel have noted that she seems to enjoy her work, often going above and beyond what is required of her.

Addendum: Subject 5444 has recently expressed an interest in exploring other areas of the Foundation, particularly those involving containment and research. Further evaluations are being conducted to determine if she would be a suitable candidate for cross-departmental work.
