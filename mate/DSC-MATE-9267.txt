Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9267 is currently contained within a walled enclosure at Site-19. The enclosure must be supplied with fruit trees and other vegetation to maintain the nutritional needs of SCP-9267. The subject is to be monitored via CCTV at all times during waking hours.

Description: SCP-9267 is a male monkey, resembling a Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) with clown-like red eyes. SCP-9267 presents a distinctive fashion style, frequently wearing a purple cap with a headset, a jade earring, and silver chains. Additionally, SCP-9267 is often seen with an LED gas mask, which is believed to regulate the subject's respiration.

SCP-9267 exhibits a keen intellect and a curious personality, always seeking to expand its knowledge by reading and researching obscure topics. SCP-9267 seems to have a near-obsessive passion for collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials. SCP-9267 can be persuasive in sharing its newfound knowledge with others, often lecturing them in great detail.

SCP-9267 was first discovered on a family-owned farm in rural Oklahoma, where it was observed to be operating its farm to sustain its diet. The owner of the farm reported that SCP-9267 had looted and read a number of books on agriculture from the nearby library, thereby acquiring the knowledge necessary to manage the farm. SCP-9267 was acquired by the Foundation shortly thereafter.

Addendum: SCP-9267 recently expressed an interest in studying human anatomy, citing the works of Gray's Anatomy as a possible starting point. As SCP-9267 has yet to show any signs of violent behavior, it has been approved for supervised access to medical textbooks for educational purposes only. The team responsible for monitoring SCP-9267 is advised to maintain a high level of vigilance in case of any unexpected changes in the subject's behavior.
