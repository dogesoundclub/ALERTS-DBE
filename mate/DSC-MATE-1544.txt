Item #: SCP-1544

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1544 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. A medical mask must be worn at all times and physical contact with SCP-1544 is strictly prohibited without express permission from at least three Level 4 personnel. SCP-1544's work as a fashion designer is to be monitored, and any creations showing anomalous properties must be confiscated and contained immediately.

Description: SCP-1544 appears as a male human with a mouth spot and a constant smile. Their eyes are blue clown eyes and their head is made of a metallic purple material. SCP-1544 wears a jade earring and a silver chain, both of which have tested negative for any anomalous properties.

SCP-1544 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and can easily pick up on the emotions of others. This has led to SCP-1544 developing a keen sense of humor, often being able to diffuse tense situations with a well-timed joke or helping others to see the humor in an otherwise difficult situation.

SCP-1544 shows no signs of aggression or hostility and has been cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, due to their anomalous appearance and abilities, SCP-1544's potential impact on the general public must be closely monitored.

Addendum: SCP-1544 has recently gained notoriety in the fashion industry for their unique designs, which often incorporate non-traditional materials and colors. Foundation agents have been tasked with keeping a close eye on SCP-1544's creations to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the general public. Any anomalous creations are to be confiscated and contained immediately.
