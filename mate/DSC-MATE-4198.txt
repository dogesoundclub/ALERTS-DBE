Description: SCP-4198 appears to be a human female in her mid-twenties. However, several anomalous features have been observed. SCP-4198's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, which appear to be functional and have been observed rotating in a non-random pattern. The left side of SCP-4198's head is colored orange, while the right side appears to be normal.

SCP-4198's left ear is adorned with a green cross earring, while the right ear appears to be normal. SCP-4198's mouth is usually covered with a medical mask, which it wears at all times. SCP-4198 also wears a black choker around its neck.

SCP-4198 is the leader of a notorious Mafia in ██████, which its gang is responsible for numerous crimes, including but not limited to; Human Trafficking, Drug Traficking, and Murder, in several countries around the world. SCP-4198's behavior has been described as erratic, and it appears to be a bit scatterbrained. SCP-4198 has been known to forget important appointments or get sidetracked quickly. SCP-4198's unpredictable behavior makes it difficult to fully understand its motives and activities.

Addendum: In 20██, SCP-4198 was discovered in ████████, where it had been conducting operations for several years. Foundation agents managed to apprehend SCP-4198 without incident and brought it into custody without alerting its organization. Since its incarceration, SCP-4198 has made several attempts to communicate with Foundation personnel, claiming that it holds valuable information about a potential XK-class end-of-the-world scenarios. SCP-4198's claims are highly dubious, however, given the nature of its organization and the behaviors it has displayed, researchers should adhere to the strict containment protocols.
