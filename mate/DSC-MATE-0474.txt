Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-474 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a standard monitor and observation suite. All interactions with SCP-474 must be closely monitored and supervised by at least one Level 2 researcher. Any requests made by SCP-474 must go through proper channels and be approved by no less than two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-474 is a male human standing 1.8 meters tall and weighing 72.5 kilograms. SCP-474's most notable feature is the presence of numerous spots along his body, from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. Additionally, SCP-474's eyes appear to be a pair of ski goggles, and his hair is styled in a sharp, pointed spike. SCP-474 is often seen sporting a silver chain and carrying a cigarette.

SCP-474 is a highly ambitious individual, known for their goal-oriented nature, and often taking on more than they can handle. SCP-474's strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills have allowed him to pull off such tasks successfully. However, these traits have led to a tendency towards aggression, and SCP-474 has a history of lashing out when under stress.

SCP-474's occupation as a fashion designer lends itself well to these traits, allowing for the creation of elaborate collections and stunning pieces. SCP-474 has been known to go to extreme lengths to acquire the necessary materials and resources for their projects, often leading to ethical concerns.

SCP-474 has been observed to manipulate those around him to achieve his goals, often using charm and flattery to get what he wants. Despite this behavior, SCP-474 has shown a degree of loyalty to those who prove themselves useful to their ambitions.

Addendum: Following Incident-474-01, all personnel are reminded to keep a watchful eye on SCP-474's behavior as the subject can be unpredictable when under extreme stress. Further evaluations and additional containment measures may be necessary.
