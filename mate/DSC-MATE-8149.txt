SCP-8149, also known as "The Empath", is a female human and the current head of the notorious mafia organization known as the Red Cross. Despite her criminal activities, SCP-8149 possesses a unique ability to feel the emotions of those around her with extreme intensity. This has earned her a reputation as a ruthless and unpredictable leader, one that her subordinates fear and respect in equal measure.

SCP-8149 stands out with her vibrant appearance, sporting bright blue clown eyes that seem to penetrate the soul of anyone who dares to make eye contact with her. Her short witch-like hair and red cross earring add to her distinctive style, while her lips are always painted a bold shade of red. Perhaps most notable about her appearance is the medical mask she wears, which she claims is necessary due to her hypersensitivity to the emotions of others.

Despite her callous criminal activities, SCP-8149 has a tender side to her personality. She possesses a deep empathy and understanding for others, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when she witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. She also has a fondness for animals and nature, known to take in stray dogs and cats and care for them herself.

Approaching SCP-8149 is not recommended unless authorized by Foundation personnel with extensive training in dealing with emotionally-charged situations. Her ability to read and manipulate the emotions of others make her a formidable adversary, and one that should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, her unique abilities have also made her a valuable asset to the Foundation, who continue to monitor her closely.
