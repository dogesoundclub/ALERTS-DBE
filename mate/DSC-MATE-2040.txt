Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2040 is to be contained in a secure chamber measuring 5m x 5m at Site-██. Any interaction with SCP-2040 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2040 is a male adult tiger, measuring approximately 2.5m in length and weighing approximately 300kg. SCP-2040 has red clown eyes, which emit an unknown type of aura, causing affected individuals to experience feelings of unease and anxiety. SCP-2040 also bears a doge hat and a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-2040's mouth is usually covered with a medical mask, which it periodically removes to eat.

SCP-2040's most notable attribute is its impulsive personality. SCP-2040 often acts on its emotions, resulting in sudden or unexpected responses. The entity has a tendency to make spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising, even in threatening situations.

Addendum: SCP-2040 was captured by the Foundation in ████████, following reports of a tiger attacking civilians. Upon capture, SCP-2040 exhibited signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel, leading to the use of tranquilizers. Further research on SCP-2040's behavior is ongoing.
