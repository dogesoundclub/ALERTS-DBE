Item #: 4735

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4735 is to be monitored through regular check-ins and a GPS tracker at all times during work hours. SCP-4735 is allowed to continue working as a delivery driver for the safety and growth of the local economy. In the event of a containment breach, a tranquilizer has been provided to subdue SCP-4735.

Description: SCP-4735 is a male tiger that stands at a height of 1.8 meters and weighs approximately 330 pounds. SCP-4735 mainly wears a purple cap with a headset, a medical mask, and a silver chain. The tiger's mouth appears frightened, likely a result of their forgetfulness and absent-mindedness. SCP-4735's ears are adorned with a single red cross earring. The tiger's forehead features a two-color band, primarily dark blue and silver.

SCP-4735's personality is largely friendly but can be forgetful and absent-minded. When lost in thought or working on a project, SCP-4735's mind wanders, leading to humorous situations such as forgetting appointments or losing track of time.

Addendum: Despite initial fears, no incidents have been reported with SCP-4735 since initial containment, leading the Foundation to believe SCP-4735 does not pose a threat to human life or security. Further studies will be conducted.
