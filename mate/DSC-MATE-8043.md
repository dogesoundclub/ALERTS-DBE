Object Class: Euclid

Description: DSC-MATE-8043 is a robotic entity measuring 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 45 kilograms. It exhibits a humanoid form with a retro cap and a jade earring on its ears. The most prominent feature on its face is a single green cyclops eye, which may emit a beam of energy capable of disrupting electronic devices. The entity also wears a pair of nerd glasses and a goggle on its forehead. DSC-MATE-8043 often carries an LED gas mask, which obscures its face and may provide additional sensory input.

DSC-MATE-8043's personality is characterized by an insatiable curiosity about the world and its workings. The entity has an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure and unusual topics, which it may randomly spout off to others. DSC-MATE-8043's fixation with knowledge and experimentation has led it to engage in increasingly dangerous and unethical activities, making it a threat to human safety.

Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8043 is to be kept in a specialized humanoid containment unit, which shall include several reinforced walls fitted with electromagnetic shielding to interfere with the entity's energy beam. The unit will be monitored by several security cameras and patrolled regularly by armed guards. DSC-MATE-8043's gas mask must be kept in containment at all times, as it has exhibited the ability to modify the properties of the air around it when worn.

Interaction with DSC-MATE-8043 is to be kept at a minimum. All experiments conducted with the entity must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel and carry a Class D personnel to perform research.

In the event of a security breach or attempted escape, security personnel are authorized to use lethal force if necessary.
