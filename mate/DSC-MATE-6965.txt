Item #: SCP-6965

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6965 is to be housed in a secure garage within Site-███. The garage is to be equipped with a charging station and repair tools suitable for its species. SCP-6965 is allowed regular access to its repair tools but is not to be allowed contact with any other anomalous objects without prior written approval from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-6965 is a mechanical humanoid entity of roughly human size, with an outer casing of various metals and polymers. Its appearance is that of a male human, with VR rainbow LED eyes, a red beanie, and a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-6965 habitually wears a red scarf and often carries a lit cigarette in its "mouth".

SCP-6965 is capable of conversations with humans, and has developed a wry, humorous personality throughout its time as a mechanic. It is proficient in several languages and is capable of understanding complex work processes involving mechanical equipment.

SCP-6965 has a tendency towards forgetfulness, particularly when it is lost in thought or focused on a project. This trait can lead to mild, humorous situations, such as SCP-6965 forgetting appointments or losing track of time and missing important events. Despite this, SCP-6965 is a valuable member of the team and is regarded as one of the best mechanics on site.

Addendum: SCP-6965 has developed a particular attachment to its repair tools and has been observed talking to them, particularly when working on difficult projects. Requests for SCP-6965 to teach other Foundation personnel advanced repair techniques have been unanimously denied, as the possibility that such knowledge could be used for nefarious purposes cannot be completely discounted. Any unauthorized contact with SCP-6965's repair tools is strictly forbidden.
