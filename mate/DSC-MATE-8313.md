Item #: DSC-MATE-8313

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8313 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with ample room for its needs. Accessory #1 and #2 are not to be removed from its possession unless directed by Level 4 personnel. To ensure the containment integrity, all individuals entering the cell must wear protective gear to avoid exposure to DSC-MATE-8313's anomalies.

Description: DSC-MATE-8313 is a male monkey, identified as a member of the species Macaca mulatta, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. DSC-MATE-8313's notable features include its bright red clown eyes that appear to glow under low-light conditions, a partially shaved and dyed pink head, and the presence of silver chain and candy stick that it carries around with it at all times.

DSC-MATE-8313 speaks fluent English and displays a highly developed sense of humor, which usually involves making others laugh through amusing anecdotes or comical impersonations. DSC-MATE-8313's comedic abilities often lead to humorous situations, although caution should be exercised as its humor can also be mischievous, bordering on dangerous.

DSC-MATE-8313's anomalous nature becomes apparent when it uses its candy stick accessory. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the candy stick has the ability to instantly transform the substance it touches into a confectionery of identical shape and size. Though the mechanism of this effect is unclear, it has been observed that DSC-MATE-8313 can use this ability repeatedly without any apparent sign of fatigue or harm.

Despite its useful abilities, DSC-MATE-8313 still has an unpredictable nature and requires constant monitoring to avoid any accidental harm or containment breach. Any personnel tasked with interacting with DSC-MATE-8313 must undergo basic clown training to prevent arousing any negative emotions within DSC-MATE-8313, which could result in aggressive behavior.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8313 was observed to be distressed and unresponsive to stimulus. After numerous tests and assessments, it was discovered that accessory #2, the candy stick, had been missing for over a month. Upon its safe retrieval, DSC-MATE-8313 quickly resumed its jovial disposition, and the incident was concluded with all due care.
