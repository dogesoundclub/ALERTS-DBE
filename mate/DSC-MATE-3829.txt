Item #: 3829

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3829 is to be monitored during all public appearances as a news anchor. Any deviations from expected behavior should be reported to a supervisor immediately. Interviews with SCP-3829 are to be conducted in a well-lit room with at least one additional security personnel present. SCP-3829 is not to be given access to any tools or materials that could be used to repair or build objects without prior approval.

Description: SCP-3829 appears to be a human male in his mid-forties with distinct facial features. He possesses a "mouth spot" located on the upper lip, which is a raised, discolored patch of skin. His eyes resemble a pair of ski goggles and are always worn indoors and outdoors. SCP-3829's head is visible with parted pink hair that could be dyed. SCP-3829 has a green cross earring inserted to each earlobe which is removable. SCP-3829 is always seen with a red scarf draped over his shoulders and prefers to wear clothing of this color scheme.

SCP-3829's personality is described as hands-on and practical, frequently utilizing unconventional methods to solve problems. SCP-3829's tendency to use duct tape, paper clips, or other makeshift solutions often surprises and confounds those around him. While there is no evidence that SCP-3829 possesses any anomalous or paranormal abilities, his resourcefulness, and quick-thinking may indicate an above-average intellect.

SCP-3829's job as a news anchor does not appear to have any anomalous qualities, but precautions should be taken to ensure that he does not obtain access to any reporting materials or equipment without prior approval.

Addendum: Several interview transcripts with SCP-3829 indicate that he is aware of the Foundation's existence and has expressed interest in joining. Requests of such membership are to be denied, and he is to be monitored for any potential breaches of protocol.
