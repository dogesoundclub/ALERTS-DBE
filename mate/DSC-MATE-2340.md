ID # : DSC-MATE-2340
Description: DSC-MATE-2340 is a human female in her early 40s. She stands 1.67 meters tall and weighs approximately 65 kilograms. DSC-MATE-2340's face features a number of spots, likely attributed to mild freckling. She often wears a smile, and normal glasses that she rest upon the top of her nose, never allowing them to sit just right. Her hair is arranged into two pig tails on either side of her head. Across her forehead lies a two-color band, which DSC-MATE-2340 claims to be a family heirloom, but does not elaborate further. DSC-MATE-2340 adorns her ears with simple gold earrings. She is often seen smoking a cigarette, which she never allows to burn less than half its length.
