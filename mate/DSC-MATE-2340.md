Item #: DSC-MATE-2340

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2340 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access for interviews or consultations must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-2340 is allowed to continue her profession as a lawyer, but is not permitted to represent Foundation personnel or divulge any confidential information.

Description: DSC-MATE-2340 is a human female in her early 40s. She stands 1.67 meters tall and weighs approximately 65 kilograms. DSC-MATE-2340's face features a number of spots, likely attributed to mild freckling. She often wears a smile, and normal glasses that she rest upon the top of her nose, never allowing them to sit just right. Her hair is arranged into two pig tails on either side of her head. Across her forehead lies a two-color band, which DSC-MATE-2340 claims to be a family heirloom, but does not elaborate further. DSC-MATE-2340 adorns her ears with simple gold earrings. She is often seen smoking a cigarette, which she never allows to burn less than half its length.

DSC-MATE-2340 is quite reliable and organized, making her an effective lawyer. DSC-MATE-2340 can also be quite stubborn and has a hard time letting go of her routines or accepting new ideas. This has caused her to be less effective in her job at times and makes her ill-equipped for unexpected changes or challenges. DSC-MATE-2340 has shown no anomalous abilities or properties, however it is noted that there is an abnormal amount of trust that many hold in her. Further study regarding this correlation is needed.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2340's abilities provided valuable assistance in containment procedures for DSC-████ when she successfully negotiated with the opposing party to drop all charges against Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-2340's value as a legal consultant should not be overlooked.
