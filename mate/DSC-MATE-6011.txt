Item #: SCP-6011

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6011 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with basic amenities for a rabbit creature. Its living space must be kept tidy, and it should be provided with a varied diet of vegetables and fruits. No personnel are allowed to approach SCP-6011 unless authorized by Level 3 security clearance, in order to prevent contamination. 

Description: SCP-6011 appears the same as an average brown rabbit, with the exception of its clown-like red eyes that give off a feeling of intense discomfort. Its mouth is always in a frightened position, further adding to its unsettling appearance. SCP-6011's forehead features two colored bands that circle its forehead in a retro cap, creating a decorative effect. It wears a red scarf and carries a whistle that it uses to alert its keepers if it feels uncomfortable or scared. 

SCP-6011 has a highly observant and detail-oriented personality, making it an excellent reporter that unearths hidden truths in even the most challenging situations. However, its tendency to worry about gift-giving and overthink what to give others can cause it stress and anxiety. 

SCP-6011's origins are unknown, and it has no natural predator, making it a rare and valuable specimen for study. SCP-6011 is not naturally aggressive, but its reactions can be unpredictable when confronted with unfamiliar surroundings or people. 

SCP-6011 was initially discovered in a small town after multiple reports of strange occurrences that were later linked to its presence. SCP-6011 was subsequently apprehended and transferred to Foundation care, where it has since been studied extensively. 

Addendum: Despite SCP-6011's docile nature and lack of aggression, Level 4 personnel recommend caution when communicating with it, warning against anthropomorphizing it, as it remains a highly unpredictable creature.
