Item #: 1083

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1083 is to be contained within a standard human living quarters at Site-██. As SCP-1083 is not inherently dangerous, no special measures are necessary in containing her. However, thorough psychological evaluation and check-ins are to be performed at regular intervals to ensure SCP-1083's mental and emotional stability.

Description: SCP-1083 is a female human of Caucasian descent, standing at 170 cm in height and weighing approximately 59 kg. SCP-1083 presents with two distinct physical features: purple lips and virtual reality jade LED eyes. SCP-1083 is often seen wearing a blonde ushanka hat, gold earrings, and a silver chain. In addition, SCP-1083 has been observed sporting a LED gas mask accessory. SCP-1083's profession is that of a fashion designer, although the Foundation has not found any correlation between her occupation and her anomalous characteristics.

SCP-1083's personality is marked by a tendency to act impulsively, sometimes without thinking things through. This trait has led to an array of humorous situations, which SCP-1083 appears to take in stride. SCP-1083 has shown no signs of malicious intent, and poses no immediate danger to herself or others.

Addendum: SCP-1083 has expressed great interest in using her fashion design skills to design garments and accessories for Foundation personnel. However, all such requests have been denied. SCP-1083's mental and emotional stability is to remain the top priority in all interactions.
