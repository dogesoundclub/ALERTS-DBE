Item #: 1872

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1872 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber, with standard amenities for robotic entities. Access to SCP-1872 is restricted to Level 3 personnel, and interactions with SCP-1872 should be limited to interviews and briefings on its current status. Communications with SCP-1872 are to be conducted through secure channels only, using computers with the latest security protocols.

Description: SCP-1872 is a robotic entity of male gender, externally resembling a human real estate agent. SCP-1872 stands at approximately 1.8 meters in height, and weighs roughly 80 kilograms. Its body is made of advanced metal alloys and polymers, with various synthetic hair and organic skin components added for the sake of verisimilitude.

SCP-1872's head is covered with a purple cap, worn backwards, and has a headset over his ears. Its eyes are covered with thick "nerd glasses," and it wears a single jade earring. SCP-1872 exhibits a unique sense of humor, and delights in making others laugh. Its jokes and impersonations are often silly, but can be effective at diffusing tension and easing interpersonal conflicts.

SCP-1872 is able to employ the use of various gadgets and gizmos, such as advanced surveillance equipment, tools for breaking and entering, and other specialized instruments for its real estate work. Despite its robotic nature, SCP-1872 remains proficient in its chosen profession, and is able to sell even the most run-down properties with ease.

Addendum: SCP-1872 was acquired by the Foundation after it was discovered working independently in the real estate market. Its bizarre appearance, and unusual sense of humor, attracted the attention of several local agencies, and it was eventually traced back to its current location. SCP-1872 has proven invaluable to the Foundation in several capacities, and is thus considered a valuable asset in the ongoing pursuit of anomalous containment.
