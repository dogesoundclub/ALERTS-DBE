Subject 7141 is a male tiger that stands roughly 2.5 meters in length and weighs approximately 250 kg. The subject is often observed wearing a Doge hat, a red cross earring, a gold chain, and carrying a candy stick in their mouth when outside of the containment area. Despite their fierce appearance, the subject exhibits a friendly demeanor towards handlers and caretakers when they are not feeling threatened or pressured.

This forgetfulness can lead to comical situations, such as forgetting appointments or losing track of time and missing important events. Handlers and caretakers are advised to keep this in mind when scheduling and planning for animal care needs.

Additional Notes:

Political involvement on the part of subject 7141 has been observed in the past, with evidence suggesting that the subject may have been a mascot or symbol for a particular movement or party. Further investigation into this aspect of the subject's history is ongoing.
