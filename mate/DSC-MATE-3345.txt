Item #: 3345

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3345 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to a small, enclosed outdoor area for exercise. Personnel are required to wear gas masks when entering the chamber, as SCP-3345 exhibits a strong odor reminiscent of feline urine. SCP-3345's gas mask is not to be removed under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-3345 appears to be a male Siberian tiger in his late 20s or early 30s, measuring approximately 7 feet in length and weighing 500 pounds. SCP-3345 has a distinctive appearance, with green hair in a purple cap and a single gold earring in its left ear. The tiger's eyes are currently unknown, as SCP-3345 insists on wearing its normal gas mask at all times.

SCP-3345's primary anomalous property is its ability to assume the form of a human male, revealing its true form only to those it trusts. SCP-3345's human form is that of a Caucasian male with similar green hair and typically wears a red scarf in the same fashion as its tiger form. SCP-3345's gas mask is also a common accessory in its human form.

SCP-3345 works as a reporter for an unknown news organization and has demonstrated a high level of skill in investigative journalism. SCP-3345's personality is friendly and outgoing, but prone to forgetfulness and absent-mindedness. This has led to several humorous incidents, but SCP-3345 has never put itself or others in danger due to its forgetfulness.

Addendum: SCP-3345 has expressed interest in using its investigative skills to aid the Foundation in acquiring information on anomalous entities and objects. Requests for assistance from SCP-3345 may be granted on a case-by-case basis, pending approval from the Site Director.
