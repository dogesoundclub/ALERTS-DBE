Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8950 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times unless authorized for release by Level 4 personnel. Any requests by DSC-MATE-8950 to participate in creative activities must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-8950 is a monkey of the male sex, wearing nerd glasses and a jade earring on its left ear. It typically fashions a gold chain around its neck and carries a whistle as an accessory. Most notable is its head's black hair, seemingly normal for its species. DSC-MATE-8950 is a firefighter but appears to be highly imaginative, enjoying a wide range of interests, from poetry to cosplay to collecting unusual objects.

DSC-MATE-8950 displays a vivid imagination, unique to its species. They have been found engaging in various creative activities while in containment, such as painting, writing, and crafting unique costumes. DSC-MATE-8950's hobbies are benign and not hazardous. While there have been no direct indications that DSC-MATE-8950 poses a threat, it should be noted that their behavior may unpredictably vary, and their level of imagination has somewhat distorted their perception of reality.

Addendum: Dr. ██████, who has observed DSC-MATE-8950 on multiple occasions, has advocated for the normalization of more creative activities to further aid in the containment of DSCs. Dr. ██████'s suggestion will be considered by Foundation leadership.
