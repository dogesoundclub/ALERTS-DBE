Item #: 7418

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 
SCP-7418 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with a reinforced steel door. Access to SCP-7418 requires two Level 2 clearance personnel, and all interactions must be supervised by at least one Security Officer. SCP-7418 has expressed a desire to continue its job as a firefighter, which has been granted on the condition that it does not disclose its anomalous properties to any non-Foundation personnel. 

Description:
SCP-7418 appears as an anthropomorphic tiger, standing at 6'7" and weighing approximately 315 lbs. Its mouth is often contorted in a fearful expression, and it wears a pair of horn-rimmed glasses over its piercing, green eyes. SCP-7418 has been observed wearing a police cap and a pair of goggles on its forehead, as well as a gold earring, silver chain and an LED gas mask. 

SCP-7418 exhibits a compassionate and empathetic personality, often feeling responsible for the well-being of those around it. This can lead to SCP-7418 taking on the problems of others, which can be both admirable and potentially dangerous. SCP-7418's desire to help others has been directed towards its chosen profession as a firefighter, which coincidentally provides it with ample opportunity to assist others.  

Addendum:
During the course of SCP-7418's containment, it has expressed a desire to gain more knowledge of the supernatural world, including other anomalous entities. It is recommended that further education on this topic be provided, as it may assist in the containment and understanding of other SCP objects in the future.
