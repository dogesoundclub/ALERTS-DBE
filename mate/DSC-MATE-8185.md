Item #: DSC-MATE-8185

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8185 is to be kept in an isolated room away from any metal or artificial materials. It must not interact with any electrical devices without direct supervision from Level 3 personnel or above. All personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-8185 must wear noise-cancelling headphones to avoid any hostile behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-8185 is a robotic humanoid with a height of 1.8 meters and a weight of approximately 67 kilograms. The entity possesses one Cyclops green eye in the center of its forehead, which exhibits a unique ability to emit a laser beam. DSC-MATE-8185 also wears horned rim glasses over its cyclops eye for better accuracy.

DSC-MATE-8185's head is covered with a red beanie and a goggle on its forehead, which is stationary and does not appear to serve any functional purpose. The entity is usually seen wearing a red scarf wrapped around its neck and a whistle hanging from its neck for emergency situations.

The robot's personality is characterized as introspective and lost in thought, making it difficult to communicate with. DSC-MATE-8185 tends to spend a lot of time daydreaming and may find itself in humorous situations like unintentionally walking into a pole or tripping over objects due to absent-mindedness.

DSC-MATE-8185 claims to be a lawyer, but there is no verifiable evidence of its credentials. Its grasp of the English language is impressive, and it frequently engages in debates over various subjects.

DSC-MATE-8185's offensive capabilities are formidable due to its Cyclops eye laser, but its introspective nature makes it largely uninterested in combat. The potential for hostile behavior, however, cannot be entirely ruled out.

Addendum: Following Incident 8185-A, DSC-MATE-8185 is to be kept under closer surveillance due to a sudden increase in hostility during a cognitive assessment. All interactions with the entity must be logged and evaluated by Level 3 personnel or above.
