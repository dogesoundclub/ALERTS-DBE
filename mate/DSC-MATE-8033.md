Description: DSC-MATE-8033 is a male rabbit in the guise of a human. It measures approximately 1.5 meters in height and weighs approximately 40 kilos. DSC-MATE-8033 wears a red beanie on its head and jade earrings on its long, floppy ears. Its eyes are equipped with advanced VR jade LED technology capable of analyzing and processing vast amounts of data in real time.

DSC-MATE-8033 has a very outgoing and social personality, enjoying being the center of attention. It may amuse itself and others by telling stories or jokes so hilarious that it induces uncontrollable fits of laughter. However, this personality can rapidly switch to one of fright or panic, leading to DSC-MATE-8033 being unable to communicate or respond to direct orders.

DSC-MATE-8033's appearance and behavior have led many to underestimate its true abilities. It possesses an advanced empathic and telepathic ability, allowing it to influence the thoughts and emotions of human beings within a certain range. DSC-MATE-8033's ability to use this power is currently unclear.

Foundation agents traced the origin of the disturbance to DSC-MATE-8033's delivery van and apprehended DSC-MATE-8033. Its attempts to escape custody have been met with force, with no casualties so far. Interrogation of DSC-MATE-8033 has so far been unsuccessful in determining its origins or motives.
