Item #: 1812

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1812 is to be contained within a standard human living environment. Her possessions are to be monitored for any anomalous activity. Any out-of-the-ordinary occurrences are to be reported to Site-██ immediately for further investigation.

Description: Subject 1812 appears to be a female human, with distinct facial features. Noted features include several spots on her face, a prominent purple lip, and unsettling red clown eyes. A two-color band sits upon her forehead, with jade earrings decorating her unnaturally pointed ears. Subject 1812 is often seen wearing a choker necklace and an LED gas mask.

Personality wise, subject 1812 displays a strong sense of independence and a reluctance to ask for help, even in times of need. Despite this, 1812 possesses a strange humor, often stubbornly refusing assistance that would make tasks easier for her. Reports suggest she has been seen struggling to move heavy furniture alone, and refusing the aid of GPS and maps, even when lost.

Addendum: Subject 1812 has been observed to have exceptional skills in legal matters, warranting her a position as a lawyer. Investigations suggest that 1812 may have used anomalous abilities to manipulate the courts in the past. Further research is needed to confirm this suspicion.
