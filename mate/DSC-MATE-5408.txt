Item #: 5408

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5408 is to be monitored at all times and should be contained within a limited area at all times. Interaction with SCP-5408 should only be handled by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. SCP-5408's cravings for attention must not be entertained, and contact with the outside world must be kept to an absolute minimum.

Description: SCP-5408 is a male monkey who holds the title of Politician. SCP-5408 appears to possess an addictive personality and is seen wearing horned rim glasses with green hair in a purple cap. SCP-5408's accessories include a silver chain around their neck and a cigarette in their mouth. SCP-5408 has one Jade earring on their right ear, which was designated by the containment team as a potential point of entry for a tracking device.

SCP-5408 presents confident and bold behaviors when it comes to meeting and interacting with others. Their sense of duty and responsibility is noteworthy; however, they tend to let themselves loose in social events, leading to situations that are not appropriate for their position.

SCP-5408 has shown surprising dance moves and silly antics in the past, much to the amusement of others around. SCP-5408's behavior can be both entertaining and concerning, especially when it comes to personal and professional interactions.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5408's position and access to sensitive information, it was deemed necessary to limit their exposure to the outside world. Any attempt by SCP-5408 to escape containment or gain unauthorized access to restricted areas must be met with the highest level of resistance. The potential damage to society is estimated to be catastrophic if SCP-5408's activities arenâ€™t monitored and supervised at all times.
