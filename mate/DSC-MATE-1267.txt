SCP-1267, also known as the "Traffic Tiger," is a male tiger who serves as a Traffic Officer in one of the bustling cities of our world. This anomalous creature is characterized by his vibrant VR Rainbow LED eyes, making it easier for him to see in the dark and illuminate the streets during his patrols. He is mostly seen wearing a Police Cap, a red scarf, and carrying a candy stick along with him.

SCP-1267 is known for his empathetic and compassionate nature, which is not typical of his species. He often goes out of his way to help others, and his willingness to lend a helping paw is unmatched. However, his altruistic behavior can sometimes become a burden, as he takes on other people's problems as his own, leading to exhaustion and burnout.

SCP-1267's presence in the city has proven invaluable in controlling traffic, apprehending criminals, and ensuring the safety of the populace. However, his anomalistic nature and kind disposition make him susceptible to exploitation by manipulating individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to keep a close eye on SCP-1267's motives to prevent any unauthorized activities.

Overall, SCP-1267's heart of gold and his unique ability to serve as a dedicated Traffic Officer make him a valuable asset to society. However, as with all SCPs with anomalous properties, utmost care must be taken to prevent misuse or harm to the public.
