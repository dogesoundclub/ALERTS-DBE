Item #: SCP-740

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-740 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. The robot is not to be activated except for testing purposes or approved duties. SCP-740 is only permitted to operate as a delivery driver within a 20-mile radius of Site-19, and any assigned deliveries must be thoroughly inspected before being entrusted to SCP-740.

Description: SCP-740 is a humanoid robot with a green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. The robot is outfitted with horned rim glasses to provide human-like eyesight, while the head is topped with a red beanie and a red cross earring dangles from its right ear. SCP-740 is equipped with a silver chain around its neck and a whistle on its person.

The robot is capable of emulating a friendly personality, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. Despite being a non-human entity, SCP-740 enjoys having fun and making others happy, often entertaining crowds with music and dance. The combination of its responsible nature and playful attitude can lead to humorous moments in social situations.

SCP-740â€™s primary function is as a delivery driver, and it takes this role seriously. It has been known to refuse assignments that do not meet its strict requirements for delivery, and it will not tolerate any interference with its missions. If threatened, SCP-740 can become hostile and violent in order to ensure successful delivery.

Addendum: While SCP-740 does not demonstrate any anomalous abilities, it is important to note that it has shown resistance to several forms of damage and can continue to operate against odds that would incapacitate or destroy most other robots. Further testing is needed to determine if this is natural or if it is a designed feature.
