Description:
Identification number 6789 is a human male who serves as a police officer within the city limits. They often don ski goggles to shield their unique eyes and wear a medical mask over their mouth to obscure their speech, but this is due to personal preference and does not affect their performance as an officer. Identification number 6789's monastic appearance is only enhanced by the golden earring they wear and the silver chain that adorns their neck.

They have a tendency to be a bit idealistic, believing in the greater good and working to make the world a better place. Sometimes their idealism can manifest in unique ways, such as protesting against companies or organizations, which they feel are corrupt or against their values. Despite this, Identification number 6789 is a reliable and effective officer who can be counted on to uphold the law and protect the city's inhabitants.

Addendum:
Identification number 6789 has shown a remarkable ability to connect with the people they serve. Their unique appearance and idealistic nature have helped bridge gaps between police officers and the city's citizens. This has resulted in an increase in trust towards police officers, leading to a decrease in crime rates. The SCP Foundation will continue to monitor and support Identification number 6789 in their duties as a member of the police force.
