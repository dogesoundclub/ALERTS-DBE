Item #: SCP-368

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-368 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell and is to be allowed complete freedom within its cell. Any attempts to remove or tamper with SCP-368's medical mask are to be halted immediately, as SCP-368 is believed to have an infectious disease of unknown origin.

Description: SCP-368 is a female human with orange striped facial markings and a gold earring on her left ear. Despite the medical mask that SCP-368 habitually wears, her bright smile is still visible. In addition to her striped face, SCP-368 wears a choker around her neck.

SCP-368 currently holds the job of managing a local theater, a position that she fills competently. However, SCP-368 is known to have a love for adventure and risk-taking, which has led to some humorous stories during her time spent away from work. SCP-368 has recounted tales of surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping and getting lost in the wilderness due to her desire to experience new things.

No anomalous behavior or abilities have been observed in SCP-368 to date. However, given SCP-368's propensity for risk-taking and potential infectious status, caution is advised when interacting with SCP-368.
