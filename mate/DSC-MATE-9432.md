Item #: 9432

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Agent 9432 is to be monitored at all times, both physically and electronically. She must wear her medical mask at all times when around others and may only remove it in the event of contamination. Any suspicious behavior or deviations from her normal routine must be reported immediately.

Description: Agent 9432 appears to be a human female, roughly in her mid-twenties. Her most notable feature is her red lipstick, which she wears without fail. Her eyes are also red and resemble those of a clown. Her head resembles that of an 00s school girl, but her overall appearance is non-descript.

Agent 9432 is a real estate agent by profession, but her true nature and purpose are unknown. She wears a black choker around her neck, which is believed to have some sort of significance.

Personality: Agent 9432 is highly introverted and lost in thought most of the time. It is said that she spends a lot of time daydreaming, which can lead to comical situations, such as walking into poles or tripping over objects. Her medical mask further isolates her from those around her, contributing to her already solitary nature.

Despite her introverted tendencies, Agent 9432 has a noticeable air of confidence and control, which is often unnerving to those around her. She rarely speaks, but when she does, her words are precise and deliberate.

It is speculated that Agent 9432 possesses some sort of paranormal ability, although the nature of said abilities is unknown. It is also unclear if her real estate profession is a cover for her true purposes or if itâ€™s a legitimate job.

Additional Notes: Agent 9432 is to be approached with caution as she may pose a potential threat. All attempts to establish communication with her have been met with little success. She is to be interrogated carefully in the event that she is detained.
