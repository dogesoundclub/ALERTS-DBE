SCP Foundation Report: 3379

Subject 3379, also known by her human name as [REDACTED], is a female reporter with distinctive physical features. She bears orange stripes on her cheeks, which may indicate a previous association with the anomalous. Her red clown eyes have been known to cause discomfort amongst onlookers, and her green cross earring is believed to hold significance to her.

Subject 3379 is easily distinguished by her bucket hat, which she is rarely seen without. Her choker is adorned with mysterious charms that suggest a familiarity with the occult. Though she appears to be human, it is advised to approach her with caution, as there may be more to her true nature than meets the eye.

In terms of personality, Subject 3379 demonstrates a strong emotional core. She is highly attuned to her feelings and prone to visceral reactions to art, music, and media. She may become overwhelmed or even weep during sentimental movie moments. This extreme sensitivity to stimuli makes her a key asset to the Foundation in certain investigative scenarios.

SCP agents are urged to keep their distance from Subject 3379, as there are indications that she may have ties to factors beyond the normal realm of human experience. Further study is needed to determine if she poses a threat to Foundation operations.
