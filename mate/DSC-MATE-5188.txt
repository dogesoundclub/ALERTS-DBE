Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5188 is to be contained in a humanoid containment cell at all times. No personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-5188 without prior approval from at least two Level 4 personnel. All interactions with SCP-5188 must be monitored and recorded for analysis.

Description: SCP-5188 is a male monkey of an unidentifiable species. SCP-5188's most notable facial feature is its frightened mouth, which is constantly agape. SCP-5188 wears normal glasses and has normal black hair. SCP-5188 also wears a goggle on its forehead and a jade earring in each ear. SCP-5188 often carries a candy stick, but it does not show any interest in consuming it.

SCP-5188 is a well-known politician that has gained popularity due to its dry sense of humor. It often catches people off guard with its deadpan jokes, which can be surprisingly funny. Despite its humorous demeanor, SCP-5188 often displays signs of extreme anxiety and fear.

SCP-5188's anomalous properties are yet to be fully understood, but it has been observed that SCP-5188 has the ability to influence the emotions of those around it. This ability appears to be subconscious, and SCP-5188 has no control over it. Those in the presence of SCP-5188 often report feeling anxious, nervous or fearful, but are unsure why.

Addendum: Following Incident-5188-A, SCP-5188's security clearance has been upgraded to Level 4. SCP-5188 is no longer allowed to attend public events or interact with civilians to prevent any further incidents. All communication with SCP-5188 now takes place through a soundproof glass barrier.
