Item #: 121

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with basic amenities. Access to personal and cellular devices is strictly prohibited. Guards are to interact with subject only when accompanied by at least one other staff member. Any attempts to communicate with or manipulate staff should be reported immediately.

Description: Subject is a humanoid female, identified as a lawyer with human ancestry. Notable features include purple lips, 90s-style brown hair, green cross earring on both ears, and a gold chain around the neck. Subject frequently wears a standard gas mask, which has been shown to offer no particular benefit to their health. They generally display an organized and calculating personality, which can result in controlling behavior that borders on obsessive. However, this trait can prove advantageous in group situations, allowing her to delegate tasks efficiently.

Due to her analytical personality, 121 has exhibited a strong affinity for puzzle-solving, strategic thinking, and deductive reasoning. These skills may prove useful in a variety of applications, from reconnaissance to infiltration.

Addendum: Despite strict containment measures, subject has demonstrated a propensity for manipulating and gathering information from DSC personnel. Special care and attention should be given to all communications and interactions with subject in the future.
