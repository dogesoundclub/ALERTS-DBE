Item #: DSC-MATE-4441

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4441 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage, located in a soundproofed room at Site-██. The cage must have a strength of at least 10,000 psi, be lined with multiple layers of sound dampening materials, and equipped with an electronic whistle-muting device. Under no circumstances should any personnel enter the containment chamber without proper sound-protection equipment. Feeding should only be done through a specially designed chute to minimize any physical contact with DSC-MATE-4441.

Description: DSC-MATE-4441 is a male mythological creature, resembling an anthropomorphic tiger. DSC-MATE-4441's most striking features are its blue clown eyes and a jade earring in its left ear. DSC-MATE-4441 is always seen wearing a blue bandana around its head, and it carries a silver whistle on a chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-4441 displays a frightened mouth, and its moods often change very quickly.

DSC-MATE-4441 tends to be very idealistic and exhibits a strong desire to make the world a better place. This often leads to humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or a cause that DSC-MATE-4441 feels goes against its values. However, DSC-MATE-4441's idealism can also manifest in more dangerous ways, such as violently attacking perceived oppressors or targets.

DSC-MATE-4441 is highly sensitive to sound and may become erratic and violent when exposed to loud noises. DSC-MATE-4441 exhibits an unusual resistance to both physical and electrical shock, and its strength and agility exceed that of any ordinary tiger. DSC-MATE-4441 also displays remarkable intelligence, often devising complex and unconventional escape routes.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4441 was discovered in the ███████ Zoo, where it had killed several handlers and escaped. Foundation operatives were able to capture DSC-MATE-4441 after several weeks of pursuit. During the capture, DSC-MATE-4441 injured several Foundation agents, and it was necessary to sedate it several times before containment could be achieved. DSC-MATE-4441 is currently considered highly dangerous, and any attempted escape must be dealt with immediately.
