SCP-6777, codenamed as "The Impulsive Electrician" is a human male electrician with a unique and eerie appearance. SCP-6777 sports a golden earring on its left ear, which has an unknown meaning and purpose. However, the most striking feature of SCP-6777 is the circular-shaped spot located around the mouth area of the face, which radiates a neon green hue. It is said that SCP-6777's mouth spot flashes violently, like a defective neon sign, when SCP-6777 experiences emotional turmoil.

SCP-6777's eyes are of the VR Jade LED type - a technological implant that allows SCP-6777 to see beyond the limitations of human eyesight. The purpose of this implant is currently unknown, but its ability to display augmented reality could provide SCP-6777 with an edge in its line of work.

In addition to these strange features, SCP-6777 is known for donning a bright red scarf and sometimes carrying a candy stick. SCP-6777's use of these items is unknown, but they seem to provide SCP-6777 with some emotional support and comfort.

SCP-6777 can be a bit of a wildcard - the subject can act on his emotions without thinking things through, which often leads to humorous, yet unpredictable situations. This unpredictable and impulsive behavior could pose a potential danger to SCP-6777 and others around him. Hence, the Foundation has strict protocols to contain and monitor SCP-6777's activities.

Overall, SCP-6777's unique appearance, augmented vision and unpredictable behavior make it an intriguing and potentially dangerous subject for research. The research team is currently investigating the possible connections between SCP-6777's appearance, behavior, and abilities.
