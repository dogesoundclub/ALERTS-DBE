Item #: SCP-9930

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9930 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-19. All interactions with SCP-9930 should be monitored via closed-circuit television and conducted by Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-9930 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth, VR rainbow LED eyes, and a hoodie on its head. SCP-9930 also possesses one accessory, a cigarette. SCP-9930 appears to have a unique ability to use the virtual reality software to manipulate the world around it.

SCP-9930's personality is impulsive, and it is often seen taking risks on a whim. This can lead to humorous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river. Despite these risks, SCP-9930 maintains a level of intelligence and awareness of its actions, showing a notable level of understanding of the world and the SCP Foundation's containment procedures.

SCP-9930 came into the foundation's custody after reports came in of a monkey acting in bizarre behaviors and manipulating reality around it. The Foundation sent out agents to retrieve SCP-9930 and contained it in Site-19 for further research.

Addendum: SCP-9930 has taken a liking to one of the Foundation's reporters and has been observed having conversations with them. It is currently being debated whether or not to allow SCP-9930 to continue these interactions.
