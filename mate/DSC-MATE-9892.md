Item #: DSC-MATE-9892

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9892 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All personnel are strictly prohibited from making any physical contact with DSC-MATE-9892 for their own safety.

DSC-MATE-9892's chamber must be consistently monitored through CCTV cameras to ensure its containment. Any escape attempts must be immediately reported to Site Command.

Description: DSC-MATE-9892 is a male monkey salesman with a frightened mouth and jade earring adorning both of its ears. It has green hair under a purple cap and wears a red scarf and an LED gas mask as accessories.

DSC-MATE-9892 exhibits empathetic and compassionate behavior towards others, but also has a tendency to take on other people's problems as their own, which can be both admirable and exhausting. This behavior is believed to be caused by DSC-MATE-9892's innate desire to help others, at the cost of its own well-being.

DSC-MATE-9892's exact species and eye color are currently unknown due to its reluctance to remove its gas mask.

DSC-MATE-9892 was initially contained by the Foundation after it was found attempting to aid wounded individuals in a car accident. During containment, DSC-MATE-9892 expressed a desire to continue working as a car salesman in the human world, but was denied due to its anomalous properties.

Addendum: Despite being contained, DSC-MATE-9892 continues to express a strong desire to help others. Careful monitoring of its mental state is necessary to ensure it does not take on the problems of Foundation personnel or attempt to aid in any potentially hazardous situations.
