Item #: 2081

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2081 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment room at Site-██. Access to SCP-2081 is restricted to Level 2 clearance and above. SCP-2081 is required to undergo a standard physical examination every six months. Any requests by SCP-2081 for additional accessories must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2081 appears to be a male anthropomorphic tiger with ski goggle eyes and a police cap on their head. They also have jade earrings in their ears, which they claim to reflect their heritage. SCP-2081 wears a silver chain and is often seen smoking a cigarette. 

SCP-2081's personality is unique in that they have an extremely strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when it is needed. This behavior extends beyond physical activities and may result in SCP-2081 refusing mental or emotional support, leading to instances of mild to severe stress. SCP-2081 resulted in several humorous situations for the containment team, such as attempting to lift heavy equipment or "refusing" to use a GPS system while lost.

Despite their independent nature, SCP-2081 is remarkably level-headed, intelligent, and a capable lawyer who has won several high-profile cases that appear to be influenced by their particular skill set. SCP-2081 shows no signs of aggressive behavior or hostility towards anything or anyone.

Addendum: In their free time, SCP-2081 is often seen reading law books and working on cases they believe in. They have shown particular interest in environmental law, arguing for animal rights and conservation efforts. SCP-2081's behavior regarding the aforementioned subject is noted to change, becoming more emotive and passionate about the issue. Further research is advised on this subject.
