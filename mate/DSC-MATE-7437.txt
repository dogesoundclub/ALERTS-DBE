SCP-7437 is a male rabbit of unknown origins, believed to have been born in a magical realm. With vibrant red clown eyes and a head adorned with a purple cap and headset, 7437 is hard to miss. On their forehead, 7437 wears a pair of goggles, possibly to enhance vision or to use as a fashion statement. Additionally, they sport a red scarf and carry a candy stick in their mouth.

As a beautician, 7437 uses their natural charm and talent to make their clients feel confident and beautiful. They approach their work with a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but when it comes to their loved ones, they are fiercely loyal and protective. This aspect of their personality has led to many humorous situations, as they have gotten into heated arguments with anyone who insults or threatens their friends and family members.

Despite their friendly and trusting nature, 7437's origins remain unknown, and their unusual appearance could possibly suggest anomalous properties. Therefore, all interaction with SCP-7437 must be strictly monitored and controlled.
