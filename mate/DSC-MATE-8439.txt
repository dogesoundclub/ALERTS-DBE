SCP Identification number 8439 belongs to a particularly unique creature of the species monkey, with a distinctive penchant for style and grooming. This male individual sports a head full of vibrant green hair that contrasts starkly with his purple cap, which always sits upon his head at a jaunty angle. However, the most striking feature on his forehead is the pair of goggles that are permanently affixed there, serving as both an article of fashion and utility. 

You will not mistake 8439 for any other monkey, though their accessory of choice might give you pause - this particularly fashionable creature is always draped in a normal gas mask, undoubtedly a testament to their passion for their vocation as a beautician. They take their work seriously, and there is no look, no style, that they cannot achieve with impressive ease. But be forewarned: their ambition knows no bounds, and although they take on more than their fair share, they never falter. 

This determined and clever individual is driven by their goal-oriented nature, and their strategic thinking skills are practically unmatched. They excel at organization, always keenly aware of the moving parts necessary to accomplish any task. Though their single-mindedness can occasionally lead them to overreach, they always manage to pull off what they set their mind to, time and time again. 

SCP 8439 is truly one of a kind, both in their appearance and remarkable abilities. Both captivating and efficient, they are a force to be reckoned with - especially when it comes to making you look your absolute best.
