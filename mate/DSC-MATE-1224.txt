Item #: 1224

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 1224 is to be monitored by the local police department, not Foundation personnel. Any attempts to intervene in their daily duties must be authorized by a Level 3 personnel or higher. Officer 1224 is to wear their LED gas mask at all times when on duty to ensure their abilities do not manifest in public.

Description: Officer 1224 is a human male with a distinctive jade earring and a red scarf. Their most notable feature is their infectious smile, which they seem to wear even in the gravest of situations. Despite their profession as a police officer, Officer 1224 exhibits behavior that is more akin to a counselor or therapist. They have an innate ability to empathize with others and often take on their problems as their own.

Officer 1224's personality can be both admirable and exhausting, as they feel a strong sense of responsibility to fix everything and everyone around them. This overwhelming sense of compassion is what sets them apart from others in their profession. However, this tendency to take on other people's problems can often lead to emotional exhaustion, which they are unable to address due to their inability to turn away from those in need.

It is suspected that Officer 1224 possesses some form of anomalous ability, though the extent of their powers is unknown. It is believed that their abilities may manifest in times of stress or crisis, though this has yet to be confirmed.

Addendum: Officer 1224 has been deemed a valuable asset in dealing with supernatural cases within the local police department. It is recommended that they be monitored for any signs of emotional distress, as their empathic abilities may make them more susceptible to mental health issues.
