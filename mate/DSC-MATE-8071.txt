Item #: SCP-8071

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8071 is to be kept in a standard primate enclosure within Site-19. The enclosure should be outfitted with a variety of puzzles and games to keep SCP-8071 mentally stimulated. A daily supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, along with occasional live insects, should be provided as sustenance. SCP-8071 is not to be exposed to any electronic devices or machinery, as its natural curiosity may lead to inadvertently damaging or manipulating such technology.

Description: SCP-8071 is a male monkey of undetermined species, standing approximately 0.8 meters in height and weighing 12 kilograms. Its most striking features are its bright red clown eyes and parted pink head. On its forehead, SCP-8071 wears a pair of goggles and a two-color band. It also wears a gold earring, gold chain, and carries a whistle as accessories.

SCP-8071 exhibits a deep curiosity about the world around it and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. It has been observed randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, often to their confusion or amusement. Despite its inquisitive nature, SCP-8071 can be easily frightened and will cower or scream when faced with certain stimuli.

SCP-8071 has exhibited an aptitude for mechanical work and enjoys tinkering with various devices. However, its lack of understanding of modern machinery often results in accidental damage or malfunction. As such, it has been assigned the role of mechanic within Site-19, where it is limited to working on less complex mechanical devices such as bicycles or simple engines.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8071 attempted to repair a broken computer terminal in the site's main control room. Upon activation, the terminal displayed multiple anomalous properties, including a sudden loss of power and a series of ghostly images appearing on the screen. SCP-8071 was severely frightened by the event and is no longer allowed to handle or interact with any electronic devices.
