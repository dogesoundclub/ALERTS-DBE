Item #: SCP-3022

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3022 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced walls and ceiling to endure its strength, and must be fed with an appropriate amount of meat daily. The area around it is monitored by three security personnel equipped with tranquilizing guns and is restricted to authorized personnel only. Interaction with SCP-3022 should be conducted via remote interactions, with its visitors situated in soundproof booths. All recovered communication devices from SCP-3022 must be examined to ensure there is no information breach.

Description: SCP-3022 is a male humanoid of the species Panthera tigris, standing 1.9 meters in height and weighing approximately 410 kg. It has a human-like face with a frightened mouth and green hair in a purple cap. There is a two-color band on the forehead and jade earring on the ears. SCP-3022 often displays anxiety, manifesting by nail-biting, tapping its feet, and pacing. It carries two accessories identified as a red scarf and a cigarette.

SCP-3022 works as a car salesman at a dealership in [REDACTED]. Its ability to generate sales increased 38% compared to non-anomalous salesmen. Customers report feeling compelled to buy. The possibility of memetic influence is being investigated. When SCP-3022 interacts with personnel, it shows keen observation skills, making it an excellent gift giver. However, it has an obsessive personality that causes it to struggle with giving the perfect gift to the point of aggression.

Addendum: During a routine assessment of SCP-3022's mobile phone, a message was discovered indicating it had contact with several unidentified individuals. The discovery suggests that SCP-3022 may have been involved in criminal activity or association with persons of interdimensional origin. Investigations are ongoing.
