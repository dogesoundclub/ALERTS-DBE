Item #: SCP-6743

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6743 is to be tracked at all times by undercover Foundation operatives posing as city traffic personnel. Personnel are to maintain a distance of at least 10 meters and are not to engage SCP-6743 in any way unless absolutely necessary. It is not currently believed that SCP-6743 possesses any anomalous abilities other than its unique appearance and personality.

Description: SCP-6743 is a human male identified as a traffic officer named [REDACTED]. SCP-6743 is immediately recognizable due to its distinctive orange stripes, 2 color band on its forehead, and jade earring. Its glasses are ordinary, with no apparent modifications of any kind. SCP-6743 is generally ambulatory and appears to be healthy.

SCP-6743 displays personality traits that are often associated with high-achievers, such as an ambitious and goal-oriented attitude, strategic thinking, and excellent organizational skills. However, SCP-6743 often takes on more than it can handle, which can put it into extremely dangerous situations. SCP-6743 is also known to be incredibly frightened by unknown entities, indicated by its "frightened mouth" feature.

Accessories have been observed when SCP-6743 goes on patrol, including a medical mask and a red scarf. It is unknown if these accessories provide any additional anomalous effects.

Addendum: SCP-6743 has displayed awareness of the Foundation's surveillance of its activities, which suggests that it may have anomalous abilities beyond its appearance and personality. Further research is ongoing.
