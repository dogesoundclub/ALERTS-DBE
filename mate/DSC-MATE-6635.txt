Item #: 6635

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6635 is to be monitored under constant surveillance to ensure the safety of the public. Any anomalous activities are to be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation personnel. SCP-6635 is currently employed as a fast food worker at a popular chain restaurant and is required to wear a uniform that covers her apparent rabbit head and jade earrings at all times while on duty. Any attempts to remove or modify SCP-6635's appearance are strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-6635 appears to be a normal human female with distinct facial features, including numerous spots on her face and purple lips. However, upon further observation, SCP-6635's head takes on the appearance of a pink rabbit, with jade earrings situated on her long, pointed ears. SCP-6635 also wears a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-6635's personality is characterized by their highly organized and efficient nature. They tend to take charge of group projects and events and delegate tasks in a very matter-of-fact way, often coming across as controlling. Despite this, SCP-6635 is generally well-liked among their coworkers and often finds humor in their organizational tactics.

SCP-6635's anomalous properties are currently under investigation, but as of yet, no clear explanation has been identified. Further research into SCP-6635's abilities and potential dangers is ongoing.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-6635 was witnessed by several customers at the fast food restaurant performing an unknown ritual involving several items found in the restaurant's storage room. Foundation personnel were immediately dispatched to the scene and SCP-6635 was taken into custody. Further investigation revealed no harmful effects from the ritual, but SCP-6635 has since been moved to a more secure containment facility.
