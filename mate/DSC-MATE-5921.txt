Item #: 5921

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5921 is to be monitored at all times by undercover agents posing as political personnel. All public appearances and statements are to be approved and monitored by the Foundation to ensure no breaches of SCP-related information occur. Any potential danger or suspicious behavior must be reported immediately to Site Director.

Description: SCP-5921 is a human female of unknown age and origin, assumed to be of Terran origin. The subject presents several unusual physical traits, including orange stripes on her cheekbones, blue clown eyes, and red lips. SCP-5921's head is covered by an ushanka hat, concealing her hair color and texture. The subject tends to wear distinctive jade earrings and a silver chain around her neck.

SCP-5921's personality is erratic, and they spend an excessive amount of time daydreaming or lost in profound thought. The subject has a tendency to suddenly stop in the middle of conversations or public speeches, sometimes for minutes at a time, leading those around them to question their sanity. Despite this, SCP-5921 possess an abnormal level of charisma and persuasiveness, able to convince crowds of people to support her causes and beliefs.

SCP-5921 is a politician, currently working in local government, which allows them access to classified information that could potentially compromise the Foundation's efforts. As a result, covert Foundation agents are to attend all briefings held by SCP-5921 to ensure that no breach of information occurs.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, reports suggested that SCP-5921 was aware of the Foundation's existence and was attempting to use their political connections to force the Foundation to work for them. Investigation revealed that SCP-5921's abilities were indeed anomalous, and a decision was made to reclassify it as Euclid. The subject has since been closely monitored to ensure her compliance with Foundation directives.
