Item #: 5664

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Object 5664 is to be kept in a well-lit room with access to a small garden space. The garden must contain a variety of plants compatible with a herbivorous diet. 5664 is permitted free range in its contained area, but must return to its designated kennel nightly.

Description: 

5664 appears to be a common rabbit with blue clown eyes, a retro cap, and jade earring. It wears a red scarf and carries a candy stick at all times. Characteristically, it has shown a laid-back and easy-going personality that only becomes ferociously protective of loved ones. It is unclear how 5664 became sentient.

Initial reports of 5664 began in [REDACTED], a small town near the [REDACTED] forest preserve. Local mechanics had reported missing tools and parts from their garages, only to discover 5664 eagerly fixing vehicles behind them. Since then, 5664 has been allowed to continue its work as a mechanic in exchange for its own food, kennel, and materials to work with.

5664 is known to become animated during arguments involving insinuations against friends and family. It is recommended that all personnel avoid provoking 5664 to maintain a calm environment. 

Addendum:

5664 has displayed a degree of hostility with regards to other animals on several occasions, but maintains neutrality with humans. As long as regulations are respected, 5664 poses no threat to others or itself. Further research into the rabbit's intelligence and anomalous abilities is ongoing.
