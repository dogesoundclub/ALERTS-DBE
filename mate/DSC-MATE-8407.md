Item #: DSC-MATE-8407

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8407 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-█. She is to be provided with adequate farming equipment and supplies for sustenance. Access to any electronic devices, particularly those with Internet connectivity, must be restricted.

Description: DSC-MATE-8407, also known as "The Farmer", is a humanoid female of average height and build. Her most notable feature is the VR Rainbow LED eyes, which emit a colorful glow at all times. Her head is asymmetrical, with one side being orange in color. There is a goggle attached to her forehead that she wears occasionally. The ears are adorned with jade earrings, and she wears a choker around her neck.

DSC-MATE-8407's personality is very organized and efficient, as evidenced by her job as a farmer. She tends to be in control of situations, including group projects and events, sometimes appearing controlling to others. She has a matter-of-fact way of delegating tasks that can lead to humorous situations.

DSC-MATE-8407 has demonstrated anomalous abilities that allow her to manipulate and control plant growth within a limited radius. She is capable of accelerating plant growth, producing larger yield with higher quality crops. Plants that have been affected by DSC-MATE-8407's abilities exhibit a peculiar rainbow-colored hue.

DSC-MATE-8407's abilities seem to be linked to her use of electronic devices, particularly those with Internet connectivity. When exposed to them, her abilities become heightened and uncontrollable. It is theorized that she is linked to a digital entity that grants her abilities.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8407 displayed an unprecedented use of her abilities, causing all plant life within a 50-meter radius to grow at an accelerated rate. This resulted in a containment breach and caused significant damage to the facility. DSC-MATE-8407 was apprehended and relocated to its current containment site. All electronic devices and Internet connectivity have been removed from her access.
