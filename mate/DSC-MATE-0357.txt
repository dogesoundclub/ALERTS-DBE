The containment unit must be sealed at all times except for authorized personnel, who must always be in a full hazmat suit.

Description: Item 357 is a male monkey with a unique appearance. Its eyes are replaced with VR rainbow LED lights that project a range of colors based on its mood. Item 357's mouth is almost always frightened with its tongue sticking out, and it is always seen wearing a red beanie on its head. It is usually adorned with a gold chain, although the purpose is unknown.

Item 357 is a lover of adventure and is always eager to try new things. This reckless behavior sometimes leads to humorous stories, including evading death while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in unfamiliar terrain. Caution must be exercised when executing experiments on this object, as it possesses a wild temperament that can turn hostile if it feels threatened.

In order to utilize this expertise, authorized personnel may seek advice on treatments and cures for GOC-inflicted injuries, although any physical interaction between staff and Item 357 should be kept to a minimum.
