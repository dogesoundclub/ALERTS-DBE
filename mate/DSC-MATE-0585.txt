Item #: SCP-585

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-585 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access is restricted to Level 2 personnel only, and any interaction with SCP-585 must be supervised by at least one security personnel. SCP-585 is to be provided with a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as a variety of toys and puzzles to keep them stimulated.

Description: SCP-585 appears to be a male monkey with blue clown-like eyes and a single jade earring in their right ear. They wear a silver chain around their neck and carry a candy stick at all times. SCP-585 has displayed above-average intelligence and is highly observant and attentive to details. They have an excellent memory and can recall even the smallest details of events or conversations.

SCP-585 has a strong desire to please others and is an excellent gift-giver. However, they can also become overly concerned with finding the "perfect" gift and may spend significant amounts of time and energy trying to find the ideal present. SCP-585 appears to have a friendly and playful personality, but can also become easily agitated if they feel threatened or mistreated.

Addendum: SCP-585 was initially discovered working as a security guard at a local mall. Foundation agents observed SCP-585 using their skills to prevent theft and shoplifting, and were able to successfully contain them without incident. SCP-585 has since adapted well to containment and appears to be content with their new environment.
