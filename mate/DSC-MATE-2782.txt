SCP-2782, also known as "The Metalhead", is a peculiar human real estate agent that possesses a highly detail-oriented personality. Upon initial observation, SCP-2782 appears unremarkable, adorned with a pair of nerd glasses and a golden chain. However, closer examination reveals that the entirety of SCP-2782's cranium is made of a seemingly unknown metallic substance that has been colored purple. Furthermore, SCP-2782 sports an extravagant jade earring on his right ear.

SCP-2782's peculiar alterness manifests in a myriad of unexpected ways, detailing remarkable attention to organization in every aspect of his life. SCP-2782 is known to meticulously alphabetize everything, from his spice rack to his closet, making sure every single detail is in order. Such behavior seems to feed into SCP-2782's fascination with metal music, often using his real estate agent persona to help find appropriate venues for local bands around the city.

Despite SCP-2782's harmless appearance and day-job, multiple anomalous events have been reported to coincide with his movements. Notably, objects and locations around SCP-2782 have been known to exhibit unusual metallic properties such as rusting faster or taking on a sheen that wasn't present before. It remains unknown whether SCP-2782 is aware of his potential anomalies or if he is even the source of these strange occurrences.

SCP-2782 currently resides within Site-17, where he is held in a standard humanoid containment cell. He has been deemed safe for study, though researchers are encouraged to be cautious around any metallic objects when interacting with SCP-2782.
