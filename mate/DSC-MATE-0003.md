Item #: DSC-XXXX-3

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-XXXX-3 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-19. The subject is allowed to wear his firefighting uniform at all times, but must wear a medical mask and red scarf when outside of his chamber. Any interactions with the subject must be monitored by a Level 2 personnel at all times.

Description: DSC-XXXX-3 is a male human of average build and height, with distinct spotted facial features and a frightened mouth. The subject wears normal glasses and a short peak cap on his head, as well as a red scarf as an accessory. DSC-XXXX-3 works as a firefighter but exhibits no anomalous abilities or tendencies.

Despite having no evident connection to the supernatural, DSC-XXXX-3 has been deemed worthy of containment due to his infectious enthusiasm and ability to stir excitement in others. The subject tends to be very energetic and optimistic, often becoming overly excited about mundane events or situations that others may find dull. This behavior has caused some humorous situations, but also poses a potential risk to the secrecy and safety of the Foundation's operations.

DSC-XXXX-3's medical mask is to be worn at all times when interacting with Foundation personnel in order to protect against potential minor anomalous effects that may manifest through the subject's enthusiasm. To date, no such anomaly has been observed, but caution is still recommended. DSC-XXXX-3 has shown no resistance to containment procedures and appears to be content with his living arrangements.

Addendum: Due to the low risk posed by DSC-XXXX-3, consideration has been given to downgrading his Object Class to Euclid. This discussion is ongoing and will be further evaluated by Level 2 personnel.
