Personality: 

Subject 176's personality is characterized by her empathetic nature and concern for others. Her emotional reactions to the suffering of others can make her a liability in certain situations, but her compassion can also make her an asset in certain situations involving negotiations or interrogations.

Any interaction with the subject must be approached with caution and consideration of her emotional state. Any harm or distress caused to animals may cause her emotional distress and is strictly forbidden. 

Note: Subject 176's abilities must be studied further for potential use in the Foundation's ongoing research for developing a more compassionate and empathetic agent.
