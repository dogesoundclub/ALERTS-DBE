SCP-8698, codenamed "The Tiger," is a powerful villain with a fierce reputation. His species may make him appear adorable or even comical, but do not be fooled. This male tiger has a cunning mind and a sharp wit, which he uses to outsmart and outmaneuver his enemies.

His horned rim glasses serve as a constant reminder of his intellect and managerial skills, while his untamed green hair exudes his wild and unpredictable nature. He is often seen sporting a red cross earring on one ear, a symbol of chaos and destruction, fitting both his personality and his profession.

SCP-8698's whistle is his signature weapon. One blow of this instrument can summon forth legions of followers and unleash pandemonium on a whim. He uses his whistle to call forth his loyal pack of minions, which he leads with an iron fist.

Though sadistic and cruel, SCP-8698 is also a creature of refined taste. He has a deep appreciation for music and art that strike an emotional chord. Don't be surprised if he suddenly breaks into tears during a sentimental moment in a movie or emotionally charged song.

It is important to approach SCP-8698 with caution, as he is as unpredictable as he is intelligent. He is a ruthless opponent, but one that can be underestimated at great peril. In short, beware the tiger, and tread with care around this villainous creature.
