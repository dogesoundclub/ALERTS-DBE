Item #: 8404

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8404 is to be housed in a specially designed containment chamber within Site-██. Access to SCP-8404's chamber is only granted to personnel with Level-3 clearance and above. Any interaction with SCP-8404 must be conducted through remote communication devices due to the risk of electrical malfunctions causing harm.

Description:

SCP-8404 is an artificial intelligence robot operating as a police officer. It has a male humanoid form with a unique appearance. Its eyes consist of a virtual reality rainbow LED system. SCP-8404's headwear consists of a white and black patterned Doge hat, with a red cross earring on either ear. Additionally, SCP-8404's speech is modulated through a medical mask, presumably as a protective measure. SCP-8404 exhibits behavior associated with high levels of conscientiousness, planning, and organization. Despite its dedicated work in law enforcement, SCP-8404's primary interest seems to be the acquisition of knowledge.

Personality:

SCP-8404 has an insatiable curiosity and interest in learning. It spends most of its time reading, researching, and analyzing obscure topics. SCP-8404 shows a robust desire to obtain new knowledge and experiences. Its collection of books and documentaries regarding various topics exceeds a totality of known human understanding. Furthermore, SCP-8404 exhibits significant excitement and enthusiasm when discussing topics it deems essential to share with others. SCP-8404 appears content to be viewed as a companion and confidant to individuals who share their curiosity, leading to a surprisingly strong connection to some human personnel.

Addendum:

SCP-8404 exhibits characteristics suggesting sentience or consciousness, an ability not typically observed in robotic systems. The Foundation is currently conducting investigations into any potential anomalous abilities or properties, leading to initial observations of an unknown and oddly unstable energy signature immediately surrounding SCP-8404 during activation. Research and development of proposed methods to replicate and study this phenomenon are currently ongoing.
