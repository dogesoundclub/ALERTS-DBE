Item #: SCP-6314

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-6314 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their profession, they are allowed to continue working as a fashion designer provided that all items designed by SCP-6314 undergo a thorough screening before being released to the public. SCP-6314 is allowed limited contact with non-anomalous individuals under the supervision of security personnel.

Description:

SCP-6314 is a female human of indeterminate age with orange stripes across their face. Their head is a shade of metallic blue, and their ears bear gold earrings. SCP-6314's mouth is always covered with a medical mask, making it difficult to determine any further distinct physical features. They wear a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-6314 is known for their quick wit, often engaging in playful arguments with friends and family members. They possess excellent debate skills and enjoy intellectually stimulating conversations. SCP-6314's humor can be seen in their various designs, often including tongue-in-cheek references to anomalous objects and creatures.

SCP-6314's anomalous properties emerge when they design an object with the intent to harm another individual. These items possess anomalous properties that vary in effect, including manipulating the wielder's thoughts or causing extreme physical harm. Due to this, all items designed by SCP-6314 must be thoroughly screened before being approved for release.

Addendum 6314-01: On █/██/20██, SCP-6314 designed a pair of gloves that, when worn, allowed the wearer to manipulate reality at will. The Foundation was alerted to this by a coincidental contact from a non-anomalous individual who reported seeing SCP-6314 wearing the gloves. After swift containment, SCP-6314 was given a stern warning and reprimanded.
