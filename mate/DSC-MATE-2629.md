Item #: 2629

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2629 is to be strictly monitored while on duty as a security guard at all times. Any anomalous behavior must be reported to the authorities immediately. Personnel are to avoid interacting with the subject, as their spontaneous behavior may pose a risk.

Description: Subject 2629 is a female of the Homo sapiens species, displaying unique physical traits. The subject has numerous spots on their face, believed to be a genetic anomaly. They wear a tiara on their head and have green cross earrings on their ears. Subject 2629 wears normal glasses that appear to have no anomalous properties. Their most distinct feature is their red lips, which often stand out in contrast with their otherwise-muted appearance. They carry a silver chain and are frequently observed holding a cigarette.

Subject 2629 displays a distinct personality, which has proven difficult to manage. They exhibit a strong tendency to plan ahead, but also possess a spontaneous side, which can lead to anomalies. This causes them to behave abruptly, often leading to situations that are difficult to control. Their impromptu adventures and party planning have drawn attention from law enforcement and other organizations. The Foundation has classified the subject as a potential security risk, given their unpredictable behavior.

Addendum 2629-1: Following a security breach, the Foundation has determined that subject 2629 possessed anomalous abilities, which they had concealed. Further investigation revealed that the subject had been aware of their abilities for years, but had chosen not to disclose them. Anomalies observed in relation to subject 2629 are classified as tau-level anomalies.

Addendum 2629-2: Effective immediately, subject 2629 is to be contained in a specialized Foundation facility for further study. Personnel are directed to exercise caution and not to interact with the subject without approval from the O5 council.
