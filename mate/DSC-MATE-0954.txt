SCP-954 is a human electrician with distinctive orange stripes on their face. Their metal blue head is complemented by a pair of normal glasses that frame their eyes. SCP-954 has a green cross earring in one of their ears, and they often accessorize with a gold chain and cigarette.

SCP-954's personality is marked by their strong idealism and desire to improve the world around them. Despite their often humorous protests and boycotts against causes that they deem to be morally bankrupt, SCP-954 possesses a deep empathy for all living beings. Their unwavering commitment to their beliefs makes them a valuable asset to the Foundation, as they are willing to go to great lengths in order to achieve their goals. However, SCP-954's idealism can also make them vulnerable to manipulation by outside forces. Therefore, it is crucial that they be monitored closely and kept well-informed about any potential threats to their beliefs.
