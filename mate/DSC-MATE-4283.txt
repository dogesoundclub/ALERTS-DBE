Addendum: Interview with SCP-4283

The following transcript is taken from an interview conducted on ██/██/██ with SCP-4283.

Dr. ██████: Good morning, SCP-4283. How are you feeling today?

SCP-4283: [SCP-4283 remains silent for a few seconds before tilting his head and staring at Dr. ██████.] I'm feeling absolutely fantastic, thank you for asking. What can I do for you today?

Dr. ██████: I was hoping to learn more about your motivations and reasons for behaving in a villainous manner.

SCP-4283: [SCP-4283 chuckles and shakes his head.] Oh, Doctor, you do love to ask the easy questions, don't you? Let me ask you this: why do you lock up birds in cages for your personal enjoyment?

Dr. ██████: That's a false analogy, SCP-4283. As an intelligent being, you have the capacity to make choices and decisions. Why choose to act in a way that is detrimental to others?

SCP-4283: [SCP-4283 leans back and sighs.] Let me rephrase that: I act in a way that is true to myself, regardless of other people's opinions or expectations. The same cannot be said for most people, can it?

Dr. ██████: I see. And what do you hope to achieve by acting in a villainous manner?

SCP-4283: [SCP-4283 grins.] Why, I do it for the fun of it, Doctor. There's nothing more exhilarating than causing a little chaos, don't you agree?
