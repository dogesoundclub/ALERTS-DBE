Item #: 3058

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3058 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The choker and gas mask are to be kept on at all times unless authorized by Level 4 personnel or higher. Any attempts to remove or tamper with these items must be met with immediate disciplinary action. DSC-MATE-3058 is permitted to perform its designated role as a traffic officer within a designated jurisdiction, but must be accompanied by a security detail at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-3058 appears to be a female human with distinctive spots on her face, and red clown eyes. Its hair is short and of a witch-like style, and it has a pair of jade earrings. DSC-MATE-3058 wears a choker around its neck and a normal gas mask at all times.

DSC-MATE-3058 exhibits a strong sense of independence and is resistant to authority or rules that it views as unnecessary. It frequently engages in rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of work early or taking days off without permission. It is believed that this personality trait is linked to its anomalous abilities, which allow it to manipulate and control the behavior of those around it.

DSC-MATE-3058's gas mask provides protection from its anomalous abilities, which can affect those in close proximity to it. When the gas mask is deactivated or removed, those affected experience a heightened susceptibility to DSC-MATE-3058's influence. It is unknown if the choker serves a protective purpose or has any anomalous properties.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3058 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of erratic behavior from the local police department. Initial contact was made with DSC-MATE-3058 during a routine traffic stop, during which time it became apparent that it possessed anomalous abilities. After covert containment was established, it was determined that DSC-MATE-3058's abilities are linked to emotional and mental states, and can be triggered by certain conditions or stimuli.

Further research is ongoing to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-3058's abilities and how to mitigate their effects.
