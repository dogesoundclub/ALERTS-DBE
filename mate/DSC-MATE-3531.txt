Description: SCP-3531 is a humanoid robot designed to operate as a train driver. Its head is adorned with a retro cap complete with a jade earring and horn-rimmed glasses. SCP-3531 is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-3531's programming shows a unique personality, characterized by its ambitious and goal-oriented nature. SCP-3531's drive to achieve can sometimes lead it to take on more than it can handle, but through strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills, it usually manages to succeed.

SCP-3531 is not thought to be self-aware but shows signs of mild autonomous behavior. In testing, SCP-3531 has repeatedly expressed satisfaction with its job and an eagerness to learn more.

SCP-3531 was initially discovered when passengers reported a train driver who never left the cab, leading to suspicions of foul play. Foundation agents detained the train and found SCP-3531 at the controls. It is currently unknown who created SCP-3531 or for what purpose.

Addendum: In a rare show of emotion, SCP-3531 requested to be called by the name "Frank." While SCP-3531's designation will remain as such, foundation personnel are asked to refer to SCP-3531 as "Frank" during interactions.
