Item #: 7118

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7118 is to be monitored via surveillance cameras installed throughout his place of work. Any abnormalities or changes in behavior must be reported immediately to the research team. Subject 7118 is to be approached with caution, as he has shown signs of unpredictability in the past. Physical contact with the subject is strictly prohibited.

Description: Subject 7118 is a male tiger of unknown origin, currently employed as a car salesman in a local dealership. His frightened mouth and medical mask tend to cause unease among customers and coworkers alike. Additionally, his jade LED eyes and jade earring make for a striking contrast against his not arranged green head. Subject 7118 is rarely seen without his silver chain, which he claims brings him good luck.

Subject 7118 possesses a love for adventure and taking risks, a temperament not normally associated with typical tigers. His previous experiences include surviving a near-death bungee-jumping experience and accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. These anecdotal stories may seem humorous, but pose danger to those around him.

Addendum: Subject 7118 has recently displayed erratic behavior, including increased aggression towards coworkers and customers. It is currently unknown if this behavior is linked to his non-typical tiger personality or if there is a more sinister cause. Further observation is necessary.
