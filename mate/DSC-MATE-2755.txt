Item #: SCP-2755

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2755 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-2755 is only allowed for personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any interaction with SCP-2755 must be recorded and monitored by security personnel. Any changes in behavior or mood must be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-2755 is a male Siberian tiger with an unusual interest in creative arts. It appears to be highly intelligent and loves to play both mentally and physically stimulating games. SCP-2755 is often seen wearing a red beanie hat and a red cross earring in its left ear. In addition, SCP-2755 wears an LED-gas mask as an accessory in order to express its individuality.

SCP-2755 has a vivacious imagination and often spends its free time penning down poetry and creating intricate cosplay costumes. It has a love for collecting unusual objects and can be easily distracted by artistic expressions. SCP-2755's behavior, however, can shift significantly in mood and temperament, possibly due to its species' instinctive traits.

SCP-2755 appears to be highly enthusiastic when caring for animals, and it often finds comfort and solace in their presence. SCP-2755 is deeply passionate about the veterinary field and will go to great lengths to save animal lives. However, it has demonstrated an inappropriate level of aggression towards humans who have intentionally harmed animals in its presence.

Addendum: SCP-2755 has shown substantial improvement over the years since its containment began. It has become more docile and cooperative, although its unpredictable nature still remains a source of concern for Foundation personnel. SCP-2755 has expressed an interest in helping with the care of other anomalous creatures and has requested a transfer to Site-17's anomalous animal welfare department. This proposal is still under review and pending approval by the Site Director.
