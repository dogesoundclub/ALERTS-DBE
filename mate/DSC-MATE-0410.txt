Item #: SCP-410

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-410 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. SCP-410 is to be provided with appropriate food and water requirements as well as regular psychological assessments. Any instances of psychic activity displayed by SCP-410 are to be immediately reported to Site ██- Psychiatric Services.

Description: SCP-410 appears as a Bengal tiger, measuring 2.5 meters in length and 2 meters in height. It wears a blue bandana around its head and is adorned with a gold chain and candy stick. SCP-410 is the only known instance of an anomalous tiger species that possesses the cognitive abilities and personality of a human.

SCP-410 has displayed a strong sense of intuition, allowing it to predict events and emotions with unerring accuracy. Subjects interacting with SCP-410 have described a distinct feeling of being "read" through the tiger's intense gaze. SCP-410's abilities have led Foundation personnel to classify it as a Type-Green empathic/synthetic telepathic entity.

SCP-410 identifies itself as ████████ ███████, a car salesman previously working in █████████ from which it is believed to have been recovered. SCP-410 claims to have been imbued with its anomalous properties following an encounter with a "hoodoo" practitioner, though no additional information has been obtained on this event.

Addendum: Despite its attempts to conceal its abilities, SCP-410 has displayed significant potential as an asset in the Foundation's mission. Requests for SCP-410's reclassification as a Type-Green reality anchor are currently under review.
