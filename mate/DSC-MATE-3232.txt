Description: SCP-3232 is a male human identified as a reporter. SCP-3232 is known for always wearing a red beanie on its head and sporting a green cross earring in its left ear. Its most notable feature is its constant smile which seems to never wane. SCP-3232 has typical human eyesight, thus needing to wear normal glasses, however, it frequently adorns an LED gas mask which it claims is for protection and style purposes.

SCP-3232 displays an unusual love for adventure and trying new things. This may lead to humorous stories of the subject surviving near-death experiences while bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. The subject's personality is unpredictable, which makes it difficult to anticipate its next move.
