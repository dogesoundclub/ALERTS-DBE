Item #: 5590

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its occupation, 5590 is allowed to operate freely within the city, however it must have a GPS tracker installed at all times in case of any emergencies. All personnel interacting with 5590 must be trained in how to handle robots, including emergency shut off procedures.

Description: 5590 appears to be a robot designed to resemble a firefighter, standing at 6ft tall with a silver and yellow chassis. The most notable feature is its single, green cycloptic eye that glows menacingly. Its mouth appears to be in a constant state of fear, with its teeth gritted and perpetually quivering.

5590 wears a small bucket hat atop its head, as well as a gold chain around its neck. Its eyes are fitted with plain glasses, seemingly a humanizing feature. It has the capability to move and bend its limbs with extreme flexibility.

The robot's personality is somewhat scatterbrained and easily distracted, sometimes leading it to forget important details or appointments. This may prove especially troublesome during crises. However, it is generally good-natured and helpful when not greatly distracted.

Addendum: During a recent fire emergency, 5590 was able to assist in evacuating a group of humans who were trapped inside a burning building. Its lack of fear of flames and ability to manipulate its body to deflect heat were useful assets in this scenario. Nonetheless, 5590 must be carefully monitored to avoid any potential accidents or loss of life.
