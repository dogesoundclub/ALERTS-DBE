Item #: 1678

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: This tiger individual, formerly known as 1678, is no longer a danger to society and requires no special containment measures. However, all information related to 1678 must remain confidential to avoid unnecessary public panic.

Description: 1678 was a male tiger, with an unarranged green head and ski goggle eyes. The subject's most noticeable feature was a frightened mouth that gave the impression of anxiety and fear. On occasions, 1678 was observed carrying a candy stick as a talisman of sorts.

Personality: 1678 exhibited exceptional attention to detail and acute observation skills. Blessed with an intuitive gift-giving ability, 1678 was remarkably perceptive concerning what presents to bestow upon friends and family. However, the tiger's gift-giving prowess can border on obsession, causing anxiety and stress over the quest for the "perfect" present.

Addendum: After serving as a real estate agent for several months, 1678 no longer exhibits any anomalous properties or behaviors that would be considered dangerous. As a result, SCP Foundation has deemed 1678 as neutralized and can be considered an ordinary tiger.
