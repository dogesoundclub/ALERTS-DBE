Item #: SCP-2961

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2961 is to be contained within a secure enclosure maintained at all times by at least two armed guards. Under no circumstances are any personnel to enter the enclosure without Level 3 clearance, and even then only if absolutely necessary. SCP-2961 is to be fed daily an assortment of fruits and vegetables.

Description: SCP-2961 appears to be a farmer of the species Macaca fascicularis, commonly known as the long-tailed macaque. SCP-2961 displays a distinctive pink patch on its forehead, bisected by a vertical part. Its ears are pierced with an emerald jade earring. SCP-2961 appears to wear a crude gas mask fitted with a battery-powered LED light system.

Despite its primitive appearance, SCP-2961 has exhibited a heightened level of intelligence and creativity than would normally be expected of its species. SCP-2961 engages in various artistic endeavors, including sketching, painting, and writing. The subject has even been known to create elaborate sculptures from scraps of metal and wood found within its enclosure.

Interactions with SCP-2961 have yielded little insight into its behavior or motivations. The subject appears to lack verbal communication skills, instead relying on a series of gestures and facial expressions to interact with those around it. It has never displayed any signs of aggression or hostility, but it is advised to treat the subject with caution due to its unpredictability.

Addendum: Recent studies have shown that SCP-2961 may possess anomalous abilities related to manipulating materials around it. Researchers have observed SCP-2961 bending and reshaping materials with amazing speed and precision, leading to the hypothesis that the subject may possess limited telekinetic capabilities. Studies are ongoing to better understand this ability and its potential implications for containment.
