His face is covered in a smattering of spots, giving him a distinctive appearance that sets him apart from his peers. He wears normal-looking spectacles over his eyes, which he often peers over in calculating glances. A short peak cap rests atop his head at all times, making him look like he's in constant motion even when standing still. Adorning one of his ears is a gold earring, perhaps a status symbol or a simple fashion choice.

However, this is merely his way of ensuring that things get done efficiently and effectively.

One of his go-to accessories is a bright red scarf that he often wears draped around his neck. This is not just a fashion statement - it also serves as a symbol of his power and authority in certain circles. There are whispers that SCP-9036 has some sort of magical abilities, though these rumors remain unverified.

All in all, SCP-9036 is a fascinating specimen to study. His strong personality and unique appearance make him stand out from the crowd, and his political tactics are the stuff of legend. While he can be a tricky individual to deal with, those who can earn his trust stand to benefit greatly from their association with him.
