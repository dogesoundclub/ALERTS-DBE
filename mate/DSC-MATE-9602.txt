SCP-9602, also known as "The Impulsive Fast Food Worker", is a humanoid creature classified as a human. This entity stands at approximately 5'11'' tall with a lean and wiry build. Identified by its most distinguishing feature, a mouth spot located just under its nose which is often mistaken as a mole, it has an unsettling appearance. The entity's blue clown eyes are further accentuated by its shaved head which is adorned with a golden earring on one ear. Often seen wearing a red scarf, SCP-9602 is employed in fast food establishments.

The entity exhibits an impulsive personality, often acting on their emotions without considering the repercussions. They have a tendency to make split-second decisions, leading to some unexpected and amusing situations. SCP-9602's lighthearted facade has endeared it to its colleagues, and it has proven to be an excellent worker, capable of handling multiple orders at once with ease.

Despite its docile demeanor, SCP-9602 is deemed a potential danger due to its unpredictability. It is recommended that all personnel exercise caution when interacting with the entity, especially in unfamiliar situations. As with all humanoid SCPs, security protocols are to be strictly observed at all times to prevent unauthorized contact.
