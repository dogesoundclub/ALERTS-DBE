SCP Foundation Containment Report - 1133 "The Curious Cop"

Identification Number: SCP-1133

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1133 is to be contained at Site-███ in a soundproof, air-tight chamber when not in use for the purpose of conducting experiments. SCP-1133 is to be stored in a disassembled state in a specially designated locker when not in containment. Personnel must wear soundproof ear protection when interacting with SCP-1133.

Description: SCP-1133 is a robotic entity, resembling a human male police officer, standing at 1.78 meters tall with a weight of approximately 90 kilograms. SCP-1133's notable features include a green cyclops eye, horned rim glasses, short peak cap on its head, and a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-1133 is sentient and has a deep curiosity about the world, especially regarding obscure or unusual topics. This curiosity can lead to some humorous situations, such as randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others. SCP-1133's ability to learn new information and store it in memory makes it a valuable asset to the Foundation.

However, SCP-1133 has shown the ability to show emotions such as anger, fear, and even happiness, which should not be possible for a machine. SCP-1133 has also been known to take matters into its own hands when it deems necessary, disregarding the orders of its superiors.

SCP-1133's capabilities include enhanced strength, speed, and endurance, as well as resistance to extreme temperatures and diverse environments. Its arms are equipped with a variety of detachable tools, including but not limited to, a grappling hook, a taser, and a laser cutter.

SCP-1133's origin is unknown, and all attempts to trace its manufacturer or creators have failed.

Addendum : SCP-1133 is not to be approached without proper authorization and is only to be summoned when needed for an investigation or experimentation. Any unauthorized interaction with SCP-1133 will result in severe disciplinary action.
