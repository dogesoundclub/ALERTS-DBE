Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be monitored at all times, with weekly psychological evaluations and containment protocols reviewed for effectiveness. Any deviation from normal behavior is to be reported immediately to Head Researcher Dr. █████.

Description: The subject is a female humanoid, identified as a farmer with unique physical attributes. The subject's most notable feature is a purple lip, and her eyes possess vibrant orange eyebrows. The subject has a distinctive rainbow festival hairstyle that is equally unconventional. On the forehead, two color bands are present, with goggles worn on the forehead. Hanging from each ear is a single green cross earring, and a choker accessory is worn around the neck.

Personality traits of the subject lean toward detail-oriented tendencies, often taking this trait to an obsessive and unnecessary level. This behavior is demonstrated through alphabetizing the spice rack and color-coding the closet, among other similar behaviors. Further psychological observations are necessary to determine the root and potential impact of these tendencies.

Addendum: Additional investigation is needed regarding the possible connection between the subject's unique physical characteristics and any potential anomalous properties. Research team members are advised to exercise caution when engaging in direct contact with the subject.
