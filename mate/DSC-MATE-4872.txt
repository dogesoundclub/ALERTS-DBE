Item #: SCP-4872

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4872 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-4872 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher with proper URA clearance. All interactions with SCP-4872 must be monitored at all times.

Description: SCP-4872 is a human male, approximately 32 years of age as of initial containment. SCP-4872 stands at approximately 1.81 meters in height, and weighs 80.7 kilograms. Notably, SCP-4872 possesses a distinctive mohawk hairstyle, with his hair dyed in black and white stripes. SCP-4872's face prominently features spots, which appear to be natural pigmentation. SCP-4872's eyes are an unusual shade of blue, and are likened to clowns' eyes. SCP-4872 is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck, and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-4872 has a unique personality, distinguished by their acute attention to detail and observant nature. SCP-4872's talents have been observed in their gift-giving abilities, with the ability to give the "perfect gift" to those they interact with. As such, SCP-4872 will spend a considerable amount of time researching the recipient's interests, background, and preferences to ensure that the gift is perfectly tailored to the individual. However, SCP-4872's single-minded pursuit of the ideal gift can lead to excessive stress and anxiety, and prolonged periods of indecision and analysis paralysis.

SCP-4872 was initially identified after several reports of their unusual gift-giving prowess began to circulate within the global anomalous community. Subsequent amnestics were administered to cover up SCP-4872's activities, and SCP-4872 was brought into Foundation custody without incident. 

Addendum: SCP-4872 has recently expressed a desire to enhance their gift-giving abilities through anomalous means. Foundation researchers have been evaluating SCP-4872's requests, and have recommended that they be denied. Future interactions with SCP-4872 will need to be carefully evaluated to prevent possible security breaches.
