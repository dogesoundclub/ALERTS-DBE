Item #: 7017

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7017 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel. Due to their position as a train driver, they must undergo routine psychological evaluations to ensure their psychological stability. In the event that Subject 7017 shows signs of distress or abnormal behavior, they are to be immediately removed from their job and placed under closer observation.

Description: Subject 7017 appears to be a human male with normal biological features; however, their facial features are notably unusual. They have numerous spots on their face, which are characteristic of a skin condition that the Foundation has yet to identify. Their mouth appears to be in a constant state of fear, and their eyes are a bright blue color that borders on the abnormal. In addition, Subject 7017 has a gold earring and a silver chain that they wear at all times.

The most noteworthy feature of Subject 7017 is their natural talent for leadership. They are quick to take charge of any given situation, whether it be in their personal life, at work or in a social group. Despite their timid appearance, Subject 7017's personality is assertive and driven. It is rare for them to back down from any challenge or responsibility assigned to them.

There is some speculation within the Foundation that Subject 7017 may have some latent anomalous properties that are yet to be identified. As such, they must be closely monitored and kept under constant observation by Foundation personnel.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Subject 7017 reported feeling an overwhelming sense of dread while operating a train. Despite experiencing no mechanical issues or other incidents, Subject 7017 refused to operate the train any further. Foundation personnel were able to contain and investigate the incident, but no anomalous activity was observed. Subject 7017 was released back to work and instructed to continue surveillance for any strange occurrences.
