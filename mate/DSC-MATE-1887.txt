Item #: 1887

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1887 is to be kept in a secure containment cell at all times. Any personnel entering the containment area must adhere to strict safety protocols and wear full body armor. The cell must be equipped at all times with tranquilizer darts in case of a security breach. Under no circumstances should anyone try to communicate with 1887 verbally or attempt to offer him any sweets.

Description: Subject 1887 is a sentient Tiger with recognizable facial features, including a pair of horned rim glasses and a police cap. He is always seen wearing a silver chain around his neck and carrying a candy stick. His appearance is similar to that of a 1950s detective. Despite his form, 1887 exhibits human-like behavior and a solid understanding of laws and legal practices. As a result, he often works as a lawyer in the supernatural community.

Subject 1887 is eccentric and enjoys coming up with novel ideas despite their lack of practicality. He may often be found devising impractical and outlandish solutions to problems. This can result in moments of unintended hilarity, particularly when other characters are surprised by his off-the-wall suggestions.

Additional notes: Subject 1887 occasionally uses his intelligence and sense of humor to test his human handlers. He should not be underestimated, as he has shown surprising aptitude in legal issues and decision-making. His psychic abilities are also formidable, making the use of psychic inhibitors necessary when experimenting with him.
