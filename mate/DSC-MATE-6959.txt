Item #: 6959

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a tree limb and other appropriate enrichment items. Access to any banking facilities must be strictly prohibited. All personnel handling the creature must wear appropriate protective gear.

Description: Subject 6959 is a male monkey standing at 4 feet tall with black eyes. The creature wears a worn-out retro cap and a two-color band on his forehead. On his forehead, he also keeps a pair of goggles, which are often observed to be tinted red, blue, or green.

Further study revealed that the creature possesses extraordinary agility and intelligence, making him capable of completing multiple complex tasks simultaneously. However, 6959 exhibits little interest in mundane activities and instead spends most of his time daydreaming, often resulting in him being unaware of his surroundings or accidentally hurting himself.

Moreover, subject 6959 has been identified as a banker, which may have contributed to his level of introspection, consistent with other individuals in his profession. However, his proclivity towards daydreaming was confirmed to be more than mere idiosyncratic behavior when he was found to perform deductive reasoning while lost in thought.

Addendum: It must be noted that during staff observations, the subject vocalizes using a whistle, which has been observed to serve an unknown communicative function. The staff must not respond to the noises unless otherwise instructed by the senior investigator.

In conclusion, 6959 displays significant cognitive abilities and has been granted Euclid object classification for containment until a better understanding of his abilities can be gained.
