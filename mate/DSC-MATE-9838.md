Description: 

Subject 9838 is a human female, approximately 28 years of age, with a stocky build and an oblong face. The most distinguishable feature about her face is the prominent, black spots that run down her nose and cheeks. Her irises are an unusual shade of blue, giving her eyes a clown-like appearance. She often wears a pair of goggles on her forehead, seemingly for no reason other than aesthetics. 

When presenting herself, she dons a red cross earring in her left ear at all times, and a black choker is assigned to her as an identifying accessory. Additionally, she is known to smoke cigarettes frequently, regardless of smoking policies or other people's health, this should be taken into account when in close proximity. 

The subject's personality has been noted as being boisterous and humorous to the point of making herself comfortable around strangers very quickly. She is capable of making others laugh with ease and transforming any awkward situation into a joyous one at the cost of propriety. Her ability to match up quick wit with even the most mundane of occurrences is highly emphasized as it can be both a source of comfort and danger.

Addendum: 

Subject 9838 has exhibited knowledge of abnormal animal behavior and anatomy, suggesting a previous paranormal influence. Until further evidence of a connection between her knowledge and anomalous practices manifests, her knowledge is to be monitored and documented.
