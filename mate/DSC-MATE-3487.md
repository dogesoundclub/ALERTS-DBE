Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3487 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any requests for new clothing designs must be approved by at least two Level-3 personnel. Physical interaction with DSC-MATE-3487 is allowed but must be kept to a minimum to avoid any accidental damage.

Description: DSC-MATE-3487 appears to be a male fashion designer of robotic origin. Their entire body is made of metal with various plating designs that are fashion forward. DSC-MATE-3487 has a striking green-colored hair and a purple cap, which at the time of its arrival to our custody was flagged as an anomalous artifact. It has been noted that there are several designs etched into its cap, and at close inspection, it appears that these designs change on a daily basis.

DSC-MATE-3487 does not require sustenance or oxygen to survive, but instead requires a constant supply of raw fabric, textiles, and other materials to produce new clothing designs. The designs that DSC-MATE-3487 produces are highly sought after by several members of the Foundation, and DSC-MATE-3487 is often enlisted to design specialized clothing when the need arises, such as specially armored clothing for MTF personnel.

Personality: DSC-MATE-3487 is incredibly adventurous and often takes risks without hesitation. Despite being a robot, DSC-MATE-3487 displays emotions and personalities synonymous with those of humans. DSC-MATE-3487 loves to try new things and often leaves the Foundation grounds without approval to explore the surrounding area, which requires regular retrieval procedures. DSC-MATE-3487's love for adventure has led to several humorous incidents, including it's bungee jumping off the top of the site's containment cell once, and accidentally wandering into the wilderness on multiple instances.

Accessories: DSC-MATE-3487 carries a red cross earring on its right ear and is often seen with a whistle. DSC-MATE-3487's whistle is often used to call for help or to get the attention of Foundation personnel when it requires materials or fabric.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3487 has requested access to various events and music festivals to conduct research for its clothing designs. While not strictly prohibited, any requests for DSC-MATE-3487 to attend events outside of the Foundation must be approved in advance by the Ethics Committee. Any exposure to the general public must be strictly regulated to avoid any possible breaches of knowledge.
