Item #: SCP-9673

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9673 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with standard amenities. Due to SCP-9673's electrician background and possible electrical manipulation abilities, all electronic devices within its containment cell must be periodically inspected and maintained by a certified electrician. SCP-9673 is allowed to request materials related to learning or education, provided that such materials do not pose a threat to Foundation security.

Description: SCP-9673 is a human male of average height and weight, with distinct facial features. The subject has a spot above his mouth, and wears nerd glasses over his eyes. SCP-9673 has a shaven head that bears a striking resemblance to a monk, and wears an ornamental jade earring in one ear, accompanied by a silver chain around his neck. SCP-9673's personality is characterized by a strong thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing that knowledge with others. The subject enjoys collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials, and spends a lot of time researching obscure topics.

SCP-9673 was first discovered when the Foundation received reports of an electrical disturbance at a local university library. Upon arrival, Foundation agents found SCP-9673 reading a book on electrical anomalies, seemingly unaware of his surroundings. Further investigation revealed that SCP-9673 had the ability to manipulate electric energy, a trait that is currently under investigation.

SCP-9673 is a cooperative subject and has shown no signs of aggression towards Foundation personnel. However, due to its potential anomalous abilities, SCP-9673 is to be monitored at all times.
