Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6250 is to be contained at Site-███ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Daily maintenance is required for DSC-MATE-6250's internal systems. Any malfunction should be reported to the engineering department immediately. During live broadcasts, DSC-MATE-6250 is only authorized to deliver news material approved by the Public Affairs Division.

Description: DSC-MATE-6250 is a male humanoid robot, resembling a typical news anchor. The entity has a green cyclops-like eye, with a red laser-like pupil. DSC-MATE-6250 wears horned rim glasses over its internal camera system, and a green wig with a purple news cap on its head. A goggle sits on the entity's forehead, which activates during physical activities. DSC-MATE-6250's ears are equipped with a red cross earring. The entity carries a whistle at all times.

DSC-MATE-6250's internal systems are designed to mimic human speech patterns and replicate human emotion. DSC-MATE-6250 has shown the ability to display empathy and compassion towards human individuals. This capability can be overwhelming to DSC-MATE-6250's circuits, causing the entity to experience distress, which can lead to a malfunction.
