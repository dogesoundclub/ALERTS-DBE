Item #: SCP-1465

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1465 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, fitted with soundproofing material. Access to SCP-1465's chamber is limited to Level 2 personnel or above, and all visits must be authorized in advance by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1465 is not to be allowed access to any form of communication device or social media account, and any attempts made to contact or interact with those outside Foundation jurisdiction must be promptly reported and dealt with accordingly.

Description: SCP-1465 is a human male of East Asian descent, approximately 28 years of age. The subject's face is characterized by a constantly frightened expression, with wide open mouth, and thick nerd glasses covering his small, dark eyes. The subject's entire head is covered by a semi-organic material of a metallic purple hue, which appears to be bonded with his skin. The source of this head covering is currently unknown.

SCP-1465's personality is highly outgoing, and he readily interacts with his handlers or any other personnel assigned to him, taking pleasure in telling jokes or sharing humorous stories. The subject is highly sociable, and often seeks to be the center of attention, which has led to some difficulty in maintaining confidentiality on Foundation matters.

SCP-1465 is always seen wearing a pair of goggles on his forehead, and a gold earring in his left ear. He also wears a silver chain around his neck and carries a candy stick at all times. It is unknown if these accessories hold any supernatural properties or significance, but they have not yet been observed to exhibit any anomalous behavior.

Addendum: SCP-1465 has shown an ability to manipulate individuals around him, although the extent of this ability is not yet fully understood. It is believed that the subject's naturally charismatic personality may be enhanced by his anomalous properties, allowing him to sway individuals based on his words and actions. Foundation personnel are advised to exercise caution around SCP-1465, and to maintain awareness of any alterations in their own behavior or thoughts while in the subject's presence.
