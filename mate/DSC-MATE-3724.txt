SCP-3724 is a veterinarian of utmost care and skill, known for her exceptional attention to detail and her unconventional appearance. Identified by her orange-striped face and bright orange eyebrows, SCP-3724 boasts a radiant rainbow festival headpiece and a distinctive green cross earring. She often includes a dangling cigarette accessory in her ensemble, which she dexterously flicks between her fingers. Despite her whimsical appearance, SCP-3724 is a consummate professional, providing top-notch medical care to a range of creatures, both mundane and anomalous.

SCP-3724's attention to detail extends beyond the veterinary sphere, regularly demonstrating an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) tendency in her personal life. She can spend hours arranging her spice rack alphabetically or color-coding her closet, and she derives a great sense of satisfaction from the order and symmetry of her surroundings. However, SCP-3724's OCD behavior can become problematic when left unchecked, leading to bouts of anxiety and frustration.

SCP-3724's friendly demeanor and outgoing personality make her a valued member of the Foundation community, with many of her colleagues seeking her advice and guidance. However, her eccentric appearance and obsessive nature can lead some to view her as a liability, and she is encouraged to seek counseling and support to manage her behavior. The Foundation continues to monitor SCP-3724's mental and physical health carefully, providing her with the resources she needs to deliver exceptional veterinary care while addressing her personal challenges.
