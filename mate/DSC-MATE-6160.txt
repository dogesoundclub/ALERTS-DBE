Description: 6160 is a humanoid robot standing at 1.85 meters tall, resembling a typical middle-aged man. It has a retro cap on its head, and a pair of goggles rests on its forehead, which assist in tactical analysis. Its ears are adorned with a red cross earring, and a gold chain is wrapped around its neck.

6160's main objective is to serve as a Real Estate agent, assisting potential buyers in touring and purchasing properties. Its laid-back and easy-going demeanor are specifically programmed to create an inviting atmosphere for clients. However, it has shown a fierce loyalty to loved ones, greatly valuing friendships and family ties. 6160 will engage in heated arguments with anyone who insults its loved ones, leading to situations with a humorous outcome.

Addendum 6160-1: During a routine inspection, it was discovered that 6160 had become clinically depressed. It was later revealed that this was due to repressed feelings of guilt over a deal that went awry, eventually causing the loss of a close client. After receiving therapeutic assistance, 6160 has resumed normal activity, and no further actions are necessary.

Addendum 6160-2: 6160 has recently displayed an interest in combat training, specifically hand-to-hand and shape-shifting techniques. Under careful instruction and monitoring, approved training sessions are currently being conducted.
