Description: Subject 3816, also known as Officer [REDACTED], is a human female with unique physical traits. She bears a distinctive purple lip, which is theorized to be the result of excessive use of chemical dyes or other such substances. Her eyes are covered by standard prescription glasses, and her head is adorned with witch short hair. A set of goggles is consistently found resting atop her forehead, while a red cross earring adorns each of her ears.

In addition to these features, Subject 3816 further accessorizes with a choker and an LED gas mask. These items, while seemingly misaligned with a police officer's normal attire, are reportedly used in the subject's personal life outside of work.

Personality-wise, Subject 3816 is said to be impulsive and act on their emotions with little forethought. This can lead to potentially amusing situations for those around her but has caused concerns from fellow law enforcement officers. Subject 3816 is urged to exercise caution in their actions while on duty.
