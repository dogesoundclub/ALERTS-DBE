Item #: SCP-5750

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5750 is to be kept under standard humanoid containment protocols within a monitored facility. Access to SCP-5750 requires clearance from Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-5750's request to keep their veterinary license should be granted under the provision that its practice is within Foundation-approved animal shelters or research facilities. SCP-5750's gift-giving tendencies should be monitored and potential triggers for extreme behavior noted.

Description: SCP-5750 is a human male who stands at 1.8 meters. Facial features for SCP-5750 include orange stripes and a friendly smile. SCP-5750 wears normal prescription glasses and a red beanie on its head. SCP-5750 is seen wearing a gold chain around its neck. 

SCP-5750 is a gifted veterinarian and its abilities are vital for the Foundation's animal testing programs. However, SCP-5750's personality can be concerning. SCP-5750's gift-giving tendencies can lead to the development of excessive behavior where SCP-5750 becomes overly concerned with providing the “perfect” gift. This behavior can lead to SCP-5750 spending a disproportionate amount of time and resources on the matter. 

SCP-5750's behavior has led to several notices of concern. However, it has not displayed any hostile or harmful behavior to date. Foundation personnel are to monitor SCP-5750 closely and report any abnormal behavior immediately. 

Addendum: SCP-5750 has voiced its interest in using its gift-giving abilities to enhance morale within Foundation staff. A formal request has been submitted to its handler for an upgrade to SCP-5750’s containment status into a collaborative paradigm. Consideration is underway.
