Item #: SCP-6951

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6951 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of SCP-6951's abilities, all electronic devices are prohibited within five meters of it. Any electronics brought into SCP-6951's chamber are to be removed immediately. Only certified Level 2 personnel are permitted to enter SCP-6951's containment area.

Description: SCP-6951 is a human male identified as an electrician named [REDACTED]. SCP-6951 displays no abnormal physical traits other than its attire, consisting of a red beanie, green cross earring, silver chain, two-color band on its forehead, nerd glasses and a normal gas mask.

SCP-6951 possesses a natural charm and charisma that allows it to be the center of attention in social situations. Its sense of humor and willingness to entertain others can lead to humorous results, including spontaneous jokes and silly dances. SCP-6951's personality has proven to be useful in some Social Engineering operations.

However, SCP-6951's abilities also have an anomalous effect on electronic devices within its immediate vicinity. When within five meters of SCP-6951, electronic devices experience malfunctions including power failures, signal interference, and hardware malfunctions. This effect has been shown to extend to battery-powered and electrified objects as well.

SCP-6951's origin and the source of its anomalous abilities are currently unknown. However, SCP-6951 has expressed willingness to cooperate with the Foundation and help contain other anomalous entities.

Addendum: Agent [REDACTED] reported that SCP-6951's gas mask appears to be a normal device, but when he attempted to wear it, it showed signs of developing a hallucinogenic effect. Testing with D-Class personnel confirmed that SCP-6951's gas mask is not a normal device, and it was isolated and contained in a secure storage chamber.
