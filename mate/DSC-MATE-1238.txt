SCP-1238 is a highly unusual human, of which her appearance is simultaneously unsettling and endearing. First and foremost, her head is that of a bright pink rabbit, with vibrant green cross earrings that dangle from her long, floppy ears. Her face is adorned with orange stripes, creating a distinct but striking pattern that contrasts her otherwise pastel features. 

The most striking feature of SCP-1238's face is her VR Rainbow LED eyes that are known to light up and change in color according to her mood or stimuli. Her gaze is disconcerting, often causing discomfort or unease among subjects who come into contact with her. She wears a medical mask over her mouth, speculating that this is due to her immune system's inability to fight off any common bacteria or viruses. 

The personality of SCP-1238 is both charming and forgetful, which could result in some concerning consequences. SCP-1238 can be absent-minded and has difficulty keeping track of time or important events which may affect her work as a security guard. Caution is advised when relying on SCP-1238 as a resource in intense situations. 

Further investigation into SCP-1238's background is imperative to better understand this extraordinary human. As of now, re-testing and monitoring is still in progress, but it has been concluded that SCP-1238 is human, albeit one-of-a-kind appearance. Her unique appearance and personality are in tandem with top-secret urban fantasy occurrences, which may pose a threat to society if left unchecked.
