Item #: SCP-3612

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3612 is to be contained in a specialized humanoid containment unit within a secure facility. Access to SCP-3612 is limited to Level 4 clearance only, and any interaction with the subject must be approved by a minimum of two Level 4 personnel.

During interactions with SCP-3612, all personnel must maintain a respectful and professional manner at all times. Any attempts to provoke or insult SCP-3612 will result in immediate disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-3612 is a robotic humanoid entity standing at approximately 1.9 meters in height. It appears to resemble a male humanoid figure, and is typically seen wearing a bucket hat and a silver chain necklace.

SCP-3612 is known to exhibit a no-nonsense attitude, focusing on upholding traditional values and beliefs. Despite this, SCP-3612 also exhibits a playful side, often sharing stories and jokes that have been passed down through their family or community. It is unclear if SCP-3612's playful attitude is a genuine expression of emotion, or a manipulation tactic used to disarm potential threats.

SCP-3612 is most noted for its position as the leader of a notorious mafia group, and is known to have a vast network of criminal connections. Its exact origins are currently unknown, and the subject has refused to divulge any information regarding its creation or programming.

The presence of SCP-3612 in the criminal underworld poses a significant danger to the public at large, and as such, containment and neutralization efforts must continue until a viable solution is reached.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, following a raid on the SCP-3612's hideout, personnel discovered several documents and records revealing SCP-3612's position as the leader of a major mafia organization. All records have been transferred to the Foundation's records department for further analysis.
