Item#: 6097

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
6097 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a direct line to a secure server. Access to the server shall be restricted to Foundation staff with Level 3 clearance or higher. All incoming and outgoing communication must be monitored for information security purposes.

Description:
6097 is a male humanoid, appearing to be in his mid-30s. He stands at 6 feet tall, and weighs approximately 190 pounds. Interestingly, his head has been replaced with a metal purple casing, with a mouth covered by a medical mask. In place of human eyes, 6097 has VR Rainbow LED lights that function in the same way as human eyes, allowing him to perceive his surroundings.

The Foundation has identified 6097 as being a human lawyer who has developed a thirst for knowledge, and as such spends most of his time reading or researching obscure topics. He has a passion for collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials, and can be quite keen on sharing his newfound knowledge with others, making him ideal for Foundation research purposes.

6097 has shown no signs of aggression or malicious intent, however, his level of curiosity may pose a potential risk if not monitored correctly. Therefore, it is highly recommended that any requests to access his server are to be thoroughly reviewed and approved by a staff member with Level 4 clearance. 

Additional Notes:
Due to 6097â€™s unique appearance not only has he become an important asset to the Foundation for his knowledge but he has also become a reliable informant for the Strange and Anomalous division. As the nature of his work brings him into contact with people of varying backgrounds it is possible for him to be a valuable resource in identifying and possibly containing any anomalous entities that may be operating outside of Foundation jurisdiction.
