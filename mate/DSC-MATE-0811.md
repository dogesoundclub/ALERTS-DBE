Item #: DSC-MATE-811

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-811 is to be kept in a reinforced cage at all times, with a minimum of two armed guards stationed outside the cell. Access to DSC-MATE-811 is restricted to Level 4 personnel, and no contact with the subject is to be made without proper protective gear. 

Description: DSC-MATE-811 is a male monkey of indeterminate species. Its head is covered in green fur that is not arranged, giving it a wild appearance. The subject wears a red scarf and a LED gas mask, which it appears to use to protect itself from any potential threats. Strangely, DSC-MATE-811 has a single gold earring on its left ear. 

DSC-MATE-811's most noticeable feature is the permanent frightened expression on its mouth. Despite its apparent fear, the subject exhibits a highly organized and planner-like personality. It enjoys making plans and following them, as well as spontaneous actions that often lead to humor. It has been observed that DSC-MATE-811 makes impromptu parties and sudden trips for its companions.

DSC-MATE-811's true danger lies in its ability to manipulate its surroundings to its benefit. It has been shown to have the ability to open locks using improvised tools, fashion improvised weapons or explosives, and engage in combat tactics, especially in the area of non-candid self-defense. It also exhibits a remarkable cunning and strategic acumen, making it all the more vital that DSC-MATE-811 be kept under strict and constant containment. 

Addendum: The origins of DSC-MATE-811 remain unknown. Despite best efforts, the subject's containment file reveals nothing aside from its discovery en route from an unknown port to regional zoo. What scant information exist was derived from DSC-MATE-811 itself, whose only verbal communication has been through gestures and sign language, making understanding and interpretation of the subject's communicative abilities difficult at best. Further research and investigation are ongoing.
