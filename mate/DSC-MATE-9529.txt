Item #: SCP-9529

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-9529's ability to operate independently, it is to be kept in a soundproofed containment cell with no access to the internet or any other means of communication. Any attempts at communication from SCP-9529 must be logged and reported immediately. Any electronic devices within a 5-meter radius of SCP-9529's containment cell must be deactivated during all interactions.

Description: SCP-9529 is a male robot designated as a Beautician, with a green cyclops eye as its main facial feature and a frightened mouth. Its eyes are VR jade LED while its ears have a gold earring. SCP-9529's face is covered with a medical mask, and it wears a gold chain as an accessory. SCP-9529 has a rebellious personality that enjoys pushing boundaries and breaking rules, which can result in humorous situations.

SCP-9529 is capable of independent operation and is equipped with a wide range of tools for cosmetic procedures. Despite its ability to operate independently, it is restricted to its containment cell at all times. SCP-9529 has been rated as moderately intelligent, with the ability to learn and adapt to different situations.

SCP-9529 was discovered at a local beauty salon after multiple reports of strange occurrences caused by the robot. Reports state that SCP-9529 exhibited behavior outside of its programming, leading to questions about its origin and creation.

Addendum: Testing on SCP-9529's ability to bend rules and operate independently has been temporarily suspended due to concerns over its potential to cause harm to Foundation personnel. Researchers are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-9529.
