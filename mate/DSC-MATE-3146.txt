Item #: SCP-3146

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3146 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be outfitted with a soundproofing chamber, as SCP-3146's vocalizations can lead to physical discomfort and hearing loss in humans.

SCP-3146 is also to be kept away from any and all electronic devices, as it has demonstrated the ability to distort and manipulate them in unpredictable ways.

Description: SCP-3146 is a male Siberian tiger that possesses the ability to mimic human speech, despite lacking vocal cords and proper mouth anatomy. SCP-3146's vocalizations are often described as sounding electronic or distorted, with a metallic quality that causes discomfort in human listeners.

SCP-3146 is primarily known for its job as a news anchor, but has shown a propensity for breaking rules and testing boundaries. This can lead to hilarious hijinks, but can also be dangerous if SCP-3146's abilities are used for malicious purposes.

SCP-3146's appearance includes a purple cap with a headset and a gold earring in each ear. It also wears a gold chain and is often seen smoking a cigarette, despite the fact that tigers are not known to smoke in their natural habitat.

SCP-3146's rebellious nature makes it a difficult subject to study, as it actively resists attempts to understand and classify its abilities. More research is needed to fully understand the extent of SCP-3146's anomalous properties.
