Item #: 2407

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2407 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber reinforced for physical damages. The chamber must be equipped with a gas filtration system mainly for the safety of on-site personnel. Any experiment or interaction with the subject must be conducted from an isolated area.

Description: Subject 2407 is a male monkey that stands approximately 1 meter tall. The monkey is known to have a frightened mouth and red clown eyes that are often only visible through the gas mask that it wears at all times. The monkey has adopted the appearance of a young hooded male human in a red scarf and a normal gas mask. The true appearance of the subject is yet to be determined.

The subject is considered a formidable villain with a highly analytical and logical personality. It often engages in debates and arguments with others, reveling in the opportunity to display its vast intellect. Its arguments usually revolve around trivial or unimportant topics, which often create humorous situations. Yet, exposing the subject to more complex logic results in violent outbreaks, commanding extraordinary strength and agility.

It is reported that the being is capable of a considerable range of weaponry handling and its speech patterns and accent implies military training. Hence, the subject's origin is unknown, but it's suspected that they might have been a result of a super-soldier experiment.

Addendum: 2407's containment was breached on ██/██/20██ as personnel attempted to conduct an experiment involving stimuli related to complex logic topics. The subject's agility and strength should not be underestimated, although temporarily outsmarted by the personnel, subject 2407 became hostile, resulting in significant damages and loss of life. The subject was apprehended after four hours in containment breach status. A risk assessment report is pending.
