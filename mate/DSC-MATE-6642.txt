SCP-6642, also known as "The Tiger Beautician", is a male tiger who works as a beautician in a small urban salon. Despite his fierce appearance, SCP-6642 values tradition and maintains a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to his work. He takes pride in his skills as a beautician and is known to set a high standard for his clients. 

SCP-6642's striking red clown eyes are his most noticeable feature, often causing his clients to feel unsettled or intimidated. However, he compensates for this by wearing a red beanie that covers his ears and partially conceals his eyes.

SCP-6642's jade earring is another unique feature that sets him apart from other tigers. Its origins are unknown, but it is believed to hold some significance to his family or community. SCP-6642 also wears a gold chain around his neck as a personal accessory.

To protect himself from harmful chemicals and fumes commonly used during his work, SCP-6642 wears a normal gas mask. This has no apparent effect on his ability to provide quality services to his clients.

Despite their somewhat intimidating appearance, SCP-6642 has a playful side and enjoys telling jokes and stories passed down through his family and community. This often leads to humorous situations and endears him to the clients who get to know him beyond his physical appearance.
