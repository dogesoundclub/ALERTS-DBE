Item #: 583

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 583, also known as "The Train Driver," is to be held in a secure containment chamber at Site-██ at all times. Due to its fluid nature and small size, containment can prove difficult. The chamber must be kept clean and safe from any potential escape attempts. Protection for personnel working with the item must be worn at all times. If the item fails to respond or exhibit any abnormal behavior, Site-██ staff are to be immediately informed.

Description: Item 583 appears to be a male anthropomorphic rabbit species with blue clown eyes. It is generally docile in nature and employed as a train driver. Item 583 is typically seen wearing a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring, a silver chain, and an LED gas mask. Oddly enough, when the item wears the mask, its eyes appear larger and more vivid. The size and shape of Item 583 change frequently and at a rapid pace, adding to the difficulty of containment.

Personality: The item appears to exhibit unusually idealistic behavior and has a strong desire to make the world a better place. This trait can manifest in humorous and harmless ways, like protesting a company or cause that it perceives as violating its values. However, if confronted in a harmful, violent way, the item's response can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous.

Addendum: While initially considered a low-risk item, recent internal testing has revealed that the item is capable of exhibiting some level of influence over other SCPs and human subjects. Further investigation is required before a new, more accurate object classification can be assigned.
