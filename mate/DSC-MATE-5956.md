Item #: 5956

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5956 has been placed in a standard Humanoid Containment Chamber within Site-██. Access is limited to Level 3 personnel and above. Communication with Item 5956 must be done via video feed due to its tendency to blend in with mechanical equipment.

Description: Item 5956 is a female human of unknown age with orange stripes on her face, a short witch-like haircut, and jade LED eyes. She wears a medical mask as a mouth covering and a pair of goggles on her forehead. Item 5956 also sports a gold earring and a choker as accessories. Despite its clear human attributes, Item 5956 has anomalous mechanical properties that remain unexplained.

Personality-wise, Item 5956 tends to have a very analytical and logical approach to things, even to the point of being viewed as cold and distant. However, it exhibits a quirky sense of humor that it only displays around friends, preferring to make witty observations and dry humor for kicks. 

Item 5956 is also a skilled mechanic, able to repair and modify any machinery with ease. It would often use its mechanical abilities for practical jokes or to reach normally inaccessible areas. Such behavior makes it a unique asset to the Foundation, as it can often repair damaged Foundation equipment with little fuss. 

Addendum: Item 5956 came to the attention of the Foundation after a small town in ██████ fell victim to a series of mysterious mechanical failures. Upon investigation, Item 5956 was found tinkering with a complicated hydraulic engine that was plaguing the town's industrial output. The Foundation recruited Item 5956 and provided her with a proper job and secure containment chamber in exchange for the use of its mechanical expertise.
