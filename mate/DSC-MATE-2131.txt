Item #: 2131

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2131 (referred to as "The Farmer") currently resides on his farm in the outskirts of the city. No special containment procedures are necessary at this time, as no abnormal behaviors or incidents have been reported.

Description: The Farmer is a middle-aged human male with facial spots and a warm smile. He often wears normal glasses over his blue eyes, and his blonde hair is neat and tidy. His left ear is adorned with a gold earring, and he often wears a bright red scarf around his neck. Despite his unassuming appearance, The Farmer possesses a unique personality trait. He is extremely caring and nurturing, often extending his affections to inanimate objects. The Farmer has been known to name his car, talk to his plants, and even anthropomorphize his household appliances.

Addendum: The Farmer has been observed on several occasions talking to his tractors and other farming equipment, referring to them as "her" and "my girl." It is unclear if this behavior has any effect on the functionality of his equipment, but it is recommended that any machinery used by The Farmer be carefully monitored for abnormal behavior.
