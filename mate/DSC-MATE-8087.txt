Description: SCP-8087 is a male rabbit with distinctive red clown eyes. Despite their unusual appearance, SCP-8087 has been observed wearing a hoodie and gold chain, which it considers to be a symbol of their position within the Mafia. SCP-8087 has demonstrated a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, often cracking jokes and making cheeky comments. However, it's been observed that SCP-8087 can become fiercely protective of their loved ones.

SCP-8087 is a formidable individual, having demonstrated proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and an expert in the air he is assigned to. Although SCP-8087 is small, they possess immense physical strength, which makes them even more dangerous. These qualities make SCP-8087 a valuable asset to their organization.

Personality: SCP-8087's personality is that of a typical Mafia Boss, with a cool exterior that belies their true nature. They are fiercely loyal and protective of their friends and loved ones, often going to great lengths to defend them from harm. SCP-8087 has also been observed to be humorously short-tempered when it comes to insults towards those they care about, making it an amusing sight for researchers to witness.
