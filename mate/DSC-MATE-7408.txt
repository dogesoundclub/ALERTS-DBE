Item #: 7408

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP 7408 is to be contained in a reinforced cell measuring 5x5x5 meters at all times. Access to SCP 7408 is strictly prohibited except for authorized personnel. Any attempts to communicate or make contact with SCP 7408 must be first approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP 7408 appears to be a male rabbit of unknown origin. Despite his small stature, SCP 7408 is notorious for being a powerful and ruthless Mafia Boss. His facial features include a frightened mouth, which usually expresses fear or anxiety. SCP 7408 wears a blue bandana on his head and a golden earring on his left ear. He also wears a red scarf and smokes a cigarette most of the time.

SCP 7408's personality is a unique contrast to his profession. He is known to be empathetic and compassionate towards others, but this often leads to him taking on other people's problems as his own. He feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around him, which can be both admirable and exhausting. Despite his reputation as a mafia boss, SCP 7408 harbors a soft spot for the helpless and downtrodden. This has led to some speculation that SCP 7408 may have a history of criminality rooted in a desire to protect and provide for his community.

Addendum: SCP 7408's eyes are unknown due to his preference for wearing sunglasses at all times. Attempts to remove SCP 7408's sunglasses have been met with extreme resistance, suggesting the possible presence of anomalous properties. More research is needed to ascertain the full extent of SCP 7408's abilities and to more accurately assess the threat he may pose to Foundation personnel.
