SCP-3553, codenamed "The Politician," is a humanoid entity that appears to be an ordinary human male. However, closer inspection reveals a number of anomalous features that set him apart from normal humans.

Firstly, SCP-3553's face is always adorned with a smile, regardless of the situation. This unsettling perpetual grin gives the entity a sinister air that often puts others on edge.

In addition, SCP-3553's eyes are a bright, glowing red color. These glowing "clown eyes" seem to have an incendiary effect on those who gaze into them for too long, causing feelings of unease and disorientation.

SCP-3553's head is covered in a series of green layers, giving it a vaguely reptilian appearance. Strange symbols and sigils are engraved into these layers, indicating that SCP-3553 may be involved in arcane practices.

Attached to SCP-3553's ears is a green cross earring, further highlighting his connection to mysterious and otherworldly forces.

Finally, SCP-3553 is always seen smoking a cigarette, despite the fact that he is frequently in areas where smoking is prohibited. This suggests a disregard for rules and regulations that characterizes his overall personality.

SCP-3553 is infamously difficult to pin down, as his interests and motives seem to change at random. However, he has displayed a deep curiosity about the world, particularly in regards to unusual or obscure subjects. This can lead to SCP-3553 randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, causing disturbances in public settings.

Overall, SCP-3553 is a dangerous and unpredictable entity that should be approached with extreme caution.
