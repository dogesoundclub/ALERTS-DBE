Item #: 7654

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7654 is to be monitored at all times, and is to be escorted by at least one armed guard when traveling outside its place of employment. Standard cover story protocols are to be in place to explain its unusual physical appearance to any members of the public who may inquire.

Description: 7654 is a humanoid entity appearing to be a middle-aged male of the human race. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 190 pounds. Its face displays orange stripes, a clown mouth, and eyes that are red with an unusual iris pattern, all of which are permanent and cannot be removed. The head is parted pink, and the entity has green cross earrings on both ears. While in public, it conceals its mouth with a medical mask.

7654 is employed as a train driver, and claims to have no knowledge of how it came to possess its unusual features. It displays a warm and empathetic personality, but due to its compassionate nature, it has an inclination to interfere in other people's problems and feels a sense of responsibility to help those in need. However, it may also become overwhelmed and exhausted by others' problems, causing a decline in its health and ability to perform its duties.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, 7654 was involved in a train accident that resulted in several fatalities. It was discovered that 7654 had taken on the emotional trauma and stress of its passengers, causing a compromise to its ability to operate the train safely. Communications with 7654 have been restricted, and it is currently undergoing psychological evaluation and treatment. Future interactions with the entity must be closely monitored to prevent further incidents.
