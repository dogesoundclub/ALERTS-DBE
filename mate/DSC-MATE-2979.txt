Item #: 2979

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2979 is to be kept under close surveillance at all times, with a team of armed guards stationed outside their hideout. Any communication or contact with the subject must only be allowed after approval from the highest levels of command. In the event of a breach, Mobile Task Force Theta-8 ("The Capos") is to be immediately deployed to neutralize the subject and bring them back into containment.

Description: Subject 2979 is a human female of indeterminate age, though estimated to be in her late thirties. She stands at 5'9" and has a lean, athletic build. Her most distinctive feature is a series of dark spots that cover her face, which she often tries to conceal with heavy makeup. It is believed that they are the product of a rare skin condition, possibly brought about by exposure to magical energies.

Subject 2979 is the current head of one of the most powerful crime families in the city, and commands a sizable army of loyal soldiers and enforcers. Despite her ruthless reputation, she is known to often wear a smile that belies her true intentions, and is a skilled manipulator who can easily turn others to her way of thinking.

Due to her position, Subject 2979 possesses a strong drive towards achieving her goals, and is not above taking serious risks or sacrificing those who stand in her way. However, she is a shrewd tactician who plans out every detail of her criminal empire with meticulous care, relying on her strategic thinking and organizational skills to stay one step ahead.

It should also be noted that Subject 2979 seems to have some form of advanced cybernetic enhancements to her body, including a metal blue head, and a green cross earring that appears to interface with her neural system. These have not yet been confirmed or replicated, and may represent a significant breakthrough in the field of cybernetics.

Additional notes: Subject 2979 is not to be underestimated, and should be considered extremely dangerous. Her organization has been responsible for countless murders, thefts, and other criminal activities, and she is likely to continue her reign of terror unless contained. It is also unclear whether there are others like her, with similar cybernetic augmentations or magical anomalies, lurking in the criminal underworld. As such, further investigation is recommended.
