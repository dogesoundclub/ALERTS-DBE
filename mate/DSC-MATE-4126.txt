Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:  Subject 4126 is to be kept under observation at all times. They are to be allowed access to all necessary beautician supplies, but any unauthorized equipment should be confiscated immediately. Any attempt to remove or tamper with Subject 4126's LED Gas Mask is strictly prohibited. Any personnel interacting with Subject 4126 is required to undergo a thorough psychological evaluation afterwards.

Description: Subject 4126 appears as a female human with a warm smile. Their eyes are unique, possessing a rainbow LED effect, reminiscent of virtual reality displays. They wear a bucket hat on their head, adorned with a gold earring on each side. Their neck is adorned with a thick gold chain, and they wear a gas mask equipped with a LED display.

Subject 4126 works as a beautician, but they possess an incredibly strong and decisive personality that may come across as bossy or intimidating to others. They have a single-minded approach to their work, with a laser focus on efficiency and effectiveness. This drive can cause tension with others who may not share the same level of intensity.

However, it's their gas mask that has raised concerns among Foundation personnel. Tests have shown the mask to be in working order, but its exact purpose remains unknown. Any attempt to remove or tamper with it has resulted in extreme resistance from Subject 4126.

Subject 4126's bright personality and unique appearance may be attractive to outside parties, so caution must be taken to ensure they don't become a target for malicious interests. They must be monitored at all times to ensure their continued cooperation with the Foundation.
