Item #: DSC-MATE-6486

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6486 is currently employed as a police officer in ██████ County. Foundation agents are to monitor DSC-MATE-6486's behavior and ensure that they do not use their position to seek out potential anomalous entities or phenomena. In the event that DSC-MATE-6486 encounters an DSC object, agents are to be dispatched to the location immediately and DSC-MATE-6486 is to be kept in a state of induced unconsciousness until the situation has been contained.

Description: DSC-MATE-6486 is a 32-year-old female of human origin, standing at 5'6" with an athletic build. DSC-MATE-6486's head, with metal blue skin tone, is marked by several orange stripes while both eyebrow and ear features an orange coloring. DSC-MATE-6486 wears a gold chain necklace and frequently uses a cigarette for comfort.

DSC-MATE-6486 has demonstrated an absent-minded and forgetful personality. Although they possess a high level of intelligence and creativity, DSC-MATE-6486 is prone to become lost in their thoughts and forget appointments or important events. This trait has on occasion led to unforeseeable consequences, such as forgetting orders or objectives while on duty as a police officer.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6486 was brought to Foundation attention when their colleague reported an incident where it was discovered they scheduled a meeting with a potentially anomalous entity on their own. At the time of the report, DSC-MATE-6486 was believed to have no memory of the event.

Dr. █████ has been responsible for communicating with DSC-MATE-6486 throughout their Foundation containment. Despite evidence of cognitive retention, DSC-MATE-6486 appears to have no recollection of the meeting in question. Further study is needed to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-6486's memory loss and to what degree it affects their abilities as a police officer.
