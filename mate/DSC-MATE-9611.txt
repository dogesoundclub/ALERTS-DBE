SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-9611

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9611 is to be monitored on a daily basis through remote surveillance, and any changes in its behavior are to be immediately reported to the containment team.

SCP-9611 is to be contained within a secure facility, and any unauthorized individuals attempting to access SCP-9611 are to be terminated or detained and interrogated as necessary.

Description: SCP-9611 appears to be a middle-aged human male with several unique features. It possesses a distinctive mouth spot on its face, and its eyes are replaced with VR Jade LED.

SCP-9611's head features a peak spike, and it wears a goggle on its forehead as a forehead feature. It also wears a gold earring on each ear, a silver chain around its neck, and carries a candy stick as a secondary accessory.

Personality-wise, SCP-9611 exhibits an impulsive, spontaneous nature, and seems to enjoy taking risks and undertaking potentially dangerous activities on a whim. This can lead to humorous situations, including jumping off cliffs into rivers or lakes without prior planning or consideration.

SCP-9611 was initially identified as a farmer by Foundation agents but exhibited anomalous properties during routine interviews. Further investigation revealed its true nature as an anomalous entity with a penchant for thrill-seeking and risk-taking behaviors.

Addendum: Due to SCP-9611's unpredictable behavior and anomalous properties, it is recommended that all personnel keep a safe distance when interacting with it. All requests for interaction with SCP-9611 must be approved by the Director of Site-██ before any contact is made.
