Item #: SCP-6594

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6594 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a writing desk and typing equipment for his job as a reporter. Any requests for impromptu adventures or party planning must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel. All candy sticks must be approved by a level 2 personnel to ensure they are not spiked with anomalous substances. No other special containment procedures are necessary at this time.

Description: SCP-6594 is a male monkey, standing at 3'3" (1 meter) tall, with a parted pink head and normal glasses. On his forehead, SCP-6594 wears a pair of goggles. He also has a pair of jade earrings in his ears and often wears a gold chain around his neck. SCP-6594 is known to carry a candy stick with him at all times.

SCP-6594's personality is characterized by an organized and planning-oriented approach to life, coupled with a spontaneous side that can lead to humorous situations. SCP-6594 is particularly interested in reporting on anomalous events and is well-known within the Foundation for providing accurate and detailed reports. SCP-6594 has been noted to possess a certain charisma that often leads others to follow him on impromptu adventures or attend his last-minute parties.

SCP-6594 was discovered by the Foundation after he was revealed to the public as a reporter for an anomalous newspaper. SCP-6594 initially resisted containment, citing a desire to continue his reporting career. However, it was eventually agreed upon that SCP-6594's talents could be better utilized within the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-6594 has recently expressed an interest in investigating anomalous recipes and cooking methods. While this is not inherently dangerous, all food and cooking materials must be approved by a level 2 personnel to ensure no anomalous properties are present.
