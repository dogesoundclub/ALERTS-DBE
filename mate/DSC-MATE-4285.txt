Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4285 is to be contained within a secure holding cell at Site-██. All personnel who interact with SCP-4285 are required to wear full-body personal protective equipment, including a respirator mask. SCP-4285 is to be fed a diet of human-grade food pellets and water, which are to be delivered to its cell via a remotely-operated feeding tube.

Description: SCP-4285 is a humanoid entity identified as a human male in the profession of a traffic officer. SCP-4285's face is notable for its clown mouth, blue clown eyes, purple cap with green hair, and red victory band across the forehead. Additionally, SCP-4285 wears a medical mask over its mouth and a green cross earring in its left ear, as well as a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-4285's personality is ambitious, goal-oriented, and self-driven, often taking on more than it can handle in its attempt to reach its objectives. Despite this, SCP-4285 possesses exceptional strategic thinking and organizational skills, allowing it to succeed in accomplishing its goals even in the face of adversity.

SCP-4285's anomalous properties appear to manifest in its ability to manipulate and control traffic flow. Witnesses have reported seeing SCP-4285 giving hand signals that cause motorists to obey its commands, even when it is not in a position of authority. Additionally, SCP-4285 is capable of creating impromptu traffic signs that are visible to motorists and compel them to take certain actions, regardless of local traffic laws.

It is currently unknown how SCP-4285 obtained its anomalous abilities, as no record of its activation or manifestation has been found. Researchers are continuing to study SCP-4285 in an attempt to better understand its abilities and how they can be used to benefit the Foundation.
