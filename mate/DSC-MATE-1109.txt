Item #: SCP-1109

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1109 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject is allowed to retain their job as a fast food worker at a nearby establishment, with a supervisor instructed to monitor their behavior and report any abnormal activity immediately. Any attempts by SCP-1109 to leave their designated work area are to be discouraged by said supervisor.

Description: SCP-1109 is a human female of average height, with blue clown eyes and spots on their face. Their most notable features, however, are the pink rabbit head and green cross earring they possess. SCP-1109 also wears a silver chain and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1109 exhibits a tendency towards introspection and daydreaming, often becoming lost in thought and falling victim to humorous accidents as a result. This trait appears to be amplified when SCP-1109 is in possession of their rabbit head, which they claim has "special powers" and allows them to access an alternate reality.

While SCP-1109 does not appear to possess any anomalous abilities, they have expressed a desire to leave their current reality and enter the one accessed through the rabbit head. It is unknown whether this alternate reality exists or is simply a product of SCP-1109's imagination.

Addendum: Incident Log 1109-01

On ██/██/20██, SCP-1109 attempted to leave their designated work area during a particularly intense daydreaming session. The subject was confronted by their supervisor and quickly became agitated, claiming that they needed to enter the alternate reality within their rabbit head.

Despite attempts to calm SCP-1109, they suddenly vanished from sight. Upon further investigation, a fresh rabbit head was found in SCP-1109's locker, leading researchers to theorize that the subject had somehow merged with the alternate reality.

Efforts to locate SCP-1109 within the alternate reality are ongoing. Until such time that they can be recovered, all personnel are reminded to exercise caution around objects of potential anomalous influence.
