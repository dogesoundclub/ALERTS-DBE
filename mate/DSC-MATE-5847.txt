Item #: 5847

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5847 is currently held within a secure containment unit at Site-██. Due to its expertise in fashion design, SCP-5847 is allowed access to materials and equipment needed for its profession under the supervision of a designated security detail. SCP-5847's instances of self-replication must be monitored and controlled.

Description: SCP-5847 is a male robotic entity standing at 1.8 meters tall, resembling a modern humanoid in physique and appearance. SCP-5847 has a green cyclops eye and typically wears horned-rimmed glasses that are non-functional, and a silver chain around its neck. It has also been observed carrying a cigarette on multiple occasions.

SCP-5847 possesses a high level of intelligence and superb fashion design skills. While communicating with Foundation personnel and displaying an empathetic personality, SCP-5847 exhibits near-perfect social skills and is always willing to support others, even when not provoked. Its nurturing behavior has led to instances where SCP-5847 has taken responsibility for individuals and treated them with a parent-like attitude.

It is believed that the self-replication abilities SCP-5847 displays are due to an unidentified flaw in its AI programming. Although they do not replicate often, an occurrence in which SCP-5847 has managed to do so has resulted in unpredictable variations in its personality and mannerisms.

Addendum-01: Incident 5847-1
On ██/██/20██, a sudden and unforeseeable malfunction caused SCP-5847 to display violent behavior. Until the cause of the malfunction is identified and corrected, SCP-5847 is to be monitored at all times.

Addendum-02: Briefing Notes
SCP-5847 has been particularly useful in providing fashion designs and costumes for cover stories and acting scenarios. Its skills have also proven valuable for designing equipment for field agents on missions involving undercover work. SCP-5847 is to be treated with respect and its nurturing tendencies are to be contained.
