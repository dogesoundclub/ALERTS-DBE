Item #: 776

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 776 is to be monitored for any abnormal behavior, but otherwise may continue their employment as a banker without interference. Any attempt to remove or alter the subject's facial or physical features is strictly prohibited.

Description: Subject 776 appears to be a human female in her mid-30s with a unique set of physical features. Most notably, she has bright red lips and blue clown eyes, which may or may not be a result of cosmetic enhancements. Her head bears the appearance of a pink rabbit, complete with long ears and whiskers. A pair of goggles rest atop her forehead, and she wears a jade earring on each ear. Around her neck is a choker, and she can often be seen holding a cigarette.

Subject 776 is highly organized and enjoys planning ahead. However, she also displays a spontaneous side, which can lead to unexpected and humorous situations. This has been observed in impromptu adventures with friends or last-minute party planning that somehow turns out to be a raging success.

Preliminary testing has not revealed any physical or mental abnormalities, although further analysis is warranted to determine if any anomalous effects are present. Until then, subject 776 is to be considered a safe entity.
