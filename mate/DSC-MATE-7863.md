Description: DSC-MATE-7863 is a male tiger with fur that is predominantly black with white stripes. Its most distinctive feature is its bright blue clown eyes, which glow in the dark. DSC-MATE-7863 wears a blue bandana over its head and a jade earring in its right ear. It is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-7863 displays a frightened mouth and often appears hesitant when approached. However, when it senses danger, it quickly shifts into a strong and decisive personality. Its behavior can come across as bossy or intimidating, but this is only because it wants to ensure that tasks are completed in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

DSC-MATE-7863 was discovered when it was found firefighting in a large urban area, displaying surprisingly advanced knowledge of the job. It was captured and brought to the DogeSoundClub's attention when it was spotted wearing a firefighter's uniform and using equipment and tools that were not designed for use by animals.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7863 displays above-average intelligence and demonstrates the ability to communicate with researchers through non-verbal means. However, it remains highly unpredictable and must be treated with extreme caution at all times.
