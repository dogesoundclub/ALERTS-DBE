Item #: SCP-702

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-702 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. Access to SCP-702's chamber is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Any personnel wishing to interact with SCP-702 must receive approval from at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-702 appears to be a humanoid male of average height and weight. Their appearance is adorned with a short peak cap and a jade earring in each ear. They often wear a red scarf around their neck and a medical mask over their mouth. SCP-702's eyes are covered with normal glasses. 

SCP-702 is a veterinarian by profession and has been detected to possess a very caring and nurturing personality. SCP-702 tends to treat everyone with kindness, often mimicking a parental figure to those around them. This has led some to believe they have acquired reality-warping abilities, though none have been detected in their possession at any point.

SCP-702 enjoys taking care of others, even to the point of risking their own safety. It is advised that personnel maintain a professional distance from SCP-702 to avoid undue emotional attachment or regrettable events.

It is unknown if SCP-702 is aware of their anomalous properties or if they are otherwise affected by the containment procedures. No memory-affecting measures have been taken thus far.
