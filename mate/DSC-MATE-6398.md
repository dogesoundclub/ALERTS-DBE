Item #: DSC-MATE-6398

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6398 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must have a reinforced door with a minimum thickness of 20 cm, and a CCTV camera must be installed inside the chamber to monitor DSC-MATE-6398's activities at all times. The chamber must also be equipped with a special air filtration system to remove any pollen or dander that DSC-MATE-6398 may produce.

DSC-MATE-6398's duties as a Traffic Officer should be performed outside of working hours only, to avoid any possible security issues.

DSC-MATE-6398 is allowed to keep his police cap and jade earring, but nerd glasses are to be removed for security reasons.

Description: DSC-MATE-6398 is a male rabbit of unknown age, standing at approximately 60 cm tall on its hind legs. It has a white fur coat and wears a police cap and a jade earring in its left ear, which mystifies researchers as to what his motives may be. DSC-MATE-6398 is known for its very organized planning and spontaneous side, which can lead to bouts of panic and amusement.

DSC-MATE-6398 is also known to display properties associated with what was believed to be wild rabbit populations. DSC-MATE-6398's personality may be affected by climate conditions, which can quickly turn irrational to some degree. 

DSC-MATE-6398's seemingly carefree and easy-going nature causes a lot of people around it to underestimate its abilities, but it should be noted that this officer often deals with anomalous subjects with relative ease, sometimes in situations where trained agents have difficulty. It has not yet been determined whether or not DSC-MATE-6398's species is a contributing factor in this matter.

DSC-MATE-6398 is able to communicate clearly and effectively in English, though it has not yet been determined whether this is a natural ability or a result of an as-of-yet undiscovered anomalous personality trait.

Addendum: It has been reported that DSC-MATE-6398 has a strong fondness for various types of plants, with carrots being its favorite. Despite this, these items should not be used as rewards or bribes, as it is likely that DSC-MATE-6398 would become too preoccupied with eating and lose focus on its duties.
