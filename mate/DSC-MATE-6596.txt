Item #: SCP-6596

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6596 is to be housed in a secure containment cell at all times. The perimeter of the cell must be monitored by no less than two armed security personnel at all times. Any attempt to breach SCP-6596's containment must be reported immediately to Site Director.

Description: SCP-6596 is a male Tiger with red clown eyes. He wears a purple cap with a headset and a red cross earring. SCP-6596 is also a successful lawyer in the human world, but his true nature as a Tiger is unknown to most of society.

SCP-6596's personality is reckless and impulsive, often acting before thinking through a situation. This behavior can lead to humorous situations or minor accidents, but it also poses significant danger to those around him. SCP-6596 has shown a tendency to show off or impress others, leading to potential incidents of violence.

SCP-6596 is capable of speaking both human languages and communicates with staff and other SCPs through a headset. His motives and goals are unknown, but there is concern that he may try to use his legal knowledge to manipulate humans for his own gain.

Addendum: SCP-6596's containment was upgraded to Euclid following an incident where he breached containment in an attempt to impress a fellow SCP. The resulting chaos caused significant damage to the facility, resulting in the loss of several personnel. It is to be noted that SCP-6596 showed remorse for his actions and is now under strict observation.
