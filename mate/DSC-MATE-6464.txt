Item #: 6464

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Surveillance of all communications and activities is mandatory. Personnel are to exercise extreme caution when interacting with Subject, as he has demonstrated propensity for manipulation and sabotage. Any attempt to remove Subject from containment is to be met with lethal force.

Description: Subject appears to be a male human in his mid-30s, standing at 6'2" and weighing approximately 185 pounds. He has nerdy glasses, a retro cap, and a medical mask that are always present. He bears a striking 2 color band on his forehead and has a jade earring on one of his protruding ears. He is often seen wearing a gold chain as his accessory. 

Subject is highly analytical and logical, with an affinity for debating and arguing with others, often leading to humorous situations. However, his charm and wit have been known to mask his true intentions, as he seeks to manipulate and sabotage others for his own gain. Avoid any form of psychological interaction, as this can trigger his manipulative tendencies.

Addendum: Subject has shown a great affinity for persuading others and can be extremely dangerous if allowed to continue his activities. Do not let his seemingly harmless personality fool you; he is a cunning and ruthless villain with the potential to cause mass destruction if left unchecked.
