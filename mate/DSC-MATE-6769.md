Description: Subject 6769, also known as "The Vet," is a female human with distinctive purple lips and rainbow festival attire.

Despite their volatile nature, Subject 6769 is a trusted ally of the Foundation, possessing a unique insight into the whims and tendencies of unusual creatures. They often communicate with these creatures through body language and other nonverbal cues, making them an invaluable asset to Foundation agents in the field.
