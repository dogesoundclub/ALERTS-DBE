Item #: SCP-8897

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8897 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to personal items such as glasses, hat, earring, chain, and cigarette may be granted upon request by authorized personnel. SCP-8897 must be monitored regularly for signs of emotional instability, and any anomalous behavior must be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-8897 is a human male with nerd glasses and a bucket hat. The subject's forehead bears a two-color band, and they wear a green cross earring, a gold chain, and cigarette as accessories. Despite not presenting any obvious anomalous properties, SCP-8897 is highly attuned to the emotions of others and exhibits a remarkable ability to ease emotional tensions in individuals around them.

SCP-8897 is employed as a mechanic, and their strong sense of empathy has proven useful in diffusing tensions in high-stress situations such as car accidents or disputes between customers. SCP-8897's ability to connect with others emotionally has also led to the subject being highly respected and trusted by their colleagues and customers.

While SCP-8897â€™s emotional sensitivity is not considered a subversion or exploitable anomaly, care must be taken to ensure that the subject does not become overwhelmed or influenced by the emotions of others, as this could trigger anomalous behavior or responses.

SCP-8897 has personality traits of kindness, humor, and a strong sense of appropriateness, making them quick to assess any given situation and respond accordingly. SCP-8897 has never been observed to act maliciously or with ill intent towards any individual or organization. Nevertheless, their anomalous empathetic capabilities make SCP-8897 a valuable asset in understanding and predicting the behavior of anomalous subjects.

SCP Foundation researchers are currently investigating SCP-8897's anomalous capabilities to determine the extent of its empathetic abilities and any potential uses for these skills.
