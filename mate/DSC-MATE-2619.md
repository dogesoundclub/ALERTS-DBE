Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2619 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. A filtered air supply must be provided to DSC-MATE-2619's chamber, as exposure to unfiltered air can cause adverse reactions in DSC-MATE-2619. Personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-2619 must be equipped with a standard gas mask and be aware of DSC-MATE-2619's sense of humor, as they have been known to use sarcasm to confuse and distract handlers.

Description: DSC-MATE-2619 is a male human beautician with the distinctive features of purple metal hair, green cross earring and red clown eyes. DSC-MATE-2619's face also features spots of a dark color. Despite their unusual physical appearance, DSC-MATE-2619 possesses a dry sense of humor that often catches others off guard. DSC-MATE-2619 is also known to deliver deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny.

DSC-MATE-2619's anomalous properties manifest through their need for a filtered air supply, as exposure to unfiltered air can cause adverse reactions including respiratory distress, coughing, and wheezing. The exact cause of this reaction is unknown, and more research is necessary to understand the mechanism behind DSC-MATE-2619's anomalous physiology.

DSC-MATE-2619's personality is generally cooperative, although there have been instances of them being difficult to handle when feeling particularly uncooperative. When interacting with Foundation personnel, DSC-MATE-2619 has been known to use their sense of humor to deflect attention away from serious issues, making it difficult to discern information from them.

Addendum: Personnel are reminded that DSC-MATE-2619 is not to be underestimated, as their unusual appearance and sense of humor should not be seen as a sign of weakness. All interactions with DSC-MATE-2619 should be conducted with due caution and a professional demeanor.
