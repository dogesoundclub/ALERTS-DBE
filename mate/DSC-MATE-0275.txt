Item #: SCP-275

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-275 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, outfitted with a standard supply of food, water, and enrichment materials. SCP-275 is to participate in regular psychological evaluations to assess its mental state and well-being.

SCP-275 is only permitted to leave its containment chamber under strict supervision for scheduled interviews and broadcasts as part of its job as a news anchor, with all audio and visual recordings of these events to be reviewed and approved by Foundation personnel before release to the public.

Description: SCP-275 appears as a bipedal primate with brown fur and normal glasses worn over its large, expressive eyes. It is frequently seen wearing a bright red beanie on its head and a jade earring in one ear. SCP-275 is often seen carrying a candy stick, which it consumes during periods of stress or excitement.

SCP-275 displays a highly analytical and logical personality, often engaging in spirited debates and arguments with others for entertainment. It possesses a sharp wit and a penchant for finding humor in even the most mundane situations.

Interaction with SCP-275 has been known to result in anomalous effects, such as a temporary loss of inhibitions or an increase in creativity and problem-solving skills. Foundation researchers are studying these effects and working to mitigate any potential dangers.

Addendum: SCP-275 has successfully concealed its anomalous nature from the public and maintains a high-profile career as a news anchor for a major broadcast network. Foundation personnel are tasked with monitoring all broadcasts and online content related to SCP-275 to prevent any accidental disclosure of its true nature.
