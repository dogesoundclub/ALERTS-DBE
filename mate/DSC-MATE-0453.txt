Item #: SCP-453

Object Class: Safe

Description: SCP-453 appears as a humanoid robot, standing at 5'10". Its most distinctive feature is its large, green cyclops eye located in the center of its face. SCP-453 also wears a pair of nerd glasses over its other eye, and its head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap. A goggle is always fastened on its forehead, and a red cross earring can be seen dangling from each ear. SCP-453 is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck, which it claims is a symbol of solidarity and resistance.

SCP-453 works as a fast-food worker at a local diner, and it is capable of performing basic tasks, such as taking orders and cooking meals. Despite its unassuming appearance, SCP-453 has a highly idealistic personality, with a strong desire to make the world a better place. It often engages in humorous protests and boycotts against companies or causes that it perceives as going against its values. SCP-453's idealism can lead to unexpected situations, which the Foundation monitors carefully.

SCP-453's origins are currently unknown, but its highly advanced technology suggests a possible extraterrestrial origin. However, more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. SCP-453 has expressed a desire to help the Foundation with its mission of containing and studying anomalous objects, and it has proven to be cooperative and reliable in its tasks.

Addendum: SCP-453 has requested to be referred to by the name "Zim." This request has been approved by the Foundation for identification purposes.
