Item #: SCP-8678

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8678 is to be housed in a standard human containment chamber in Site-███. They are to be monitored at all times by security personnel and a cognitive psychologist who specializes in memory disorders. SCP-8678 is to be allowed to carry on their normal employment as an electrician on-site, but they are not to be allowed access to any electrical equipment outside of their duties without prior approval by Site Command.

SCP-8678 is to wear their silver chain at all times, as it has been found to have a stabilizing effect on their memory

Description: SCP-8678 is a female human of average build and height. They are easily recognized by their silver chain, which is a comfort object used to help them remember important details. SCP-8678's most prominent facial feature is their smile, which is warm and inviting, despite the subject's tendency to be scatterbrained. 

SCP-8678's eyesight requires the use of normal glasses, but no other medical conditions have been found to contribute to their forgetfulness. They have proven to be a competent electrician when focused but can become easily distracted or forgetful, leading to unintentional mishaps.

Addendum: SCP-8678 has recently come into contact with anomalous electrical equipment during routine maintenance activities. Further testing is required to determine if this has had any effect on their memory or cognitive abilities. Research teams are to monitor SCP-8678's interaction with any electrical equipment as a safety measure.
