SCP-9026, designated as "The Impulsive Car Salesman," is a human male of average height and with a rather unique appearance. He is often seen donning a bucket hat and a gold chain, but what truly sets him apart are his VR rainbow LED eyes. These electronic prosthetics give off a mesmerizing array of colors, emphasizing his impulsive and colorful personality.

SCP-9026 works as a car salesman, and his tendency to act on his emotions often reflects in his sales tactics. Despite his quirks, he has managed to sell many cars by using his charm and spontaneity to connect with customers. However, it is important to note that his impulsive nature can occasionally lead to disastrous consequences.

When exposed to unexpected situations, SCP-9026 has a habit of acting without thinking things through, which can sometimes result in humorously surprising outcomes. He is a friendly and talkative individual, and while he may sometimes come off as unreliable or scatter-brained, it is clear that he has good intentions at heart.

In terms of containment, SCP-9026 has proved to be relatively easy to manage. He has shown no signs of hostility, and his colorful personality brings a bit of lightheartedness to the otherwise harrowing nature of the SCP foundation. Although he is human, his unique appearance and tendencies have set him apart as a worthy subject for further observation.
