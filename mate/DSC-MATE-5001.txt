Item #: 5001

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5001 is to be contained in a news studio outfitted with a secure airlock containing an atmospheric filtration system to prevent the spread of any contaminants. All interviews with SCP-5001 must be pre-approved and monitored for potential memetic or cognitohazardous effects.

Description: SCP-5001 is a humanoid female with orange stripes on her face and an orange eyebrow, though her origins and genetic makeup are otherwise identical to that of a standard human. SCP-5001 sports a choker and a bucket hat, but the most notable aspect of her appearance is the LED gas mask worn over her face.

SCP-5001 is a successful news anchor and reporter, though she is known for taking risky actions on impulse. Many of these actions lead to humorous or dangerous situations, such as jumping off a cliff into a body of water without warning.

Despite her apparent disregard for her own safety, SCP-5001 possesses no memory of death or physical pain, leading to a hypothesis that she may be protected by a memetic or reality-bending effect. Further research is necessary to confirm or deny this.

Addendum: SCP-5001's gas mask contains an anomalous device that may enable her to alter live broadcasts and recordings of her own image. Rumors suggest that this device enables her to project copies of her face onto any surface, and at least one eyewitness corroborates this possibility. We must be careful not to underestimate SCP-5001's potential to manipulate our perceptions with her technology.
