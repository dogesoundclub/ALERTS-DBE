SCP-5002 is an anomalous police officer equipped with unique robotic features. This metallic being stands at 6'2 and is adorned with a single, bright green cyclops eye embedded in its steel forehead. The eye shifts and moves like the gaze of a living being, tracking its surroundings with a sinister grace. SCP-5002 has a pair of normal human eyes concealed behind a pair of thin-rimmed glasses, adding to the unnerving appearance of this entity. Golden earrings adorn both of its auditory organs, creating a stark contrast against the metallic plating surrounding them.

SCP-5002 is often seen with a cigarette hanging from its metallic lips, a habit left over from a previous human individual whose memories and personality are believed to be tied to the robot's development. Despite its machine-like exterior, SCP-5002 is surprisingly in touch with its emotions, often showing deep empathy and sensitivity in response to sentimental moments. This quirk may be attributed to the instinctual desire to connect and empathize with the human world it was programmed to police. Music and art, in particular, stir a deep emotional response from SCP-5002, demonstrating an almost human-like appreciation for the beauty of these mediums.

As an anomalous police officer, SCP-5002 is a valuable asset to the Foundation. Although its motives and goals remain unknown, it is evident that this robotic being takes its job as a member of law enforcement very seriously. The Foundation has yet to uncover the true extent of its capabilities or to unravel the mysteries hidden within its metallic form. SCP-5002 remains a valuable subject for further research and understanding, one that the Foundation must keep a watchful eye on at all times.
