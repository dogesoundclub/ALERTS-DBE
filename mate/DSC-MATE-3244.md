Item #: 3244

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 3244 is to be kept under surveillance at all times while on duty as traffic officer. They are to be reminded to wear their medical mask at all times when in the presence of others in accordance with current COVID-19 protocols. In the event that 3244 expresses interest in unusual or potentially dangerous hobbies, interests, or objects, Foundation agents are to step in and discreetly discourage such behavior.

Description: 3244 is a human male of average height and build, with blue clown eyes and a distinctive mouth spot. Their head is shaven except for a monk's topknot, and they are often observed wearing a gold earring in one ear. 

Despite their mundane job as a traffic officer, 3244's personality is anything but ordinary. They possess a vivid imagination and a penchant for the unusual, leading them to engage in hobbies and interests that can sometimes border on the bizarre. These activities can range from writing poetry to creating outlandish cosplay costumes, to collecting obscure and odd objects.

Although seemingly harmless, 3244's creativity and penchant for the bizarre could potentially lead to something much more dangerous. Foundation agents are to monitor 3244 closely for any signs of deviation from safe and acceptable behavior. 

Whenever possible, Foundation personnel are to engage 3244 in conversation in order to keep them occupied and satisfied in their current position. Any attempt to remove or transfer 3244 from their current role must be carried out with extreme caution, as the precise impact of their personality on the broader community is not currently understood. 

Never underestimate the power of the creative mind.
