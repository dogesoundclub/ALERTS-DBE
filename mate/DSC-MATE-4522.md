DSC-MATE-4522, a human female veterinarian with a unique appearance, has been recruited by the Foundation for her exceptional ability to handle and care for anomalous creatures. DSC-MATE-4522 is easily distinguishable by their blonde hair, which supports a pair of large, feathered wings. They can often be seen wearing a pair of goggles on their forehead, with a jade earring dangling from each ear.

DSC-MATE-4522 is a social individual who values harmony and maintains strong connections with others. Their goofy side often leads to humorous situations, such as telling jokes or engaging in playful banter. While they can be light-hearted and approachable, DSC-MATE-4522 takes their role seriously, ensuring the safety and health of all creatures under their care.

DSC-MATE-4522's peculiarities do not end with their appearance, as they are often seen wearing a choker and smoking a cigarette. The reasons for these behaviors have yet to be fully understood, but do not affect DSC-MATE-4522's ability to perform their duties.
