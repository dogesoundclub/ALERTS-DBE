Item #: 6871

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6871 is to be allowed to continue their occupation as a firefighter, but must report to Foundation personnel for regular checkups to ensure they remain stable. Any deviations from their usual behavior are to be reported immediately.

Description: Subject 6871 is a male human with orange stripes on their face, giving them a distinct appearance. Their mouth is often seen in a frightened expression, though this is believed to be a cosmetic feature rather than a reflection of their mood. Their eyes are replaced with virtual reality rainbow LED's, which may interfere with visual-based mind-altering effects. The head is described as 'not arranged green', but this has yet to be elaborated on by the subject.

On the subject's forehead, there is a goggle worn in a protective manner. The subject's ears are adorned with a jade earring. They often wear a red scarf and carry a candy stick.

The subject possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which has been observed in their occupation as a firefighter. However, they have been known to take on more than they can handle, leading to humorous situations where they cannot fit all of their tasks into a single day or try to carry too many things at once.

Although 6871 is currently considered safe, previous cases of self-endangerment should be taken into account. It is unclear whether this behavior is due to a desire for self-preservation or something more sinister.

Further study is required to fully understand the anomalies surrounding subject 6871.
