Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4342 is to be contained within a reinforced cell at all times, with electromagnetic shielding in place to prevent all forms of communication. All personnel entering SCP-4342's cell must wear full body protective gear due to potential chemical damage from SCP-4342's experiments. Any interactions with SCP-4342 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-4342 is a human female with a noticeable purple lip, blue clown eyes, and witch-short hair. SCP-4342 also wears a medical mask covering their mouth and a silver chain. Their ears are adorned with gold earrings, and a two-color band can be seen on their forehead. SCP-4342 has identified themselves as the leader of a local mafia organization.

SCP-4342 exhibits a highly analytical and logical mind and is capable of running a successful criminal organization. However, SCP-4342 also displays a quirky sense of humor, often making dry or deadpan observations that may only be appreciated by those familiar with their humor. SCP-4342 is also known for conducting experiments on human subjects, which have resulted in multiple fatalities and deformities. Extreme caution should be exercised around SCP-4342 at all times.

Addendum: SCP-4342 has expressed an interest in being involved in Foundation operations. While this request has been denied due to SCP-4342's unethical tendencies, the proposal has led to increased monitoring and scrutiny of mafia activities in the area.
