SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-9034 is a humanoid entity designated as a "Theater Manager." SCP-9034 appears to be a human female with orange stripes adorning her face, accompanied by a constant smile. SCP-9034's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, which emit an unusual amount of light energy within the visible wavelength.

SCP-9034's head is of the witch short variation, indicating a high potential for magical abilities, yet to be explored. SCP-9034's ears are pierced with a red cross earring, suspected to have a significant role in channeling of magical energies.

SCP-9034's personality is intriguingly introspective, often found lost in thought and daydreaming. Such behavior may lead to humorous situations, including tripping over objects or walking into poles. SCP-9034's unusual energy signature and magical potential require containment and continued observation within the Foundation's Urban Fantasy Research Division.
