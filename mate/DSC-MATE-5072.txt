Item #: 5072

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5072 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with access to a garden area suitable for farming. Access to SCP-5072 is granted only with written approval from a Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-5072 is a rabbit humanoid resembling a male farmer, standing approximately 1 meter tall. SCP-5072 possesses green hair in a purple cap, horned rim glasses, and sports a red scarf and candy stick as accessories. SCP-5072 is a skilled farmer, capable of cultivating various kinds of produce in a short period of time.

SCP-5072 has a friendly personality, often portraying traits of kindness and helpfulness. They can, however, become easily distracted due to their vivid imagination and creative nature, sometimes leading them to indulge in unusual hobbies or interests such as writing poetry or cosplaying.

SCP-5072's unique abilities allow them to grow unusually large crops, with some specimens measuring up to 10 times their normal size. Although this ability can be useful, it also poses a risk to the general populace if SCP-5072's produce were to enter the food market.

SCP-5072 was discovered in a small rural town in the Midwest, where they were renowned for their excellent farm products. Foundation personnel were alerted to this anomaly after reports of unusually large produce started surfacing in the town. SCP-5072 was subsequently captured and contained for further study.

Addendum: SCP-5072 was granted permission to cultivate their crops in a designated garden area within the Foundation's facility. SCP personnel were to review and approve all products before their distribution into the food market. Testing revealed that SCP-5072's crops pose no danger to the general populace and are, in fact, highly nutritious. As such, SCP-5072 was granted access to more extensive farming equipment, leading to an increase in crop yeilds.
