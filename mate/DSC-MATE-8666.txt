Description: SCP-8666 appears to be a normal human female in her mid-twenties. However, SCP-8666 has been observed wearing a black hoodie as a form of uniform as a traffic officer, and is always seen wearing a gold chain around her neck. On duty, SCP-8666 also wears a normal gas mask, which is typical for urban environments.

SCP-8666 has even been known to create elaborate cosplay costumes, often constructing them from found materials.

SCP-8666 appears to have a firm grasp on reality and has not demonstrated any overt signs of mental instability. However, due to their unusual interests and eclectic personality, Senior Staff have deemed SCP-8666 to be a potential risk for anomalous activity.

Addendum: SCP-8666 recently discovered an anomalous object in a routine traffic stop. The object in question was contained and removed from the area, but SCP-8666's interest in anomalous objects has become a concern for Senior Staff. Further monitoring and evaluation are recommended.
