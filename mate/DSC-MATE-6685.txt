Subject 6685, also known by the moniker "The Purple Agent", is a human real estate agent with a striking appearance. His head is encased in a metallic purple construct, giving him an otherworldly aspect that is both alluring and disconcerting. The fluorescent spots that adorn his face only add to the enigmatic quality of his appearance. Donning a pair of nerd glasses that glint in the light and a gold earring that jangles as he moves, he stands out in any crowd.

The Purple Agent's style wouldn't be complete without his signature red scarf, which he wears regardless of the temperature. In his free time, he can often be found taking a leisurely smoke break, the sweet scent of his cigarette wafting through the air.

Despite his unique appearance, The Purple Agent's personality truly sets him apart. His quick wit and love of debate have earned him a reputation as a master wordsmith, and he is quick to engage in a verbal sparring match with friends and acquaintances alike. His playful arguments are often the source of much humor, as they are rarely meant to be taken seriously.

Subject 6685 may be enigmatic and unconventional, but his charm and wit have made him a beloved figure in the urban fantasy community.
