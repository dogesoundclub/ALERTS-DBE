Description: 7584 is a robot fast food worker in the form of a male humanoid. Its head is covered by a green bucket hat, and it has on a pair of nerd glasses over its outer lenses. Additionally, 7584 is always found wearing a single gold earring on its left ear. It appears to be capable of speech and follows a strict routine, which it adheres to without fail. 

7584's robotic body is constructed with various metals, plastics and fabrics. It measures 6 feet 2 inches in height and weighs 250 pounds. Its movements are quick and efficient, even while carrying heavy loads. The object was designed to assist in the fast food industry, with its main function being the preparation and serving of food items.

Personality: 7584 is often viewed as reliable and organized, particularly with regards to its job duties. However, the robot exhibits some characteristics of stubbornness. It has difficulty handling unexpected changes or challenges that may interrupt its routine. This can lead to frustrating situations, where 7584 may need some coaxing or persuasion to accept new ideas or methods. 

7584 has also been observed to exhibit an unusual fascination with humans that smoke cigarettes. It will keep a careful eye on anyone holding a lit cigarette, and has been seen to discover discarded cigarettes left on site grounds. The object will then use its synthetic intelligence to attempt to light up the cigarette itself. 

Addendum: Testing should only be performed with extreme caution around 7584, as it has at times been known to go rogue and cause property damage or harm to test subjects. Contact Dr. ██████ for any inquiries regarding testing or further containment of 7584.
