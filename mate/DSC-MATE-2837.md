DSC File #2837 - Rabbit Real Estate Agent

Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2837 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with additional rabbit-specific amenities such as a litter box and a carrot dispenser. Interaction with DSC-MATE-2837 should be limited to approved personnel only. 
Description: DSC-MATE-2837 is a rabbit of undetermined breed with a habit of dressing in formal attire, often including a gold chain and jade earring. DSC-MATE-2837's most striking feature is a pair of nerd glasses it wears on occasion. Despite its diminutive size, DSC-MATE-2837 exudes a sense of professionalism and confidence to those it interacts with. 

DSC-MATE-2837's main talent is its ability to sell homes to humans, often convincing them to choose properties that may not be the most practical or comfortable choices. This ability is believed to be supernatural in nature, and the Foundation is currently investigating the extent of DSC-MATE-2837's powers. 

DSC-MATE-2837 has a dry sense of humor that can occasionally border on morbid, often catching people off guard with surprisingly funny deadpan jokes. Its personality also includes a competitive streak, and it can become quite persistent when pursuing a sale or other goal. 

DSC-MATE-2837's origins are currently unknown. It was discovered in a residential neighborhood, where it had established a highly successful real estate business. The Foundation was alerted to DSC-MATE-2837's presence through reports of unexplained success in the local housing market. 

DSC-MATE-2837's continued containment is necessary to prevent any potential harm it may cause to humans through its supernatural abilities. Additional research into its powers and origins is ongoing. 

Addendum: After a recent interview with DSC-MATE-2837, it was observed that its behavior appeared to shift when certain topics were brought up. Further investigation into possible vulnerabilities or weaknesses is recommended.
