Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2786 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All communication with SCP-2786 must be monitored for any suspicious activity.

Description: SCP-2786 is a human male that exhibits several unusual physical features. The subject's face bears bright orange stripes and a frightened mouth, with eyes resembling ski goggles. SCP-2786 also wears a bucket hat and a green cross earring. 

SCP-2786 is a farmer by profession, and displays standard human capabilities, apart from the aforementioned physical anomalies. However, the most remarkable aspect of SCP-2786 is its impulsive behavior, which has led to several instances of humorous situations.

SCP-2786 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but it is recommended that communication with the subject be limited to essential information only. Any attempts by SCP-2786 to contact individuals outside of the Foundation should be reported to Site-██ security immediately. 

Addendum: 

SCP-2786 has been observed wearing a gold chain as a personal accessory during several occasions. It is currently unknown whether this accessory has any anomalous properties, and further investigation is recommended.
