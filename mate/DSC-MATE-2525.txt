SCP-2525 is a human female of unknown origin with a fascinating ability to predict the future. As a real estate agent, she uses her uncanny intuition to make informed decisions and seal the deal with her clients. The subject wears a retro cap and a silver chain, complementing her mysterious yet stylish appearance.

However, SCP-2525 is not just any ordinary agent. Her psychic powers sometimes make her seem eerie and uncomfortable to be around. Her ability to sense people's emotions and thoughts is particularly alarming, leading some to believe that she may not be entirely human.

It is unclear what triggers her visions, but she has on several occasions predicted outcomes with near-perfect accuracy. Despite her eerie abilities, SCP-2525 is friendly, courteous, and professional, making her an ideal real estate agent to work with.

Further research is required to determine the extent of her powers, as she may pose a threat to society if her abilities fall into the wrong hands. SCP-2525's cigarette smoking habit is another area of concern, as it may impact her overall well-being and predispose her to various health conditions.

In summary, SCP-2525 is a unique and intriguing individual with the potential to impact the world in unimaginable ways. The Foundation will continue to monitor her closely and ensure that she does not cause harm to herself or others.
