Item #: 1779
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1779 is to be kept under observation at all times within his place of employment as Theater Manager. Any attempts to remove or relocate the subject must be approved by the SCP Foundation’s Site Director. All personnel interacting with the subject are advised to utilize protective gear to prevent any potential exposure.

Description: Subject 1779 appears to be a male human, albeit with an unusual physical appearance. He is identified by a prominent “mouth spot” on his upper lip, which is often covered by a medical mask. The subject also wears silver chains and frequently sports a short peak cap, along with large glasses commonly seen as nerd glasses.

Subject 1779's personality is characterized by an extreme sense of detail-orientation leading to obsessive behavior, exemplified by the alphabetization of his spice rack or the color-coding of his closet. This tendency can manifest in unexpected ways and appears to be a defining aspect of his character.

Reports have emerged of the subject displaying anomalous phenomena, including minor spontaneous combustion and localized distortions in reality. These events seem to be connected to outbursts of obsessive behavior, leading to fears that the subject endangers his surroundings.

Addendum 1779-A: From a recent interview with Subject 1779, he revealed his awareness of the SCP Foundation and expressed a desire to collaborate with its personnel in identifying and containing other anomalous individuals. It is uncertain whether the subject's offer is genuine or a ploy to further his obssessive behavior.
