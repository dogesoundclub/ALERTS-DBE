Item #: SCP-4599

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4599 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to SCP-4599's profession as a real estate agent, they are to be monitored for any attempts to manipulate or influence others to purchase or lease anomalous properties. SCP-4599 is allowed access to reading materials and recreational activities, with approval from Site personnel. Interaction with SCP-4599 is limited to authorized research personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-4599 is a human female with distinctive facial features: spotted skin and purple lips. SCP-4599's eyes are cybernetic and glow jade green with the words "VR" displayed on them. SCP-4599's hairstyle and accessories resemble that of a 2000s schoolgirl, complete with green cross earrings, a choker, and an LED gas mask.

SCP-4599 exhibits a nurturing and caring demeanor, often taking care of others as if they were her own children. This trait has led to humorous situations, including SCP-4599 mothering her fellow SCPs as well as Foundation personnel.

SCP-4599 possesses an anomalous ability to influence others' purchasing decisions. SCP-4599 can convince individuals to purchase or lease anomalous properties without the person realizing the anomalous nature of the property. Due to this ability, SCP-4599 has been deemed a potential threat to Foundation secrecy and is to be carefully monitored.

Addendum: SCP-4599 has expressed interest in assisting the Foundation in finding secure locations for anomalous entities and objects. The Ethics Committee is currently discussing the possibility of utilizing SCP-4599's real estate expertise, with proper monitoring and safeguards in place.
