SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-8818

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8818 is to be monitored at all times and contained within a 5x5 meter standard humanoid containment cell. A one-way observation window is to be installed for regular monitoring. SCP-8818 is permitted recreational access to approved music and artistic materials, but is to be monitored during use. Any emotional outbursts or abnormal behavior must be reported to the nearest Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-8818 appears to be a male humanoid with orange stripes on the face and a clown mouth. The subject's eyes are red clown eyes and bear no pupils. The head resembles a Monk, and the ears showcase a single gold earring. An ornamental silver chain is also present.

SCP-8818 displays an emotionally-driven personality, visibly moved by sentimental moments in movies and TV shows. The subject shows a fondness for music and art that evokes strong feelings, exhibiting angst without obvious provocation. Interaction with others reveals an amiable personality, growing sad and tearful at the slightest trigger of negative emotions. Any attempts to console SCP-8818 have proven futile.

SCP-8818 was initially discovered as a traffic officer, causing multiple traffic accidents unintentionally. Upon apprehension and containment, tests reveal no signs of any anomalous activity.

Addendum: After multiple emotional breakdowns and self-harm attempts, it was noted by on-site staff that SCP-8818's emotional state starts to influence the emotional stability of staff members. Due to this observation, personnel are advised to limit interaction with SCP-8818 to designated personnel only. A request to transfer SCP-8818 to a specialized containment facility is currently under review.
