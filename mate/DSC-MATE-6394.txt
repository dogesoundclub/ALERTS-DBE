Item #: 6394

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6394 is to be contained in a secure animal enclosure at Site-██. The enclosure must be kept closed and locked at all times, with at least two armed guards stationed outside. Access to SCP-6394's containment requires Level-3 clearance and written authorization from Site Director.

SCP-6394 requires daily medical evaluations as it serves as a valuable resource in supporting the health of other anomalies within the facility. SCP-6394's emotions must be monitored at all times as it may prove impulsive and unpredictable.

Description: SCP-6394 is a male monkey with vibrant blue clown eyes and a head adorned with a doge hat. The creature stands at roughly 1.5 meters tall and weighs approximately 45 kilograms. SCP-6394 is capable of basic communication with human handlers, but it is not known if it possesses advanced language skills.

SCP-6394 works as a veterinarian, but its particular brand of impulsive behavior makes it prone to making spontaneous decisions. His antics can easily surprise or amuse his colleagues, leading to humorous and often perplexing situations.

SCP-6394 displays an unusual level of confidence and tends to act with a self-assured demeanor. Its actions often reflect its emotions, with little regard for logical reasoning. SCP-6394 is content within its containment and does not appear to be overtly malicious or aggressive. Nevertheless, handlers are advised to remain vigilant and alert at all times.

Addendum: SCP-6394's spontaneous behavior has recently resulted in an altercation with a nurse when it unexpectedly grabbed her hand while performing a medical exam. Medical staff had to be called in to sedate SCP-6394, and due to the incident, Level-3 clearance is now required to interact with SCP-6394.
