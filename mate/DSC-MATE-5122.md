Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5122 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. They are to be provided with basic amenities and allowed access to a small garden for their farming needs. Any attempts to leave the containment cell must be met with immediate apprehension and re-containment.

Description: DSC-MATE-5122 is a male humanoid of the human species. They possess a unique set of physical features, including a mouth spot and clown mouth located on their face, and red clown eyes. Their head is not arranged in a typical human fashion and is instead a green, unorganized mess. DSC-MATE-5122 also wears a jade earring and a silver chain around their neck, as well as carrying a candy stick as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-5122's personality is described as hands-on and practical. They tend to fix objects in unconventional ways, preferring to use duct tape or makeshift solutions to complex problems. It is unknown if this trait is tied to their anomalous qualities.

DSC-MATE-5122's primary function is farming, and they require access to soil and plants to carry out this task. They have a deep connection to nature and have demonstrated the ability to grow crops in even the harshest conditions. However, DSC-MATE-5122's anomalous properties have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if they possess further abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5122 came to Foundation attention when reports of strange, clown-like figures appearing in rural areas began to surface. DSC agents were able to locate and contain DSC-MATE-5122 without incident. Further investigation into the phenomenon is ongoing.
