Item #: SCP-6979

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6979 is to be kept in a reinforced cell at all times when not performing its duties as a veterinarian. All personnel tasked with interacting with SCP-6979 must be trained in animal handling and must wear protective gear at all times. In the event of a containment breach, lethal force is authorized.

Description: SCP-6979 is a male tiger approximately 2 meters in length with distinct facial and bodily features. Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-6979 has displayed a relatively calm disposition towards human beings, although instances of aggression have been noted during periods of distress.

SCP-6979's facial features display a frightened mouth, normal glasses, and a medical mask covering its snout. Additionally, SCP-6979 wears a police cap with a two-color band on its forehead and a jade earring in each ear. Around its neck, SCP-6979 wears a red scarf.

Notably, SCP-6979 has displayed an affinity for deadpan humor, often catching people off guard with its dry wit. Whether it is aware of its comedic abilities is currently unknown.

SCP-6979's abilities include heightened senses, agility, and strength, and it has been noted to communicate with other animals through a series of grunts and growls. SCP-6979 has also shown the ability to shift into a humanoid form, although this ability is uncontrollable and triggered by extreme stress.

Addendum: SCP-6979 has historically been compliant with Foundation demands, with the exception of one incident in which it attempted to escape containment. During the event, SCP-6979 shifted into a humanoid form and was observed to possess enhanced physical abilities, including increased speed and durability. The incident was quickly resolved using lethal force, resulting in SCP-6979's full cooperation with Foundation demands.
