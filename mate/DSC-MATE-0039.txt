Item #: SCP-39

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-39 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-39 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and all interactions with SCP-39 must be monitored via video surveillance. SCP-39 is to be provided with a traffic officer's uniform for comfort.

Description: SCP-39 appears to be a male human with orange stripes on his face and a peak spike on his head. He wears a jade earring on each ear, a red scarf around his neck, and is often seen with a candy stick in his mouth. SCP-39's primary job before containment was that of a traffic officer, and he has retained this occupation since capture.

SCP-39's personality is that of an organized and reliable individual, although he can be prone to stubbornness when it comes to accepting new ideas. SCP-39 struggles with letting go of routines and can become agitated when faced with changes or challenges that disrupt his perceived order. Despite this, SCP-39 has shown instances of adaptability when presented with new protocols.

SCP-39's anomalous property appears to stem from his candy stick, which he has been seen to consume frequently. Testing has demonstrated that the candy stick provides SCP-39 with a calming effect, despite not containing any known narcotics or sedatives. Further study is required to ascertain the nature of this effect.

Addendum: As SCP-39 is an ordinary human who happened to consume an anomalous object, and their effect appears to be beneficial to the Foundation staff, a request for further privileges of freedom in the Site was made.  The request was granted by the O5 council.
