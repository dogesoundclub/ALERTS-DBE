DSC-MATE-913, also known as "The Gift Giver," is a male human with a peculiar mouth spot on his otherwise unremarkable face. His hair is a common shade of blonde and his ears are adorned with a green cross earring. DSC-MATE-913 can most commonly be found masquerading as a car salesman, but do not be deceived by his mundane appearance. DSC-MATE-913 possesses a keen eye for detail and is incredibly observant, making him an expert gift-giver. However, his obsession with finding the perfect gift can consume him, leading him to spend hours, sometimes even days, agonizing over what to buy. Despite this peculiarity, DSC-MATE-913 has proven to be a valuable asset to the containment efforts of other DSCs who require cunning and creative solutions. Approach with caution but do not hesitate to solicit his gift-giving expertise if necessary.
