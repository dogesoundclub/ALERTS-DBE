SCP-288, also known as "The Farmer", is a human male of average height and build. His most prominent feature is the orange stripes on his face, which contrast sharply with his otherwise normal complexion. He also wears a gold earring in one ear, adding to his somewhat eccentric appearance.

His head is topped with a distinctive peak spike, making him easily recognizable from a distance. Despite the intimidating appearance, his smile is warm and inviting, putting those around him at ease.

SCP-288 can often be found wearing a medical mask over his mouth, giving the impression that he is either ill or concerned about contamination. This is likely due to his obsessive tendency to remain organized and in control of his surroundings, which can sometimes manifest as a fear of germs or disorder.

Despite his quirks, SCP-288 is a highly capable individual who excels at managing projects and delegating tasks to others. While his approach may come across as bossy or controlling at times, it is always done with the best intentions and a desire to see things run smoothly.

SCP-288's skills and demeanor have made him a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in situations where organization and efficiency are of the utmost importance. As such, he is highly regarded by his fellow operatives and respected for his contributions to the cause.
