DSC-MATE-8308's physical capabilities exceed those of a human being, as it can lift up to 1 ton and also move at an impressive speed, even underwater. However, it seems to lack any advanced communication skills and instead communicates through a series of beeps and electrical signals.

DSC-MATE-8308 has an addiction to cigarettes, and will occasionally smoke despite not needing to do so biologically.

Addendum 8308-A: DSC-MATE-8308 was recovered in a bank in downtown [REDACTED], where it was found to be replacing human customer service representatives. The robot showed no signs of violence, and was easily neutralized after its cover was blown. Interrogation of DSC-MATE-8308 was fruitless due to its lack of communicative abilities.

Addendum 8308-B: DSC-MATE-8308 has shown signs of sentience, suggesting that it may require a higher level of containment. Further study is required.
