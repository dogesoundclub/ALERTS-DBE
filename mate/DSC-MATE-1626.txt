Item #: SCP-1626

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1626 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-1626 is to be granted only with approval from at least 2 Level 3 personnel. SCP-1626's real estate business is to be monitored to ensure that no anomalous activity takes place.

Description: SCP-1626 is a human male with distinctive orange stripes running along his face. He possesses ski goggle eyes, a blue bandana on his head, and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-1626 wears a gold chain but often covers its face with a normal gas mask to prevent inhaling contaminants. Despite SCP-1626's seemingly anomalous features, it is currently believed that SCP-1626 is merely a human with a unique aesthetic.

SCP-1626 works as a real estate agent in [REDACTED]. SCP-1626 is an energetic and enthusiastic individual, which has led to comedic situations in which SCP-1626 gets overly excited about something that others may find less interesting. This trait, while harmless, has contributed to SCP-1626's odd behavior.

SCP-1626 has no physical anomalies, and there are no indications that SCP-1626 has any memetic effects. SCP-1626 cooperates with Foundation personnel and has no knowledge of his classification as an SCP. Further research on the purpose of SCP-1626's gas mask and other accessories are ongoing.

Addendum 1: SCP-1626 has no known connections to any known anomalous organizations, but investigations into SCP-1626's past activities are still underway.

Addendum 2: SCP-1626's real estate business is a front, covering a known hub for alienated objects. Further implications of SCP-1626's knowledge of the site and its objects are still under ongoing research protocols.
