SCP Foundation Containment Report â€“ 6104

Special Containment Procedures:
Due to his anomalous properties, 6104 is to be contained within a secure enclosure consisting of steel bars and high-voltage electric wire. Researchers and employees are to wear protective gear to avoid any potential harm while within the vicinity of this entity. Routine checkups are to be done to ensure integrity of the containment.

Description:
SCP 6104 is a male monkey, standing at a height of approximately 3 feet tall and weighing about 50 pounds. Its physical appearance is similar to that of a juvenile monkey, with parted pink hair on its head and a distinct set of blue clown eyes. His most notable accessory is a red scarf that has been observed to produce small visible sparks when rubbed against a hard surface.

Personality:
Despite his animalistic form, 6104 has demonstrated moments of human-like enthusiasm and excitement. This behavior can manifest in the form of wild jumps, playful swinging, and, in extreme cases, hyperactivity. His excitement has shown to be contagious among personnel and can cause humorous scenarios.

Hazard Level: Euclid

Additional Notes:
SCP-6104 has been noted to exhibit the ability to manipulate and generate a type of energy, currently unidentifiable by current technology. This energy has the ability to create small discharges of electricity, which have been captured on video footage.

Studies are ongoing to identify the nature and implications of this energy-creating ability. Until then, 6104 is to remain under continuous surveillance within its secure containment to avoid any potential hazardous situations.
