Item #: 4981

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4981 is to be stationed as a Police Officer in a department which deals with urban fantasy cases. SCP-4981 is to be provided with an LED gas mask at all times while on duty.

Description: SCP-4981 is a human male with normal blonde hair and normal glasses, identified as a police officer. The subject displays a unique facial feature which includes orange stripes patterned across his face and a frequent expression of fear on his mouth. SCP-4981 is often spotted wearing a gold chain around his neck.

SCP-4981 has an exceptional level of observation skills, and is extremely attentive to detail. This trait makes him an excellent gifter, however, he has a tendency to agonize extensively about selecting the perfect gift for individuals. SCP-4981 displays fear in multiple situations, and the LED gas mask given to him helps the subject to not panic as frequently.

SCP-4981 has displayed no anomalous effects on those individuals who come into direct contact with him, and has not shown any hostility towards the foundation.

Addendum: SCP-4981 has been reassigned to departments with higher cases of urban fantasy sightings in order to utilise his observation skills to a greater extent.
