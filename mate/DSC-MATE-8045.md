The subject is to be provided with all necessary equipment and supplies for her job as a farmer. Any contact with the subject must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 8045 is a female human with distinct features that portray a pink rabbit on her head. Her face features orange stripes and a broad smile. Her forehead bears a two-color band, and she adorns her ears with gold earrings. Subject 8045â€™s traits may seem unusual for a human, but her species remains as such.

Subject 8045's appearance is incomplete without the silver chain that she wears as an accessory. However, what makes Subject 8045 stand out among others is her personality. Although she usually presents a nonchalant and relaxed demeanor, she can be fiercely loyal and protective of anyone close to her. Insult her friends or loved ones, and she will not hesitate to engage in an argument with the apparent offender.

Addendum: Subject 8045 is the first of her kind to have been discovered. The subject willingly came forward upon discovering her abilities to transform her features into that of a pink rabbit. The Foundation has deemed it necessary to keep Subject 8045 under surveillance to ensure the subject's full abilities and potential are studied.
