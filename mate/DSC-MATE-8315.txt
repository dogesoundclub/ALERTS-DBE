Item #: SCP-8315

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8315 is to be held within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its abilities, it is to have no access to tools or objects that could aid it in manipulating or repairing objects. Any requests for repair items are to be carefully considered before approval. Strict security protocol is to be maintained at all times when interacting with SCP-8315.

Description: SCP-8315 is a human male, identified only as a banker. The most notable feature of SCP-8315 is its orange-striped facial markings, and ski goggle-like eyes. It wears a purple cap with a headset and a gold earring in one ear. It carries a cigarette at all times.

SCP-8315 possesses a unique ability to fix complex machines, objects, and systems through unconventional means. It shows a remarkable degree of ingenuity in its approaches, often using things like duct tape, paper clips, or other cheap materials to make a makeshift solution work. SCP-8315 seems to have little regard for traditional repair methods or safety protocols, often improvising to solve a problem with disregard for the risks involved.

SCP-8315 has significant potential for secret infiltration operations or espionage, becoming a potential asset to field agents. However, due to its reckless nature and unpredictable behavior, SCP-8315 is considered a risk to the safety and stability of any operation.

Personality: SCP-8315 is practical and hands-on in its approach to everything, often adopting a "MacGyver-like" approach to solve problems. It is fearless in its experimentation, often disregarding safety protocols in order to get the job done. While this makes it an excellent resource for the Foundation, SCP-8315's disregard for established protocols creates significant security risks. SCP-8315's consumption of nicotine has no apparent effect on its abilities or behavior.
