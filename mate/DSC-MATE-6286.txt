Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6286 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with basic amenities, including a bed, a bookshelf, and appropriate storage facilities. All access to and from SCP-6286’s chamber require clearance from Level 2 or higher personnel. In the event of an unanticipated containment breach, all personnel are advised to avoid physical contact with SCP-6286, and instead notify a senior Foundation agent immediately.

Description: SCP-6286 is a male rabbit of Leporidae family. It stands approximately 5 feet tall when fully upright, while weighing around 45 pounds. SCP-6286’s eyes are blue clown eyes, and distinctively wears a Doge hat on its head. Its forehead features a two-color band, while wearing a jade earring on each ear. SCP-6286 can often be seen wearing a silver chain and a gas mask.

SCP-6286's personality is characterized by its tendency to display high levels of emotional attachment towards both animate and inanimate objects. SCP-6286’s nurturing and caring nature is often seen towards inanimate objects, leading to instances of anthropomorphization.

SCP-6286 has served as a legal consultant to the Foundation for the past three years, and his legal counsel had been proven invaluable in several high-profile trials.

Addendum: Following comprehensive evaluation by Foundation psychiatrists, it was determined that SCP-6286 could serve the Foundation's legal department as a full-time lawyer. Any observation of SCP-6286 outside of its containment chamber must be performed in the presence of a handler with Level 3 clearance or higher.
