SCP-4989 is a humanoid tiger, standing at 6 feet tall with a lean yet muscular build. His vibrant green hair is styled into a messy yet fashionable fauxhawk and is often seen wearing a purple cap with two colored bands around his forehead. SCP-4989 is typically found sporting a pair of thick-framed nerd glasses, giving him an academic appearance.

One noticeable feature of SCP-4989 is his jade earring that he wears on his right ear, shining brightly in the sunlight. Often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck and a normal gas mask over his mouth, it is unknown if or why he requires the gas mask, but it does not seem to cause any harm.

SCP-4989â€™s personality is notably nurturing and caring, demonstrating a great deal of emotional intelligence and empathy. He has a strong tendency to act paternal towards his friends and family, even going so far as to treat them like his own children. SCP-4989 is always willing to lend a helping hand and will often go out of his way to ensure the wellbeing of those around him.

Due to his kind nature, SCP-4989 is often the source of comedic relief in his interactions with those around him, especially when attempting to care for others. Despite this, he is capable of being quite serious and assertive when needed, displaying a sense of responsibility that one would expect from a train driver.
