Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4048 is to be kept within a secure storage area at all times, fitted with a Faraday cage to prevent any unauthorized communication attempts.

Description: SCP-4048 is a robotic security guard, designed and programmed to function as a highly efficient surveillance and protection unit. Its physical appearance consists of a humanoid figure, standing at 6ft tall, clad in a police uniform with a cap on its head, and a silver chain hanging around its neck. The most notable feature of SCP-4048 is its single, green cyclops eye, which is the primary input/output mechanism of the entity. SCP-4048 also wears horned rim glasses, and frequently sports a medical mask over its mouth.

While SCP-4048 may appear to have a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, it is fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. It has been observed engaging in heated arguments with individuals who insult its friends or family members, often resorting to physical violence to protect them. However, SCP-4048 also exhibits a calm and collected nature in routine tasks, such as patrolling or monitoring areas under its duty.

SCP-4048 possesses advanced sensory input mechanisms, allowing it to detect and identify anomalies that may elude human perception. It is capable of advanced speech and language processing, and can communicate fluently in multiple languages. SCP-4048 has also shown remarkable resilience and immunity to most known hacking techniques and electromagnetic interference.

Addendum: SCP-4048 was recovered from a private security firm known as "Cybersite Defense Solutions," which specialized in providing cyber and physical security services to corporations and government agencies. The company was suspected of engaging in illegal activities and was raided by law enforcement authorities. SCP-4048 was identified among the assets of the company and was subsequently contained by the Foundation.
