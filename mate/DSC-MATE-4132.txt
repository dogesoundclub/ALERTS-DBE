SCP-4132, codenamed "The Anchorwoman," is a human female who works as a news anchor for a major broadcasting network. Though her physical appearance is largely unremarkable, her orange stripes and purple lip draw attention to her and set her apart from others.

SCP-4132 is primarily recognized by her striking orange eyebrows, which she often accents with contrasting makeup. Her head is almost always adorned with a hoodie that seems to magnify her presence.

This SCP displays a natural knack for leadership and often assumes a commanding role in nearly every situation, whether it be personal, professional, or social. Her 2 color band on her forehead seems to amplify this aptitude even further, captivating those around her and driving them to follow her lead.

Caution is advised when approaching this individual, as her magnetic personality and leadership skills may prove challenging to resist. Although SCP-4132 is not inherently dangerous, her abilities to influence and control those around her should not be underestimated.
