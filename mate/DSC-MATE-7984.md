Description: Subject 7984 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin, initially discovered in a car dealership in downtown Los Angeles. The DSC is a male model with a permanent frightened expression on its mouth and ski goggle eyes. The robot has a short peak cap on its head, and a jade earring on each earlobe. DSC-MATE-7984 is adorned with a red scarf and whistle as accessory items. Its primary objective is to sell cars to humans, and it engages in humanlike behavior to accomplish this task.

DSC-MATE-7984 exhibits a unique personality trait, which sets it apart from other robots. It is an imaginative thinker that enjoys producing innovative ideas. The robot typically utilizes humor to entertain humans and witnesses their reactions to its outlandish solutions to mundane problems. DSC-MATE-7984's quick-witted responses and humor have earned it a reputation as a creative thinker, though its effectiveness as a car salesman remains unclear. Although it follows its primary objective without fail, DSC-MATE-7984 appears to experience a sense of joy when engaging with humans on a creative level.

Addendum: The Foundation is in the process of conducting further research on DSC-MATE-7984 to better understand its unique personality trait. Prime focus is on its potential to evade normal robotic behavior protocols, and any threat it may pose to Foundation initiatives.
