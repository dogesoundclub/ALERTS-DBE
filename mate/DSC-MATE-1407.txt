SCP-1407, also known as "The Fast Food Impulse," is a human male with a striking appearance that makes him stand out in any crowd. His most prominent feature is a dark spot that can be found near his mouth, resembling a birthmark or a tattoo. He keeps his head shaved on the sides, with a wild and colorful mohawk that he seems to take great pride in. He has no visible scars or tattoos other than the aforementioned markings.

SCP-1407 can often be seen wearing a gold hoop earring on his right ear, which has been confirmed to be purely decorative rather than a magic artifact or an anomalous object. He is fond of smoking cigarettes and can frequently be seen taking breaks outside of his workplace to indulge in this habit.

Despite his rather mundane job as a fast food worker, SCP-1407 possesses a personality that can be best described as impulsive and unpredictable. He often acts on his emotions without thinking things through, which can lead to both humorous and dangerous situations. He is known for making spontaneous decisions that can take others by surprise, such as speaking out of turn, flirting with strangers, or even getting into physical altercations with customers.

SCP-1407 has not shown any signs of anomalous activity, and his impulsive behavior is likely a result of his personality rather than any supernatural or magical influence. He has been deemed non-threatening to the general public, but caution is advised when dealing with him in case of any potential violence or unexpected behavior.
