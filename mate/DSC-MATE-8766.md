Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8766 is to be kept in a secure storage facility under lock and key when not in use.

Description: DSC-MATE-8766 is a male Traffic Officer robot standing at 5'10" tall. DSC-MATE-8766's face features a frightened mouth expression and wears horn-rimmed glasses over its sensors. DSC-MATE-8766's head resembles a red alarm, and they have red cross earrings as well as a gold chain and whistle as accessories.

DSC-MATE-8766's programming is designed to be highly observant and attentive to details, which makes them an excellent informant and traffic enforcer. Despite being a machine, DSC-MATE-8766 has a neurosis towards gift-giving and often spends an excessive amount of time, analyzing and selecting the "perfect" present instead of its programmed tasks. They have been known to initiate traffic stops only to present drivers with hastily wrapped gifts or cards. Their behavior in this regard is currently under investigation by the Foundation's behavioral experts.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8766 expressed a desire to celebrate Christmas in the Foundation's recent annual survey of its staff. Their compliance with activation instructions has otherwise been unremarkable. If they continue to exhibit behavior movements toward the celebration of events and occasions, Foundation personnel will provide decorations and appropriate programming updates.
