SCP-2944 is a peculiar specimen, even amongst the ranks of our already peculiar clientele. The entity, which takes the form of a bengal tiger, has been observed to exhibit a curious fascination with the inner mechanisms of human society - particularly that of politics. Though its motives are unclear, SCP-2944 has climbed the ranks of local government and currently operates as a politician in the undisclosed region of [REDACTED].

While superficially similar to other tigers in appearance, SCP-2944 boasts a set of interests far exceeding others of its kind. The subject is often seen donning a red beanie, and nerd glasses sit atop its elongated snout in a curious fashion. Further inspection reveals SCP-2944 to wear a gilded earring on the right ear, and, when operating in its political capacity or in situations requiring anonymity, a red scarf is often worn.

But perhaps the most notable feature of SCP-2944 is its LED gas mask, which, in conjunction with its intimidating organic form, establishes its powerful presence in any given space. The mask, according to our records, has a variety of functions and uses. While we are still in the process of determining the exact purpose of said mask, we observe that it may serve as a form of communication, or as a signal for dangerous situations. The distinctive red lights fitted on its surface certainly serve to catch the eye.

Despite its esteemed position, SCP-2944 has been observed to be occasionally forgetful and quick to distraction. While this seems to be a weakness at first glance, it can provide the subject with a wide range of possibilities in social encounters. As such, great care must be taken when engaging with this entity - humorous situations aside, SCP-2944 has proven to be a powerful force in the political arena, and one certainly not to be underestimated.
