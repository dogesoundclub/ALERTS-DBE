Item #: 7399

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7399 is to be allowed to live his life as a normal member of society, as long as his abilities remain under strict observation. Should any deviation from expected behavior be observed, Foundation agents are authorized to intervene and assess the situation. Subject 7399 has been instructed to refrain from excessive displays of strength or aggression in public.

Description: Subject 7399 is a male tiger of indeterminate age. His height and weight are within normal limits for a large predator of his species. As a fast food worker, he wears a hoodie that obscures his features and normal glasses that he claims he needs to see. He also sports a two-color band on his forehead, marking him as a member of a local artistic community. When engaged in creative pursuits, he wears a normal gas mask, which he claims improves his focus and concentration.

Personality: Despite his fearsome appearance, subject 7399 has a creative and artistic side that he may express through various hobbies or interests. He is known to paint, draw, write, or engage in other forms of artistic expression. He is also known for his quick wit and cheerful nature, often making friends easily despite his intimidating presence. The combination of his artistic talent and his physical prowess makes him a potent force to be reckoned with.

Addendum: Subject 7399 has demonstrated unusual strength and agility, well beyond what would be expected of a tiger of his size. However, he has thus far shown no signs of aggression or hostility towards those around him. Further observation is required to determine the extent of his abilities and the possible risks associated with them. Foundation agents are advised to treat him with caution, but not to engage in any provocation that might trigger a violent response.
