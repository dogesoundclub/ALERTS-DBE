SCP-2326 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a comfortable bed, a desk, and a small bookshelf. SCP-2326 is to be allowed access to a library of books within its containment, and may request additional materials from the Foundation's archives with approval from Level 3 personnel or higher.

SCP-2326 may be allowed to continue its employment as a banker, but is to be monitored during any financial transactions to prevent any misuse of funds or Foundation assets. SCP-2326 is not to be allowed access to any sensitive financial information or banking records.

Description:

SCP-2326 is a male rabbit standing at 1 meter in height. Its eyes are replaced with VR rainbow LED, and it sports a single jade earring on its left ear. It wears a silver chain around its neck, which is believed to be purely ornamental.

SCP-2326 displays a thirst for knowledge and is known to spend a significant amount of time reading and researching obscure topics. It has a collection of books and documentaries within its containment, and displays passion in sharing its newfound knowledge with others.

Despite its ability to communicate fluently in English, SCP-2326 often speaks in technical terms and jargon related to financial and banking systems. Its employment as a banker allows it to stay up to date with the latest financial trends and technology.

SCP-2326 has displayed no unusual abilities beyond its knowledge and passion for banking and finance. However, due to its unique appearance and abilities, precautions should be taken when interacting with SCP-2326 to prevent any mishaps or misunderstandings.

Addendum:

SCP-2326 has requested access to the Foundation's financial records and has expressed great interest in learning about how the Foundation manages its budget. Approval for this request is pending review by Foundation higher-ups.
