Item #: SCP-344

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-344 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-███. Access to SCP-344's cell requires level 2 security clearance and must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel. Any interaction with SCP-344 must be conducted through a video communication system, keeping visual contact with SCP-344 to a minimum.

Description: SCP-344 is a human female believed to be in her late 20s to early 30s, standing at 171 cm tall and weighing approximately 54 kg. SCP-344's most notable facial features are the spots on her cheeks and the purple color of her lips. SCP-344 has blonde hair often seen wearing an ushanka, with a green cross earring on her left ear.

SCP-344's accessories consist of a silver chain around her neck and an LED gas mask, which SCP-344 wears for extended periods of time. SCP-344 is known to have a natural talent for leadership and often becomes the center of attention in various social situations. SCP-344's dominant personality traits make SCP-344 a valuable asset in the field of law enforcement.

SCP-344 was discovered working as a traffic officer in the city of [REDACTED], where SCP-344 was observed displaying extraordinary leadership skills and strategic thinking. SCP-344's presence in any given situation draws attention and commands respect; however, SCP-344's unusual behavior and appearance make SCP-344 easily identifiable, which has in turn posed security risks.

SCP-344's abilities are believed to be the result of an unknown anomaly, and as such, research into the nature of SCP-344's unique abilities and appearance is ongoing.

Addendum: 

Behavioral Assessment: SCP-344 displays a high level of confidence in all situations and has an excellent track record in tasks related to law enforcement. SCP-344's strong leadership skills are a potential asset to the Foundation, and as such, further testing is recommended to determine the extent of SCP-344's abilities. SCP-344's attachment to the gas mask and jewelry must also be further examined.
