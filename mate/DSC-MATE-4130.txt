Item #: SCP-4130

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4130 is to be monitored at all times via video surveillance to ensure compliance with Foundation regulations. Due to their occupation as a police officer, SCP-4130 is granted limited access to sensitive facilities and information. However, their use of Foundation resources must be closely monitored and approved by their superiors.

SCP-4130's idealistic tendencies must also be consistently addressed to prevent the possibility of compromising Foundation operations. Psychological evaluations are to be conducted regularly to ensure SCP-4130 remains mentally stable and compliant.

Description: SCP-4130 appears to be a human female in her late 20s or early 30s. They stand at approximately 5'7 and weigh approximately 140 pounds. Noteworthy facial features include spotted skin and ruby-red lips. Their eyes are a unique shade of virtual-reality jade, which emit a soft glow under particular lighting conditions.

SCP-4130's hair is styled into two pigtails, which are occasionally adorned with small, decorative clips. A pair of goggles is typically worn on their forehead, and a green cross earring is worn in their left ear. SCP-4130 also wears a gold chain necklace and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-4130 is a police officer with a strong desire to make the world a better place. They often participate in peaceful protests and boycotts if they believe a cause goes against their values. Despite their noble intentions, SCP-4130's actions have the potential to compromise Foundation operations, and monitoring is required to prevent such occurrences.

Addendum: SCP-4130 has shown remarkable dedication to their duties as a police officer, often going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure public safety. However, their idealistic tendencies must be kept in check to prevent interference with Foundation protocols.
