Description: SCP-361 is a male human, identified as a programmer by profession. Their most prominent anomalous feature is the presence of orange stripes on their face.

Two accessories found on SCP-361 are a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-361's personality displays a strong value for tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude towards their work.

SCP-361 is known to enjoy telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through their family or community.

SCP-361 is not known to display any aggressive behavior unless provoked. However, the Foundation warns personnel against underestimating this entity's potential threat, as its playful nature may mask the full extent of its abilities.
