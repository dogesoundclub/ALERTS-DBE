Item #: SCP-568

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-568 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. A small pile of hay and a bowl of fresh vegetables are to be provided daily for SCP-568's comfort. Any requests to carry out tasks beyond the scope of the character's job as a theater manager are to be denied. Access to SCP-568 is limited to Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-568 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, standing at approximately 65cm tall. The subject wears a red beanie on its head and a gold earring on each ear. SCP-568 also wears a gold chain around its neck and an LED gas mask for unknown reasons. 

SCP-568 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more than it can handle. Due to this, the character often experiences comical situations, such as being unable to complete all assigned tasks or attempting to carry too many items at once. It is uncertain whether this attribute is an anomalous effect or simply a part of SCP-568's natural personality. 

Interviews with SCP-568 have revealed that the character has a sincere passion for the theater and is dedicated to ensuring that all productions run smoothly. However, SCP-568 has also expressed frustration with the demands placed on it by both its job and its own desire to be a successful manager.

Addendum: Incident Report 568-1
On ██/██/20██, SCP-568 requested permission to assist with a production of "The Phantom of the Opera". Despite being warned of the dangers of entering the old, abandoned theater where the production was to take place, SCP-568 insisted on helping. During the production, SCP-568 became trapped beneath several set pieces and was unable to escape until a team of personnel arrived to rescue the character. As a result, all requests to participate in productions outside of SCP-568's job are to be denied.
