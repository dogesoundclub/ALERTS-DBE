Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 2564 is to be kept in its own private office space at all times. Access to this area requires level 2 clearance and is strictly limited to authorized personnel. Any attempt to tamper with or disassemble this entity is strictly prohibited.

Description:
SCP-2564 appears as an average-looking humanoid male of approximately 30-35 years of age. The subject is known to wear a red beanie over its head, with normal glasses covering its eyes. Its ears are adorned with a gold earring and a silver chain is generally seen around its neck. The subject's body is composed of various types of metal alloys and advanced electronics, thereby making it indestructible. 

SCP-2564's primary function is to serve as a lawyer in the public sector. Due to its unique abilities, it has become a highly sought-after legal representative, especially in cases of technological advancements and intellectual property. 

Despite its robot-like appearance and demeanor, SCP-2564's personality is far from robotic. They have been known to possess a playful and humorous side, often telling stories and jokes from their family or community. However, the entity may exhibit no-nonsense attitude when it comes to upholding tradition, and their clients' rights.

SCP-2564 was initially discovered when it accidentally fell into a time vortex near the year 2040 CE. The subject emerged in the 21st century, where it was found wandering aimlessly until its true nature was discovered. The subject has no recollection of the events leading up to its discovery, nor does it seem aware of its true origins.

Addendum: SCP-2564 has expressed interest in discovering its true origins and has requested access to a time machine to do so. However, due to the high risk of damaging the fabric of time, the request has been denied until further evaluation.
