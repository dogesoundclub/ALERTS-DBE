Description: Item 8638 is a human female, approximately 5'5" in height, with distinct spots on her cheeks and a purple lip. She wears normal glasses over her brown eyes and a purple cap with a headset attached to her head. A two-color band rests on her forehead, and she has green cross earrings on her ears.

Despite her appearance, Item 8638's most notable feature is her personality. She possesses a strong and decisive personality, often exhibiting tendencies of being bossy or intimidating. However, her actions are solely driven by her desire for efficiency and effectiveness in getting things done. This personality trait has made her quite an asset in the medical ward, where quick decisions can often mean the difference between life and death.
