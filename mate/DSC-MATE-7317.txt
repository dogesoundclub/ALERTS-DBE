Item #: 7317

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7317 is to be allowed to roam freely within the urban environment. Monitoring devices are to be placed on all delivery vehicles that the subject operates. In the event that the subject becomes hostile or shows signs of deviation from its usual routine, Foundation personnel are to be summoned immediately. Any artifacts delivered by the subject must be inspected for anomalous properties before being allowed into Foundation custody.

Description: Subject 7317 appears to be a male human, equipped with a peculiar set of features that distinguish it from other humans. The most notable feature is the "Mouth Spot"; a black discoloration on the left-hand side of the subject's mouth, which gives the impression that he has been smudged with ink.

Subject 7317 also sports a pair of "Nerd Glasses" which hold magnifying lenses, granting the subject enhanced vision. A "Retro Cap" adorns the top of the subject's head, accompanied by a pair of goggles, which are found draped over the subject's forehead. These goggles are purely aesthetic in nature, and may simply serve as a fashion statement.

Two accessories can often be seen resting on the subject, a "Silver Chain," which appears purely decorative, and a "Cigarette." Both items do not appear to pose a threat to the safety of the subject or to others.

Personality: Despite its peculiarities, Subject 7317 appears to be a social person, in tune with his surroundings. When not delivering packages, the subject spends its free time engaging in a multitude of artistic hobbies, including painting, drawing, and writing. It is notable that the subject can often be seen carrying a notebook, used to jot down ideas and inspirations as they come to the subject's mind.

Subject 7317 displays no signs of aggression towards any Foundation personnel, and appears to be a model citizen. However, the Foundation advises caution, since the subject's anomalous features may not be exhaustive, and remain actively under investigation.

Addendum 7317-01: On rare occasions, the subject has been observed manipulating the contents of the deliveries entrusted to it. These alterations appear to be minor and aim to improve the delivery experience for the recipients. The Foundation has currently deemed this action to be within acceptable parameters, and the subject is allowed future flexibility in this regard.
