SCP-3650, also known as "The Jester Programmer," is a human male who works as a computer programmer in a corporate office environment. His distinguishing features include numerous spots on his face, a cheerful smile, and nerd glasses covering his eyes. He often adorns a blue bandana on his head and a unique green cross earring on his left ear. SCP-3650 tends to hold a cigarette in his hand, regardless of the non-smoking policy in the office.

SCP-3650's infectious sense of humor is legendary among his co-workers. He delights in cracking jokes and making others laugh, frequently using his comedic talents to ease tension and discomfort within the workplace. Though some may underestimate him due to his playful nature, SCP-3650 is highly intelligent and resourceful, excelling in his work despite his unorthodox approach.

SCP-3650's levity and charm are linked to his anomalous properties, which imbue him with the ability to generate laughter and positive emotions in those within his vicinity. This attribute can also cause unexpected and hazardous phenomena, including laughter-induced seizures, spontaneous combustion, and sudden mood swings. Due to the unpredictability of his anomalous abilities, SCP-3650 has been classified as a Euclid class anomaly and must be closely monitored at all times.

Handle with caution around SCP-3650. His humorous antics may be amusing, but his anomalous powers remain a significant threat to containment.
