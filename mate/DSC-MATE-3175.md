Item #: DSC-MATE-3175

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3175 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Interaction with DSC-MATE-3175 is to be kept to a minimum, as their tendency to fix things in unconventional ways may pose a security risk. Any repair work or maintenance needed in DSC-MATE-3175's containment chamber must be performed by personnel under strict supervision.

Description: DSC-MATE-3175 is a human male of average height and build. They are a firefighter by profession and are often called to scenes of anomalous activity due to their unique abilities. DSC-MATE-3175's most notable physical features are the orange stripes on their face and their ski goggle eyes. Their head appears to be not arranged green, and they wear a jade earring in one ear. In addition, DSC-MATE-3175 is often seen wearing a red scarf and a gas mask, choosing not to wear the standard Foundation-issued protective gear.

DSC-MATE-3175's personality is described as practical and hands-on. They have a knack for fixing things in unconventional ways, often using duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects or rigging up a makeshift solution to a problem that others would find too complicated. DSC-MATE-3175's ingenuity has proven useful in several containment breaches, but their tendency to improvise can pose a danger if left unchecked.

DSC-MATE-3175 has demonstrated moderate resistance to anomalous effects in the past, likely due to their firefighting training and experience dealing with hazardous materials. However, DSC-MATE-3175's eagerness to help and tendency to take risks may lead to them putting themselves in danger unnecessarily. As such, any requests for DSC-MATE-3175's assistance must be evaluated carefully before approval.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3175 has requested access to the Foundation's anomalous object repair and maintenance facilities, claiming that they can fix the broken objects better than anyone else. This request is currently under review by Site-██'s Ethics Committee.
