Description: SCP-5681 appears to be a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes. The rabbit exhibits green hair in a purple cap as its head, along with an LED gas mask as an accessory. SCP-5681 presents a unique ability to communicate in multiple human languages, particularly in the areas of software programming and computer science.

SCP-5681 has a strong and idealistic personality, with a desire to make the world a better place. However, this can lead to humorous situations, such as protest or boycotting of various causes that violate SCP-5681's personal values. SCP-5681 has demonstrated a high level of intelligence and often engages in intense programming sessions, resulting in multiple successful projects.

Addendum: Incident 5681-A
During a routine interaction with SCP-5681, the rabbit expressed significant distress regarding the use of technology in the creation of weapons and weaponry. SCP-5681 refused to participate in any programming that would result in the production of weapons, prompting a brief standoff with the security team before reasoning with the rabbit. Further education on the role of technology in modern warfare is recommended as a means of avoiding possible future scenarios.
