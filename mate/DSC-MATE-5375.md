Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5375 is to be confined to a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with a small workstation running an operating system compatible with its programming skills. The LED gas mask attached to DSC-MATE-5375 must be maintained and monitored regularly. No personnel are allowed to enter DSC-MATE-5375's cell unless authorized by Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-5375 is a male monkey humanoid measuring approximately 1.2 meters in height. Its face features a frightened mouth and it has a parted pink head with jade earrings. DSC-MATE-5375 wears an LED gas mask as an accessory continuously, which is believed to enhance its programming abilities.

DSC-MATE-5375 displays a love for adventure and enjoys taking risks or trying new things, which has brought it to the attention of the Foundation. DSC-MATE-5375 has a tendency to engage in activities such as bungee jumping and exploring wilderness despite the associated risks.

Despite its animalistic traits, DSC-MATE-5375's programming skills surpass those of most human programmers. DSC-MATE-5375 is capable of creating computer programs that perform several functions and has been observed engaging in vocal communications using standard programming jargon.

DSC-MATE-5375's origins are unknown as no records have been found in regards to its capture or creation. Its abilities and unique combination of monkey and human traits make it a valuable subject for further testing.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5375 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel since its capture and confinement. However, its love for adventure and risk-taking behavior should be carefully monitored to ensure the safety of both DSC-MATE-5375 itself and our personnel.
