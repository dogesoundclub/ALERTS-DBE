Item #: SCP-1198

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1198 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Outside of his work with the police department, SCP-1198 is not permitted to leave the containment area without express permission from at least two Level-2 personnel.

Description: SCP-1198 appears to be a human male in his late twenties, with a distinct mohawk haircut and a gold earring in his left ear. His eyes are covered by normal glasses, and he is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck. Additionally, SCP-1198 is frequently seen with a candy stick in his mouth.

SCP-1198 is a police officer with a keen attention to detail, often bordering on obsessive behavior. While this trait is generally harmless, it has been known to manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing his spice rack or color-coding his closet.

When interacting with other individuals, SCP-1198 presents as friendly and approachable, with a notable smile constantly on his face. However, he has been known to become overwhelmed when confronted with particularly chaotic or cluttered environments.

SCP-1198’s behavior is under constant observation and study. While there have been no known instances of anomalous activity, his unique personality traits and peculiar behaviors warrant continued assessment by Foundation personnel.
