Description: Subject 4709 is a tiger, male, native to the Indian subcontinent. Despite its imposing form, the creature appears to be emotionally weak, prone to tears and overwhelmed by sentimentality. 4709's most salient feature is its perpetually frightened mouth - a phenomenon researchers attribute to chronic anxiety and stress.

Researchers have observed the tiger engaging in activities such as listening to music, watching movies or art that elicits strong feelings. Subject 4709 seems to have a particular fondness for slow, melodic tunes and intimate performances.

Final Note: Given the creature's vulnerability, extreme caution should be advised when interacting with Subject 4709. Any attempts at forced emotion or provocation may result in severe consequences.
