Item #: SCP-1143

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1143 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with furnishings and amenities suitable for human habitation. Access to any form of technology beyond that needed for maintenance of the chamber is strictly prohibited unless authorized by Level 4 clearance.

SCP-1143 is allowed to bring any inanimate objects into their chamber, which must be inspected thoroughly by security personnel.

Description: SCP-1143 is a female human of indeterminate age, standing at 1.78 meters tall with a weight of approximately 72 kg. SCP-1143's most distinguishing features are the spots on her face, and her red lips. Additionally, SCP-1143 has blue clown eyes, which are assumed to be colored contact lenses, and has a purple cap with a headset, as well as a red cross earring.

SCP-1143 is a skilled mechanic and is extremely affectionate towards inanimate objects. They frequently anthropomorphize their possessions, and often assign names or personalities to them. SCP-1143 cares for objects in their possession, no matter how inconsequential, as they would a living creature. They often converse with their possessions, expressing concern for their wellbeing and occasionally apologizing if they feel as if they have slighted them in some way.

It's unclear when SCP-1143 began to exhibit this behavior. The Foundation first became aware of them when a containment breach was caused by SCP-1143's attachment to an anomalous machine. It is presently believed that SCP-1143's anomalies may stem from a childhood trauma or psychological disorder.

SCP-1143 is cooperative with Foundation personnel but tends to become agitated if their possessions are threatened or taken away.

Addendum: SCP-1143's habit of anthropomorphizing inanimate objects may be useful in containing certain SCPs. Further testing is required.
