Item #: 8125

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 8125 is to be kept in a secure storage unit at Site-██. Access to 8125 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher and must be accompanied by at least one armed guard at all times. Testing on 8125 must be authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel and conducted with caution.

Description: 8125 is a male robot designed to operate as a firefighter. Its body is approximately 6 feet tall and covered in a red and silver metallic casing. Its face is equipped with a single green cyclops eye and a mouth that is constantly in a state of fear. The eyes appear to be ski goggles and the head is adorned with a red beanie.

8125 is highly detail-oriented and can become obsessive over the most insignificant details. It has been observed alphabetizing its spice rack and color-coding its closet with extreme precision. Despite its peculiar behavior, 8125 displays no signs of malfunction and continues to function normally as a firefighter.

Addendum: Experimentation on 8125 has revealed that it is immune to heat and high temperatures, making it an excellent asset for emergency situations involving fire. However, its obsessive tendencies can lead to delayed response times during rescue operations. It is recommended that 8125 receive regular maintenance to prevent any malfunction or deviation from standard operation.
