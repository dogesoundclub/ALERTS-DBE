Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2954 is to be monitored at all times by security personnel, with all interactions to be recorded and reviewed by the designated research team. DSC-MATE-2954's movements are to be tracked via GPS and any deviations from its delivery route are to be reported immediately. Personnel are not to make physical contact with DSC-MATE-2954 without proper protective gear.

Description: DSC-MATE-2954 is a human male identified as a delivery driver. They are easily identifiable by their red beanie and gold earring. However, DSC-MATE-2954's most striking feature is their LED gas mask, which they are never seen without.

DSC-MATE-2954's red clown eyes appear to be a permanent feature, and the scared expression on their mouth suggests a constant state of fear. Despite this, DSC-MATE-2954 displays a strong sense of independence and self-reliance, frequently refusing assistance even when it would be beneficial to them.

In situations where DSC-MATE-2954 is lost, they will stubbornly refuse to use a map or GPS, leading to comical scenarios where they become hopelessly disoriented. Additionally, DSC-MATE-2954 will often attempt to move heavy objects by themselves - likely influenced by their strong independent streak.

Personnel are advised to interact with DSC-MATE-2954 cautiously, as their reluctance to ask for help may lead to dangerous situations. As DSC-MATE-2954's gas mask appears to be a permanent accessory, researchers are investigating the possibility of it being a physical manifestation of DSC-MATE-2954's fears or anxieties.
