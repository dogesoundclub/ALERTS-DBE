Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6349 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a desk and chair. Access to any and all writing implements must be strictly supervised to prevent any unauthorized attempts at escape.

Description: SCP-6349 is a male monkey of the species Macaca nigra, measuring approximately 1 meter in height and weighing 25 kg. SCP-6349's most distinguishing features are the horned rim glasses which it wears over its small black eyes and the doge hat it constantly dons upon its head. SCP-6349 further accessorizes with a red scarf and candy stick.

SCP-6349 has a jovial and friendly personality, but can be quite forgetful and scattered, often losing track of time and appointments or leaving important documents behind. SCP-6349 appears to be a skilled car salesman, frequently charming potential buyers with its playful antics and good-natured humor. SCP-6349 is also notably fond of bananas, often incorporating them in its sales pitch.

Addendum: SCP-6349 displays a remarkable talent for adapting to new situations and learning quickly, although it remains uncertain how a monkey of its kind managed to acquire such skills. Further research is required to ascertain the extent of SCP-6349's abilities and its true nature.
