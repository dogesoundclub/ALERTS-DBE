Item #: SCP-5004

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5004 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Access to SCP-5004 must be approved by Level 2 personnel or higher. Standard security protocols apply.

Description: SCP-5004 is a male humanoid, identified as John Doe. He is a lawyer by profession and shows no signs of anomalous activity outside of his facial features, clothing, and accessories.

SCP-5004 has spots on his face, and an unusual smile that appears to be permanently affixed to his face. He also has unusual red clown eyes, which seem to be part of his basic physical makeup. His head bears a police cap that he tends to wear most of the time.

On his forehead, SCP-5004 has a two-color band, which may have some symbolic significance, although research into this topic has been limited. He also sports a gold earring on each ear, which some suggest may be an indication of higher social status.

SCP-5004 wears a red scarf as his primary accessory, which may help to cover up his unusual facial features. He also carries a normal gas mask with him, which may be related to some unusual ritualistic behavior he exhibits.

SCP-5004 has a strong idealistic personality and often takes a stance against situations that he perceives as going against his values. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting companies or causes that he feels are inappropriate.

Addendum: It is recommended that further research be conducted into SCP-5004's anomalous properties to better understand the origins of his unusual features and accessories.
