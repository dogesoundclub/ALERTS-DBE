SCP-3604 is a Real Estate Agent classified as a Human entity, although their appearance may suggest otherwise. The subject has a distinctly witch-like appearance, sporting a short, unkempt hairstyle and a pair of goggles perched on their forehead, highlighting their two-tone forehead band. 

Perhaps the most striking feature of SCP-3604 is their purple lips, which contrast vividly with their red clown eyes, reminiscent of a harlequin. The subject is also known to wear a red cross earring and adorn themselves with gold chains, which they may use to project an air of eccentricity and artistry.

Despite their profession in real estate, SCP-3604's true passion lies in their hobbies, which can be as strange as they are creative. They have been observed collecting an array of oddities, indulging in cosplay, and writing dark poetry. Their vivid imagination and attention to detail often make their works stand out and stand apart from those of mundane individuals.

SCP-3604's hobbies and interests may not only make them a unique individual, but their collection may prove valuable to those with an eye for rare and unusual items. Caution should be exercised with such individuals, as their motivations may not always align with standard business practices. Trusting them without proper context or clearance may lead to unpredictable results.
