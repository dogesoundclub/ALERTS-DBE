Item #: SCP-5400

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5400 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with personal belongings and allowed to continue their occupation as a fashion designer. SCP-5400 is not permitted to leave containment without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-5400 is a human female in her mid-30s with distinctive face features, including orange stripes on her cheeks and red lips. She has been observed to have an obsession with rainbow-colored clothing and accessories, often wearing a vibrant headpiece and gold earrings as well as a choker.

SCP-5400 has a charismatic personality and a love for adventure, often taking risks and trying new things. Their personal stories involve near-death experiences while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness due to their adventurous nature.

SCP-5400's anomalous effect allows them to create fashion designs that, when worn by individuals, alter the way they perceive their environment. This can lead to the wearers experiencing a heightened sense of adventure, leading to them taking increased risks.

SCP-5400 has thus far demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel, and as such, they have been allowed to continue their fashion designing career within containment.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred when SCP-5400 convinced a guard to assist them in a daring escape attempt. Foundation personnel were able to recapture SCP-5400 after a four-day search, after which additional safety precautionary measures were instated.
