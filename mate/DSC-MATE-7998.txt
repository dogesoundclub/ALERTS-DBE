Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7998 is to be allowed freedom of movement within the city limits, provided that it reports for duty on time and completes all deliveries in a timely and efficient manner. Any deviation from this behavior must be reported immediately to the SCP Foundation.

Description: SCP-7998 is a human male of average height and weight. Its most distinctive feature is a pair of ski goggles serving as its eyes. SCP-7998 wears a short-peak cap on its head, with a gold earring on each ear. It is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7998 works as a delivery driver and takes its duties very seriously. However, it also knows how to have fun and enjoys entertaining others with its dance moves and silly antics. This can cause confusion or alarm among those unaccustomed to its behavior, leading to SCP-7998's designation as an anomalous object.

SCP-7998 demonstrates a strong sense of duty and responsibility in its work, ensuring that packages are delivered promptly and efficiently. It has demonstrated an adaptable skill set and can navigate through various terrains, including pedestrian zones and busy roads. It has not demonstrated any unusual abilities; the anomalous aspect of SCP-7998 lies entirely in its unusual appearance and behavior.

Addendum: SCP-7998's behavior has been monitored for six months, and no malevolent or dangerous activity has been observed. Research into the origin of SCP-7998 is ongoing. In the meantime, SCP-7998 is to be monitored for any potential changes in behavior or abilities.
