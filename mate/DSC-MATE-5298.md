Item #: 5298

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5298 is to be detained in chamber 17a at all times, which is a 5x5x5 meter room. The chamber must be emptied of all metal objects and coated in a non-reflective material to deter Subject 5298 from using their abilities to manipulate reflections. All personnel assigned to the observation and interaction with Subject 5298 must wear non-reflective clothing, and reflective surfaces are strictly forbidden within the chamber. Any attempts by Subject 5298 to remove their restraints must be met with non-lethal force to ensure continued containment.

Description:

Subject 5298, also known as 'The Car Salesman', is a human female with striking facial features. They possess distinct orange stripes across their face with bright red lips, clown-like blue eyes, and a 00s school girl hairstyle. Their forehead features a goggle on their forehead whilst also possessing unique green cross earrings and a silver chain.

The subject's abilities are based around the manipulation of reflected surfaces. Personnel have reported experiencing discomfort and migraines when subjected to the abilities of the subject, and all interactions or observations must be done through the provision of cameras, monitors, or on-site observation.

Subject 5298 is relatively compliant and has demonstrated a rather dry sense of humor that can catch people unaware. Despite their reserved behavior, they have a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that often produce laughter from those around them.

It is critical to maintain containment of this subject due to the unpredictable nature of their abilities. All attempts must be made to prevent them from using reflective surfaces to create an escape, and as such, their detention chamber must be free of metal and highly secure.

Notes:

In observation logs, Subject 5298 appears to possess strong salesmanship skills, with many researchers reporting feeling the urge to make impulsive purchases during conversations. As such, interactions with the subject must be limited and carefully controlled to prevent any undue influence on containment staff.

Research is ongoing to determine the full extent of Subject 5298's abilities and any further characteristics of their personality that may aid in their continued detainment.
