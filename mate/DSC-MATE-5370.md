Item #: DSC-MATE-5370

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5370 is to be monitored via GPS tracking on their delivery vehicle at all times. Foundation agents are to follow DSC-MATE-5370 on their deliveries and ensure that they do not deviate from their route or engage in any suspicious behavior. DSC-MATE-5370 is to be provided with a Foundation-issued communication device for emergency purposes only.

Description: DSC-MATE-5370 is a male human delivery driver with orange stripes on their face and a smile. They wear nerd glasses over their eyes, a purple cap with a headset on their head, a 2 color band on their forehead, goggles on their forehead, a gold earring in their ears, and a medical mask over their mouth. DSC-MATE-5370's impulsiveness is believed to be connected to their anomalous condition.

DSC-MATE-5370's anomalous abilities have not been fully documented, but Foundation agents have observed several incidents where their actions defy conventional physics. These include:

- Moving at high speeds without any apparent cause
- Instantaneously appearing in a new location without any indication of movement
- Putting items through solid objects without damaging them
- Creating fire from their hands and using it to light cigarettes

DSC-MATE-5370's personality can lead to unpredictable situations, but they are considered relatively harmless at this time. They have been cooperative with Foundation agents and have expressed a desire to keep their abilities secret from the general public.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5370 was discovered during a routine investigation into reports of strange activity in the delivery truck sector. Foundation agents intercepted DSC-MATE-5370 after observing several incidents that defied conventional physics. DSC-MATE-5370 was brought in for questioning and subsequently contained. Research into DSC-MATE-5370's abilities is ongoing.
