Item #: DSC-MATE-4415

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4415 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, and is only to be allowed out for supervised fashion design work. Additionally, all clothing designed by DSC-MATE-4415 must undergo rigorous testing for any potential anomalous effects before being approved for public use.

Description: DSC-MATE-4415 appears to be a male Bengal tiger in his mid-20s who has gained the ability to take on a human form. His humanoid form stands at 6'5" tall, and he has an average build with green hair that is unkempt and not arranged. His most notable facial features include his frightened mouth and blue clown eyes.

DSC-MATE-4415 retains his tiger ears and forehead markings, which consist of a 2-colored band at the forehead. In addition, he has a red cross earring in his left ear, and wears a gold chain and candy stick for accessory purposes.

Although DSC-MATE-4415 often keeps to himself, he has a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. He enjoys delivering deadpan jokes, despite not considering himself to be the life of the party. However, these jokes can be surprising in their humor.

On occasion, DSC-MATE-4415 has been observed exhibiting anomalous effects when designing clothing. These effects range from minor alterations such as changes in color, to major shifts such as the sudden appearance of pockets or zippers where none existed before. DSC-MATE-4415's ability to produce these alterations appears to be subconscious, and he is unable to control it at will.

Addendum: It is recommended that DSC-MATE-4415 undergo further testing in order to better understand the nature and limits of his anomalous abilities. Efforts to discover how DSC-MATE-4415 gained his abilities are also underway.
