DSC-MATE-5827, also known as "The Artful Sentry," is a female human security guard stationed within Site-██. Her most noticeable feature is the presence of numerous spots on her face, which have been determined to be a natural occurrence and not a result of any anomalous effects.

Her eyes are an unusual shade of orange, with eyebrows that match in color. DSC-MATE-5827's hairstyle resembles that of a late 90s-early 00s schoolgirl, further adding to her unique appearance. She also wears a distinctive red cross earring in one ear.

What truly sets DSC-MATE-5827 apart, however, is her choice of accessory - an LED gas mask, which she wears constantly while on duty. The mask emits a soft blue glow and has been modified to allow for clear communication despite its soundproof properties.

DSC-MATE-5827 is known for her artistic and creative personality, often expressing herself through various hobbies such as writing, drawing, and painting. It is theorized that this creative streak may have contributed to her ability to think outside the box and react quickly in high-pressure situations, making her an invaluable asset to Site-██'s security team.
