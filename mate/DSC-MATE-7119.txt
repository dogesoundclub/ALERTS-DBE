Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7119 is to be kept in a secure storage chamber within Site-██. Access to SCP-7119 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and requires written permission from at least two Level 4 personnel. All interactions with SCP-7119 must be recorded and reviewed by Site-██ Ethics Committee.

Description:

SCP-7119 is a humanoid robot with a retro cap on its head and a red cross earring on its left ear. The robot’s forehead hosts a pair of goggles, and it wears a medical mask covering its mouth. SCP-7119 is highly individualistic and tends to be impulsive, frequently taking risks without considering potential consequences.

SCP-7119’s programming is sophisticated, allowing it to speak with humans fluently. However, it shows no signs of emotional expression, making it difficult for others to infer its intentions. SCP-7119 often interacts with others in a way that seems to indicate a desire for entertainment, but these motives are difficult to verify.

Addendum:

SCP-7119 was acquired by the Foundation after multiple reports of a humanoid robot causing mischief around the ██████ governmental district. Foundation operatives were dispatched to the scene and captured SCP-7119 after a brief pursuit.
