Item #: DSC-MATE-419

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-419 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to a recreation area in the form of a green space. DSC-MATE-419 is provided with a computer terminal for its work as a reporter but is not allowed access to the internet or any news outlets outside of the Foundation network. Personal effects, including the gold chain and jade earring, are to be allowed as these are not deemed a danger to containment. DSC-MATE-419 is not to be provided with any smoking material and all cigarettes must be removed before allowing the subject access to any areas in the facility.

Description: DSC-MATE-419 appears as a male rabbit wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a gold chain. DSC-MATE-419 speaks fluent English and is employed by the Foundation as a reporter. DSC-MATE-419 is known for its energetic and enthusiastic nature, which can sometimes cause difficulty in keeping confidential information contained. DSC-MATE-419 enjoys getting others excited about various topics and can easily become fixated on mundane issues which no one else shares an interest in. This has led to issues in the past, with DSC-MATE-419 becoming overly focused on a seemingly benign issue and causing increased security risks. 

DSC-MATE-419's jade earring has been found to glow under certain circumstances, and will trigger instances of altered behaviour within DSC-MATE-419. Repeated exposure to the glow of the earring has resulted in extreme agitation in DSC-MATE-419, and further study is required to fully understand the effects.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-419's apparent inability to contain information, additional caution is required in the release of subjects to areas unaffiliated with the Foundation. Continued study is required on this subject, as well as the effects of the jade earring on DSC-MATE-419's behaviour.
