Item #: SCP-1035

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1035 is to be monitored during their shifts at the fast food restaurant they are employed at. No contact with SCP-1035 is to be made outside of these circumstances.

Description: SCP-1035 is a female human with orange stripes down the sides of her face and purple lips. Her eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED screens that show various shapes and colors. Her head is not arranged in a traditional human fashion and instead resembles a plant with leaves sprouting from her head. SCP-1035 is often seen wearing a choker and LED gas mask while at work.

Personality: SCP-1035 possesses a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge in any situation. This includes at work, within social groups, and in her personal life. She displays confidence and charisma, often using these traits to rally those around her to achieve a common goal. It is important to note that due to SCP-1035's anomalous nature, her influence may have effects beyond what would be considered typical for a human of her leadership ability.

Addendum: It is currently unknown how SCP-1035 acquired her anomalous characteristics. Further investigation is needed to determine if any other individuals possess similar abilities or if SCP-1035 is unique.
