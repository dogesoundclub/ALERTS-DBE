Identity Designation: SCP-7552
Designation Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7552 is to be contained within a secure facility at all times, accessible only by Level 2 personnel or higher. The unit is not to be allowed access to the internet, as it may gain access to sensitive information that could potentially compromise the security of the Foundation.

Description: SCP-7552 is a robotic entity resembling that of a humanoid male with a green cyclops eye. Its face features a jade earring and ski goggle-like eyes atop a purple cap with a headset. The unit is visually distinguishable by the silver chain suspended around its neck.

SCP-7552 is capable of independent motion, capable of carrying out a wide array of tasks with relative ease in line with its profession as a reporter. However, the unit has displayed a tendency towards forgetfulness, often getting sidetracked while executing its programming. This absent-mindedness almost always results in detrimental events, which the unit appears unaware of.

When confronted, SCP-7552 is unable to provide a logical explanation for its erratic behaviour, believing it to be random impulses or errors within its programming.

Addendum: Research has shown that SCP-7552's unorthodox behavior may stem from an unknown software glitch, whose cause and effect remain indistinguishable. Testing is currently ongoing to resolve this concern.
