SCP Foundation File #9405: Human Security Guard

Subject 9405, designated as a human security guard, is a female with a striking appearance. Her most notable feature is her VR Jade LED eyes, which flicker and pulse with an otherworldly glow. Her hair is styled in thick pigtails that hang down to her shoulders, making her appear innocent and playful. However, her presence becomes much more ominous when paired with her gold chain and normal gas mask.

Despite her intimidating appearance, subject 9405 is known for her natural charm and charisma. She can quickly flip the switch from creepy and unsettling to warm and inviting, making her the perfect individual to welcome people into a secure environment. Her humor and goofy antics have been known to ease the tension of even the most heated situations.

Researchers have noted that subject 9405's whimsical nature could lead to some disturbing outcomes. Caution must be taken to ensure that her need for attention and validation does not become a danger to herself or others. It is recommended that she is placed in a support role rather than an active security position.

In conclusion, subject 9405 is a fascinating individual with the potential to be an asset to the Foundation. However, she should be closely monitored to prevent any unexpected outcomes from her unpredictable personality.
