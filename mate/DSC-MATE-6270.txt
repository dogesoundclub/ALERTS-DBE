SCP Foundation Description:

Identification number 6270, also known as "The Brainstorming Tiger," is a dangerous villain with an uncanny ability to devise creative ideas and outlandish solutions to problems. This male tiger possesses a frightened mouth, normal glasses for eyes, and a head that's not arranged green. A goggle on his forehead and gold earring on his ears add an intimidating aesthetic to his appearance.

Though he poses a significant threat to society, many researchers have remarked on his undeniable intelligence and cleverness. He takes pleasure in brainstorming and pushing the limits of logical thought, leading to amusing and even comical situations. His twisted sense of humor can make him unpredictable and challenging to contain.

One notable accessory he consistently carries is a whistle, supposedly used to rally his henchmen and accomplices during criminal activities. His villainous reputation and sharp mind make him a dangerous foe for any agent or SCP Foundation personnel to encounter. Extreme caution is advised when attempting to apprehend him.
