SCP-1151, also known as the "Traffic Officer," is a male human with an unusual appearance that immediately catches the eye. The subject's facial features are characterized by a unique and noticeable pattern of spots that cover his face. The subject's eyes are obscured by a pair of Nerd Glasses, which he appears to require for vision correction.

However, what sets SCP-1151 apart from ordinary humans is the strange accouterments that he wears. SCP-1151's head is adorned with an inexplicable metallic purple finish, giving it a bizarre and otherworldly appearance. Additionally, the subject wears a gold earring and a gold chain, both of which appear to have no function other than ornamentation.

The most unusual feature of SCP-1151's attire, however, is the LED gas mask that he wears over his face. The mask emits a dim blue light and seems to serve no practical purpose, being purely decorative. Despite efforts to remove it, SCP-1151 has refused to part with the gas mask, citing its special significance.

Personality-wise, SCP-1151 is a strange and creative individual with a vivid imagination. He has an interest in various hobbies such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. SCP-1151's creativity may be due to his anomalous physiology or simply a result of his unique life experiences.

In conclusion, SCP-1151 is a fascinating and enigmatic subject that requires further study to fully comprehend his anomalous properties. His appearance and personality are unlike any other humans encountered so far, making him a valuable addition to the Foundation's growing catalog of abnormal entities.
