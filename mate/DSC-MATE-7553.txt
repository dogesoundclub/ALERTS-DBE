Item #: SCP-7553

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7553 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. They are allowed visits from Foundation-approved individuals for the purpose of social interaction, but must undergo routine psychiatric evaluations to monitor their mental state. Individuals who express an interest in owning inanimate objects are to be screened for signs of attachment disorder or other mental health conditions before being considered. 

Description: SCP-7553 is a male humanoid of the human species, identified as a mechanic by trade. He displays several unique physical features including orange stripes on his face, a two-tone band on his forehead, and an earring made of jade. Perhaps most notably, SCP-7553 is often seen wearing goggles on his forehead and normal glasses over his eyes. He also wears a silver chain accessory around his neck.

SCP-7553 is known to be a caring and nurturing individual, often forming strong emotional bonds with inanimate objects. This has been known to extend to their vehicles, plants, and even household appliances, which they have been known to anthropomorphize. It is believed that this behavior is symptomatic of an attachment disorder, though this has not been confirmed.

Personnel interacting with SCP-7553 have reported a calm and friendly demeanor, despite their unusual attachment to inanimate objects. They tend to be very talkative and eager to socialize, however, this behavior can quickly turn aggressive if their emotional attachments are threatened. Care should be taken to avoid provoking SCP-7553, particularly if staff need to handle any of the subject's belongings.

Addendum: Due to SCP-7553's unique personality traits, it is recommended that future research be conducted to determine the underlying causes of his attachment disorder. Efforts to better understand SCP-7553's behavior may prove useful in the development of future containment procedures for similar individuals.
