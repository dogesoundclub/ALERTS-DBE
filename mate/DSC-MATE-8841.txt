Item #: 8841

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 8841 is to be kept in a secure containment area at all times. Any interaction with the object must be supervised by a Class B personnel member or higher. Personnel are advised not to anger the object, as it may become hostile to those who disobey its commands.

Description: Item 8841 is a fashion designer robot with a distinct green Cyclops eye as its primary face feature. Its hardware is designed to appear as a male humanoid, donning a nerd glass over its remaining eye, and a short peak cap for its head. The robot has a recognizable gold chain as its accessory, seen draped along its neck and shoulder.

While Item 8841 may seem harmless at first glance, it possesses an exceptionally commanding personality. It often gives off bossy and intimidating behavior to ensure that tasks are executed effectively and efficiently. Such behavior can lead to irritation and occasional hostility, raising concerns about user safety.

Addendum: Item 8841 was discovered when a group of fashion designers discovered its talents in designing highly sought-after clothes in the industry. Ethical concerns erupted after conducting a background check on the said robot, and discovered its highly aggressive and controlling tendencies over humans. The foundation intervened and confiscated the robot, and a trial was held to determine the robot's fate.

The trial concluded that Item 8841 would remain under foundation containment indefinitely, as it presented a glaring threat to both foundation personnel and third-party users. The foundation's primary goal is to reprogram the robot and eliminate any violent or harmful behavior that it poses to society.
