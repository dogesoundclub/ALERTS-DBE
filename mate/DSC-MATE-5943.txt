Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5943 is to be monitored at all times within its farm habitat. Any breaches or escape attempts must be reported immediately to Site Command. Personnel are strictly forbidden from engaging in debates or arguments with SCP-5943.

Description: SCP-5943 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. It stands approximately 30cm tall, and weighs approximately 1.5kg. SCP-5943 possesses distinctive features, including a frightened mouth, nerd glasses for eyes, and a head of unarranged green fur. Its ears are adorned with a jade earring, and it wears a red scarf for an accessory.

SCP-5943 exhibits a highly analytical and logical personality, and revels in debating or arguing with others on a variety of topics. Despite the triviality of some of these topics, SCP-5943 displays a level of passion and intensity in its arguments that is both surprising and amusing.

SCP-5943 has been observed to use its analytical skills to great effect in planning and executing escape attempts. Personnel are advised to be on high alert for any attempts by SCP-5943 to breach its containment. Any attempts by SCP-5943 to engage in debate or argument with personnel must be met with polite dismissal.

Addendum: Dr. █████ has proposed that SCP-5943 be given access to a limited selection of books on philosophical and debate topics, to provide a more stimulating environment for the rabbit. This proposal is pending approval from Site Command.
