Description: SCP-5153 is a male monkey of unknown species, standing at approximately 1.1 meters tall and weighing 25 kilograms.

While this can come across as bossy or intimidating, SCP-5153 only wants to ensure that tasks are executed efficiently and effectively. SCP-5153 has displayed above-average intelligence compared to its species, exhibiting skills such as problem-solving and strategic planning.

SCP-5153's anomalous abilities include heightened physical strength and agility, along with the ability to manipulate and control other primates telepathically. SCP-5153 can communicate and issue commands to primates both in and outside of its immediate vicinity.

SCP-5153 is known to have a history of theft and aggression, displaying a lack of empathy towards other living beings. SCP-5153 has shown no sign of remorse towards its actions and poses a significant threat to personnel and the general public.
