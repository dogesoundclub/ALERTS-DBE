Item #: SCP-4787

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4787 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a maximum of three personnel allowed inside at any given time. SCP-4787 should be provided with normal clothing and a specific work uniform to help maintain a sense of normalcy. Any incidents of forgetfulness or absentmindedness should be reported to Dr. ████████ immediately.

Description: SCP-4787 is a male tiger of an unknown subspecies with blue clown-like eyes. SCP-4787 is currently employed at a fast-food restaurant under Foundation supervision. SCP-4787 has a frightened mouth and wears a red beanie with goggles attached to the forehead. The tiger's ears are pierced with a gold earring, and it wears a silver chain as an accessory. The subject also wears a normal gas mask.

SCP-4787 exhibits forgetful and absentminded tendencies, losing track of time and appointments. This behavior can lead to humorous situations, but it poses additional dangers when working with classified information or dangerous anomalies. SCP-4787 has displayed a satisfactory level of docility and cooperation, and it has shown no signs of aggression.

Addendum: Although it is not a typical Foundation subject, SCP-4787 has proven to be a valuable asset in operations that require low-profile human contacts. The subject's forgetful nature often makes it easier for staff to slip in and out of public areas unnoticed. As of [REDACTED], SCP-4787's employment at the fast-food restaurant under Foundation supervision has been renewed.
