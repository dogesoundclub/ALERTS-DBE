Description: DSC-MATE-1493 is a male human of average height and weight, with parted pink hair and normal glasses. He wears a jade earring on his left ear and a medical mask over his mouth. A goggle is also present on his forehead at all times. DSC-MATE-1493 is frequently seen wearing a silver chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-1493 displays exceptional observation and attention to detail, making him an excellent police officer. However, this trait extends to his personal life as well. DSC-MATE-1493 tends to become overly concerned with giving the “perfect” gift to others and can spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over what to get someone. This behavior has resulted in several incidents where DSC-MATE-1493 has gone to great lengths, including theft and trespassing, to acquire items for gift-giving purposes.

Testing has revealed that DSC-MATE-1493’s gift-giving tendencies are not anomalous, but rather a result of his personality. However, caution should still be exercised when allowing DSC-MATE-1493 to participate in gift-giving events. DSC-MATE-1493 has expressed interest in joining Research Team ██ in order to assist in containment efforts. Request has been pending approval from Site Director.
