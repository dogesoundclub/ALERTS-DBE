Item #: SCP-3597

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3597 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-3597 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-3597 is permitted to work as a doctor at Site-██'s medical facility.

Description: SCP-3597 is a female human with spots on their face and a constant smile. Their eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and they wear a red cross earring. SCP-3597 is often seen wearing a gas mask, the reason for which is currently unknown.

SCP-3597 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which has led them to take on more than they can handle in the past. SCP-3597 has been observed attempting to accomplish an excessive amount of tasks in a single day, or carrying too many objects at once. This behavior can lead to humorous situations, but also puts SCP-3597 at risk of overworking themselves.

SCP-3597 is a skilled doctor, possessing vast medical knowledge and experience. SCP-3597's abilities have proven invaluable to the Foundation's medical staff, and as such, they have been permitted to work at Site-██'s medical facility. However, care must be taken to ensure that SCP-3597 does not overexert themselves.

SCP-3597's gas mask is believed to be a personal item, and they have not shared the reason for its use with Foundation personnel. Further investigation into this item is ongoing.
