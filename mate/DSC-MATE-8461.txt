Item #: SCP-8461

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8461 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. It is authorized to leave its cell for the purpose of approved interviews and press conferences, as well as for recreational activities. However, SCP-8461 must be accompanied by at least one armed guard at all times outside of its containment cell.

Description: SCP-8461 is a human male identified as [REDACTED], who works as a reporter in various news agencies. SCP-8461's most prominent features are the orange stripes on his face and the ski goggle-like eyes. Further physical traits include the metal-tinged purple head, green cross earring on both ears, and a gas mask.

SCP-8461 is particularly skilled in establishing and maintaining deep connections with other individuals, often leading to a significant level of trust and sometimes humor between them. This talent is frequently used to extract information from potential sources, aiding in SCP-8461's journalism work.

SCP-8461's gas mask is a cosmetic disguise, though it claims that it finds comfort in it. Handlers are encouraged to permit SCP-8461 to continue wearing the gas mask.

SCP-8461 became part of the Foundation's notice after a news agency forwarded a transcript of an exclusive interview with SCP-8461 regarding anomalous events. The Foundation's agents took notice and made contact with SCP-8461 soon after.

Addendum 8461-1: During a press conference, SCP-8461 unintentionally revealed its anomalous ability by bringing an outburst of laughter from the audience. The innocuous quip revealed details about the personal lives of several audience members. Due to a lack of restraint in exhibiting its ability, hazard protocols were enacted. SCP-8461 was relocated to Site-██ and continued to serve the Foundation's interests as a press facilitator.
