SCP-4682 is a human female with some peculiar facial features. She has orange stripes running across her cheeks and a deep purple lip color that always seems to be perfect. Her normal glasses sit over her average-sized eyes that don't seem to have any unusual traits. However, her head sports an impressive wing growing from her scalp, appearing to be part of her being seamlessly. Along with her unusual head, she has piercing green cross earrings hanging from her ears. It is unclear whether she had these modifications since birth or acquired them recently.

Whenever she interacts with those around her, she is always seen wearing a medical mask over her mouth that hides any facial expressions. It's also a mystery as to why she chooses to hide them. SCP-4682 is a banker who is often seen wearing a gold chain with a polished black pendant engraved with a logo. It is unclear what the logo represents. In terms of personality, SCP-4682 is a social butterfly and values harmony amongst those around her. She is known for her goofy and playful side and often finds herself telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with others. It can lead to humorous situations and make her an enjoyable person to be around.

While there appears to be nothing anomalous about SCP-4682, her unique physical attributes and charming personality may suggest otherwise. Her behavior is well within human norms, but her striking appearance may raise suspicion. Further observation is required to determine whether SCP-4682 is simply a unique individual or something more.
