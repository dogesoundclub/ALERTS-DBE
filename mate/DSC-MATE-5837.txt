Item #: 5837

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5837 is to be monitored at all times and is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit. Under no circumstances should Item 5837 be allowed access to any form of technology. Item 5837 is to be fed a consistent diet of carrots, lettuce, and apples. Any deviation from this diet must be approved by on-site personnel.

Description: Item 5837 appears to be a common rabbit, given the designation "Car Salesman" due to its anomalous abilities. The rabbit stands upright and is roughly 2 feet tall when fully stretched out. The rabbit has Jade LED eyes and a frightened mouth, which appears to be a result of constant terror that it may forget something.

Item 5837 wears a purple cap with a headset, a jade earring, a silver chain, and carries a whistle. These items appear to enhance the rabbit's ability to sell cars, although the exact nature of the rabbit's powers remains unknown.

The rabbit's primary weakness is its tendency to become absent-minded and forgetful, particularly when caught up in work or mission critical events. This has caused several complications during testing including missed appointments, forgotten protocols, and sporadic episodes of erratic behavior.

Currently, no known method exists for reversing the abilities of Item 5837. Further research is ongoing.
