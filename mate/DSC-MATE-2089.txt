Item #: 2089

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2089 is no longer under Foundation custody and operates as a regular Traffic Officer within the city limits. Monitoring of her activities is to be done through a covert observational team, and any abnormalities in her behavior must be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation outpost.

Description: Subject 2089 appears to be a human female of average height and build, with unique face features that distinguish her from the average human. She sports orange stripes all over her face and has a smile that is always endearing. Her eyes are an unusual VR Jade LED that appears to offer her increased visual capabilities. The top of her head has a wing-like appendage that seems to be non-functional and serves only as an aesthetic addition. She may be seen wearing a green cross earring and an LED Gas Mask, which glows in various colors.

Subject 2089 displays a thirst for knowledge that is rare in the average human population. She has a deep love of learning and spends much of her free time reading books, researching obscure topics and delving into documentaries that expand her consciousness. She is highly intellectual and spends a significant amount of effort sharing her newfound knowledge with anyone she comes across.

The extent of Subject 2089's abilities when it comes to her gas mask and her unique facial and eye features is still being studied. However, aside from appearing unusual in appearance, she exhibits no supernatural abilities, and her interests and occupation fit well within her human range.

Addendum: Subject 2089 has reported that her gas mask, earring, and helmet are all dimensions hopping equipment. Agents are currently investigating these allegations.
