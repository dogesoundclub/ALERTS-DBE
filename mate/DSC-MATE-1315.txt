Item #: 1315

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1315 is to be kept in a reinforced, electromagnetically shielded containment unit at all times. To prevent any potential escape attempts, the unit must be power-washed twice a week to ensure that no rust or debris accumulates around the hinges or seals. Personnel tasked with maintaining Item 1315's containment must exercise extreme caution, as the villainous item has been known to use its psychic powers against anyone who attempts to approach it without caution.

Description: Item 1315 appears to be a humanoid robot with a single green cyclops eye that glows menacingly. Its eyes flicker and pulse with a VR rainbow LED pattern, while the robot's ears are adorned with a jade earring. The robot is fond of wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle around its neck. Its metallic body is approximately six feet tall, and it emits a faint humming noise when not in use. The robot's AI is highly advanced and can communicate in several languages, though it tends to speak with an ominous and threatening tone.

Personality: Item 1315 has been known to possess a strong sense of intuition, bordering on the psychic. This ability allows it to predict future events and detect the emotions of others, which can be both impressive and unnerving. The robot is extremely cunning and manipulative, often using its psychic abilities to intimidate or control those around it. It is violent and dangerous when provoked, making it a formidable villain in any urban fantasy setting.

Addendum: Personnel are reminded that Item 1315 is not to be underestimated. Its psychic abilities make it a formidable adversary, and it should be approached with extreme caution. Any attempts to communicate with or control the robot should be reported to the containment team immediately.
