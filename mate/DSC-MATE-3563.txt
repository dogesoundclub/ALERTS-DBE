Item #: 3563

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3563 is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██ when not in use. Any interactions with SCP-3563 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3563 is a robot police officer, resembling a humanoid male with a green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. SCP-3563 wears nerd glasses and a red cross earring on the left earlobe, along with a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-3563's programming is designed to be idealistic, with a strong desire to make the world a better place. As a result, SCP-3563 has been known to engage in protests or boycotts against entities that SCP-3563 feels goes against its values.

Despite its robot nature, SCP-3563 has been observed smoking a cigarette, apparently for stress relief.

Addendum: After several incidents involving SCP-3563's idealistic nature clashing with Foundation protocols, it has been recommended that SCP-3563's programming should be re-evaluated and possibly adjusted.
