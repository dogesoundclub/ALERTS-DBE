Item #: DSC-MATE-454

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-454 is to be contained in a specially designed enclosure suitable for large predators. The enclosure must be secured with high-voltage electric fences and monitored by armed guards at all times. DSC-MATE-454 must be fed a regular diet consisting of raw meat, and any changes to its diet must be approved by the Site Director. All personnel must wear earplugs and maintain a distance of at least 20 meters from DSC-MATE-454 at all times, as it has been known to emit a sonic attack capable of disorienting and injuring humans.

Description: DSC-MATE-454 is a male tiger with distinctive horned rim glasses. Its facial expression is frequently overwhelmed, with a frightened mouth that suggests anxiety or panic. DSC-MATE-454's head is not arranged green, resulting in a patchy and inconsistent fur pattern. It wears a silver chain necklace and carries a whistle with it at all times, which it occasionally uses to attract attention.

DSC-MATE-454's personality is characterized by a love for adventure and experimentation. This has led to several humorous incidents, including a near-death experience while bungee jumping and getting lost in the wilderness. Its behavior is unpredictable and occasionally dangerous, and it should never be left unsupervised.

DSC-MATE-454 was originally captured in the wilds of India, where it was discovered living on a farm. It is unclear if it is a natural tiger with unusual abilities or if it was the result of an experimental breeding program. Further research is necessary to determine its origin and any potential anomalies associated with its behavior.

Addendum: Dr. ██████ has suggested the possibility of using DSC-MATE-454 as a potential agent for field work in dangerous or difficult environments, given its unusual abilities and love of risk-taking. However, this proposal has been met with skepticism, as DSC-MATE-454's behavior is highly erratic and would likely pose a significant risk to the Foundation's personnel.
