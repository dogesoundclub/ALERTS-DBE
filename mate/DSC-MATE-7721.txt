SCP-7721, also known as "The Rabbit Salesman," is a humanoid rabbit of unknown origin. Sporting a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring, SCP-7721 appears to be a used car salesman by profession. But don't be fooled by his seemingly mundane job, as SCP-7721 has a unique skill that makes him more than just your average salesman.

SCP-7721 possesses a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard. Despite his unassuming appearance, he has a talent for delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. But beware, as his humor can also come with a hint of snarkiness that can rub some people the wrong way.

What's more, SCP-7721's gold chain may indicate that he has connections to other anomalous entities, though it is currently unknown what these connections may entail. Efforts to establish contact with any potential associates are ongoing.

As with all anomalous entities, caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-7721. While he may appear harmless, his anomalous abilities could be more powerful than they appear on the surface. Approach with care.
