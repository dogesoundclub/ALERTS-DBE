Item #: 9297

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9297 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber onsite at Site-██. DSC-MATE-9297's chamber is to be equipped with standard electrical outlets and surge protectors. DSC-MATE-9297 is allowed access to non-conductive materials and tools under supervision. 

DSC-MATE-9297 may be permitted to perform electrical work on-site at Staff's discretion, if deemed necessary for Site operations.

It should be noted that DSC-MATE-9297 is equipped with an implanted pacemaker; any malfunctions in electrical containment or electrical failure within his cell may cause severe health risks.

Description: DSC-MATE-9297 is a sapient male rabbit, measuring approximately 60cm in height (ears included) and weighing 3.6kg. DSC-MATE-9297 appears to have been surgically modified to possess opposable digits on his forelimbs, and possesses significant knowledge in electrical engineering, particularly with regard to repairs and maintenance of on-site electrical systems. 

DSC-MATE-9297's facial features include a constant and easily recognizable expression of fright. Additionally, DSC-MATE-9297 wears a retro cap and horn-rimmed glasses with gold earrings, and is often seen wearing a silver chain and smoking cigarettes.

DSC-MATE-9297 has shown a tendency to brainstorm creative solutions to electrical problems or barriers, even at the expense of logical feasibility, often causing humor among site personnel. DSC-MATE-9297 is of a cautious demeanor; it is reluctant to perform work outside its chamber, and will refuse if it believes that it is too risky or that it is being watched by an unknown entity.

Addendum: Following Incident 9297-B, DSC-MATE-9297's containment has been reviewed and enforced with stricter regulation. DSC-MATE-9297 is no longer cleared to perform electrical work unsupervised or leave its cell except for approved jobs. Additionally, DSC-MATE-9297 has been issued a directive to report any anomalous events or suspicious activity to Site personnel. DSC-MATE-9297 has since complied with all revised directives.
