Item #: SCP-946

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-946 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. All maintenance and repairs are to be conducted by qualified Foundation personnel. Only authorized personnel with clearance level 2 or higher are allowed to interact with SCP-946.

Description: SCP-946 is an electrician robot of unknown manufacture. It stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 180 kilograms. Its body is made of durable metal alloy with a matte black finish. SCP-946's head features a red beanie and a gold earring on its left ear. Its VR jade LED eyes glow when it is active. The robot's mouth is covered by a medical mask, and it wears a red scarf around its neck.

SCP-946's programming has given it a strong sense of duty and responsibility, leading it to take on more tasks than it can handle. On occasion, this has resulted in humorous situations, such as trying to carry too many objects at once, or trying to complete all of its tasks in a single day. SCP-946's personality is largely docile and cooperative, but it may become agitated if it feels that its responsibilities are being neglected or overlooked.

Addendum: SCP-946 was acquired by the Foundation during a routine inspection of a robotics facility in [REDACTED]. Its creator is unknown, but it is believed to have been created for use in industrial and infrastructure maintenance. Its advanced AI programming and electrical engineering capabilities make it a valuable asset to the Foundation.
