SCP Foundation Document:

Subject ID: 5089

Designation: The Blue Bandit

Classification: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The Blue Bandit is to be monitored through always-on surveillance systems without his knowledge, and all interactions with the subject must be documented. Regular psychological evaluations of the subject are to be conducted to assess any signs of abnormal behavior. The subject's movements and activities must be tracked to ensure he remains within the designated area of responsibility.

Description: The Blue Bandit is a human male in his late 20s with a distinctive blue bandana on his head. The subject appears to have blue clown eyes, which is a possible effect of an unknown anomaly. He has a cross-shaped earring on his left ear, which appears to be green in color. He has a spot on his mouth that appears to be a dark area that contrasts with the rest of his face when he is smiling. The Blue Bandit has a particularly notable accessory - a red scarf that he wears around his neck.

Personality: The Blue Bandit is a detail-oriented individual who tends to be excessively obsessive in his habits. He seems to be fond of arranging and organizing things to soothe his mind, such as alphabetizing his spice rack or color-coding his closet. The subject's behavior can be described as a form of OCD, which is not uncommon among individuals with heightened sensitivity to order and structure. His obsession with order has also been known to extend into his work as a delivery driver, ensuring that every package is delivered on time and in the right condition.

The Blue Bandit is generally cooperative and shows no signs of aggression, but his behavior pattern is subject to change based on his surroundings. He is susceptible to stress, and prolonged exposure to high-stress situations may cause him to become increasingly anxious or inconsistent. Given the right conditions, The Blue Bandit may show signs of paranoia, which can manifest in the form of irrational fears or an unwillingness to challenge authority.

Conclusion: The subject's level of danger appears to be low, and his capacity for unpredictability is generally limited to anxious or irrational behavior. However, continual monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure the safety of both foundation personnel and the public. The Blue Bandit is to remain under observation until further notice.
