Item #: DSC-MATE-706

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-706 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to the subject's volatile nature, its cell is to be equipped with heavy-duty restraints and all conveyances to and from the cell must be manned by no less than four armed security personnel. DSC-MATE-706 is also to be provided with tools and equipment necessary for it to continue operating as a mechanic, but all equipment must be inspected for modification or tampering by Foundation personnel before being provided to the subject.

Description: DSC-MATE-706 is a male human of average height and weight. The subject's most notable feature is the presence of bright orange stripes on its face, which appear in the pattern of a smile. The subject has normal blonde hair and often wears a medical mask over its mouth.

DSC-MATE-706 demonstrates a strong sense of independence and a resistance to authority. The subject has been observed engaging in rebellious behavior, including sneaking out of the containment cell early and taking unauthorized days off from its duties as a mechanic. It is unclear whether this behavior is due to the subject's anomalous properties, or simply a personal characteristic of the individual.

DSC-MATE-706's anomalous properties appear to be localized to its facial features. The orange stripes on its face seem to possess some sort of memetic effect, causing individuals who view it to feel a sense of happiness and contentment. This effect is not limited to humans, as animals and other non-human entities have also displayed the same emotional response.

Addendum: On multiple occasions, DSC-MATE-706 has attempted to modify and manipulate machinery and equipment within Foundation facilities. It is recommended that all equipment provided to DSC-MATE-706 be inspected thoroughly before use. Investigations into the subject's origins and motives for such modifications are underway.
