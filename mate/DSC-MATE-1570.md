Item #: 1570

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1570 is to be kept in a secure cell at all times. The cell must be equipped with reinforced steel walls and soundproofing materials to prevent subject 1570 from communicating with any outside sources. Daily mental health evaluations are to be conducted to ensure that the subject is in a stable and obedient state. Any attempt at communication from subject 1570 must be recorded and monitored for the safety of both staff and the general public.

Description: Subject 1570 is a male monkey with red clown eyes. It wears a doge hat on its head and a jade earring on each ear. In addition, it is often seen with a burning cigarette held between its fingers, which seems to be an almost permanent fixture. Despite its odd physical appearance, it has been identified as a successful news anchor working at a major television station.

The exact species of subject 1570 remains unknown, but it has displayed remarkable intelligence and an exceptional speaking ability for a primate of its size. It is known to have an interest in creative activities such as painting, drawing, and writing, although its involvement in such activities is not regularly observed. It is suspected that these activities serve as an outlet for any frustrations that may develop during containment.

Despite an apparent affinity for creative pursuits, staff members are advised to maintain a safe distance when interacting with subject 1570. Its unpredictable behavior and tendency to lash out make approaching it an extremely dangerous undertaking, particularly when its emotional state appears unstable.

Analysis of subject 1570's unusual appearance and demeanor suggest that the monkey has been subjected to some sort of anomalous alteration, although its source and purpose remain unknown. It is recommended that further research be conducted to shed light on the origins and possible implications of the subject's existence.
