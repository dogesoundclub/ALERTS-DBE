Description: DSC-MATE-7475 is a male humanoid of the tiger species, who wears a doge hat on its head, gold earring on its ears and a medical mask on its mouth. DSC-MATE-7475 is often seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory. It is a fast food worker by profession and was discovered by Department of Unusual Occurrences while investigating claims of an animal in human attire.

DSC-MATE-7475 displays a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when they need it. This behavior leads to humorous situations, such as trying to move heavy furniture by themselves or refusing to use a map when lost.

DSC-MATE-7475 displays no overtly aggressive behavior, and its actions are primarily focused on self-preservation. However, its interactions have raised several questions that require further investigation. Researchers suspect that DSC-MATE-7475 possesses an acute sense of smell, due to their heightened senses, which may give clue of the location of other anomalies. DSC-MATE-7475 has shown an above-average intelligence level and the potential to learn new things.

Addendum: During a routine medical examination, DSC-MATE-7475 became agitated and showed several signs of discomfort. Upon further examination by the medical staff, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-7475 has bright yellow eyes. However, the reason behind this brightness is unclear and requires further investigation.

DSC-MATE-7475 Interview Log:

Interviewer: Dr. Johnson

Interviewee: DSC-MATE-7475

Dr. Johnson: DSC-MATE-7475, can you tell us about your job at the fast food outlet?

DSC-MATE-7475: Sure, I like it there, it pays my bills, and I get to eat all the meat I want.

Dr. Johnson: How does your species react to cooked food?

DSC-MATE-7475: Well, we tigers can eat cooked or raw meat, but I prefer it raw. Cooked food takes away the natural flavor.

Dr. Johnson: Interesting. Can you tell us about your sense of smell?

DSC-MATE-7475: Sure. My sense of smell is very sharp. It helps me identify food, people and their intentions. But, at times it can be a curse too. I can detect emotions I am not supposed to know, like when someone is lying to me or in distress.

Dr. Johnson: That's fascinating. Thank you DSC-MATE-7475, that will be all for now.

DSC-MATE-7475: Anytime.
