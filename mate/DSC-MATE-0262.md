Item #: 262

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 262 is to be monitored closely but allowed to continue his duties as a police officer. He must undergo regular psychological evaluations to ensure mental stability.

Description: Item 262 is a human male with significant orange stripes on his face. He wears a short peak cap and nerd glasses. On his forehead, he keeps a goggle. He often has a smile on his face and wears a gold chain and candy stick around his neck.

Personality: Item 262 has an uncanny sense of intuition, which makes them appear as though they possess psychic powers. They can predict events before they happen or sense when people are feeling anxious or upset. This ability is both impressive and unsettling, making him an enigmatic figure.

Addendum: Item 262's exceptional abilities were discovered after unusual events in the area that he polices were brought to the attention of the DogeSoundClub. Despite being scouted for several years, no evidence suggests that he is aware of his abilities. The Foundation has concluded that his abilities result from phenomena beyond conscious understanding, and as such, further research into Item 262 remains of paramount significance.
