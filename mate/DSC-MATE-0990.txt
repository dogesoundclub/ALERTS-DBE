Item #: 990

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-990 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-990 must be recorded for further analysis. SCP-990 is currently employed as a car salesman at ██████████ Car Dealership, and must be monitored for any potential anomalous activity.

Description: SCP-990 is a female human with distinctive features. Her lips are purple, and she has rainbow LED eyes, with an orange side head and red cross earrings. SCP-990 is often seen wearing a choker and an LED gas mask. Due to these unique features, SCP-990 can be easily identified in public.

SCP-990 possesses a strong sense of independence and often rebels against authority. She may sneak out of the office early or take days off without permission. SCP-990 prefers to work alone, and her social interactions are often limited to strictly professional settings.

SCP-990's behavior suggests that she may possess some form of anomalous ability; however, further research is needed to determine the extent of her abilities. Until then, SCP-990 will remain under strict observation and containment.

Note: SCP-990 has proven to be a valuable asset in the acquisition of reliable transportation. However, caution should be taken when interacting with her, as she may attempt to use her abilities to elude SCP Foundation personnel.
