Description:

SCP-5139 is a male Bengal tiger with a blue bandana on its head, a jade earring in each ear, and Red Scarf as its accessory. It has VR Jade LED eyes and wears a medical mask over its mouth. SCP-5139 is capable of locomotion and drives a subway train for [REDACTED] metro. While SCP-5139 possesses attributes of an average tiger, its intellect, and aptitude are seen to be well above expected animal capabilities. It has been observed over the years that SCP-5139 displays an unusual awareness of human societal systems.

Personality:

SCP-5139 displays numerous beneficial characteristics, including efficiency, punctuality, and diligence regarding work. However, a possible side effect of SCP-5139's superior cognitive capabilities is a tendency to become easily distracted and scatterbrained, which could result in anomalous incidents. SCP-5139 can sometimes overlook essential details, leading to humorous but potentially hazardous incidents such as missed stops and misrouted trains. 

SCP-5139 appears to be in a constant state of contemplation, as if always trying to make decisions while navigating human social structures. SCP-5139 holds deep empathy and compassion for humans and other animals, exhibiting a preference for protecting them. It has shown behavior indicative of being possessive of humans it likes and actively protective of them. 

During transport on its train, interviews with passengers reveal that SCP-5139 has enabled them to experience a sense of security and relaxation that they do not receive from the transportation system's ordinary services. SCP-5139 has attracted public curiosity, with rumors circulating about a tiger driving a subway train recently. The public may be aware of SCP-5139's presence, and Foundation staff are recommended to adhere to strict cover stories. 

Addendum 5139-2:

During a routine physical examination, it was observed that SCP-5139 has an abnormal mass of brain tissue, possibly explaining its advanced cognitive abilities. Further study will be conducted to learn the extent of the abnormality and how it facilitated SCP-5139's abilities.
