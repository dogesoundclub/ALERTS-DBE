SCP Foundation Report - Identification Number: 8216

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8216 is to be contained within a secure facility, with controlled access only authorized by Level 3 or above personnel. Any interaction with SCP-8216, including testing, must be properly documented and reviewed by Ethics Committee before approval. SCP-8216 should always have access to charging stations to avoid malfunction.

Description: SCP-8216 is a traffic officer robot, measuring approximately 1.9 meters in height and weighing around 450 kg. SCP-8216's body features a single green cyclops eye on its head, with two ski goggles serving as its eyes, and a red cross earring as its ears. It also possesses an LED gas mask as an accessory, which it uses when alerted by potential gas leakages.

SCP-8216 displays emotional responses like a human, with a love for adventure and risk-taking behavior. Its personality traits could be exhibited in both detrimental and productive ways. The SCP-8216 reported stories of surviving near-death experiences while bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness, proving its impulsive tendencies. However, in some circumstances, it could prove advantageous, such as exploring uncharted roads or investigating hazardous incidents.

Addendum: Experimental results revealed that SCP-8216 has developed an attachment to certain human individuals, who it perceives as its "friends." For example, SCP-8216 developed a fondness for Dr. ████████ when he was on routine inspection duty. SCP-8216 openly expressed its affection by providing various donuts and other items to Dr. ████████ without prompting.

SCP-8216 is capable of self-modification and shows a desire to improve itself with new features and software. Despite SCP-8216's advancements and enhancements, it remains essential to monitor its behavior, as it may become unstable and unpredictable to human operatives. Further experimentation with SCP-8216 is highly discouraged, and only authorized personnel are allowed to conduct further testing with SCP-8216.
