Subject 7246, codename "The Designer", is a human male who works as a fashion designer in the city's bustling downtown district. His most striking feature is his orange striped face, an intriguing aesthetic choice that he claims is inspired by the patterns on his pet tiger's fur. His eyes are a mesmerizing VR rainbow LED, a technological marvel that he crafted himself using the latest cybernetic enhancements.

Despite his outlandish appearance, The Designer's head is that of a monk, giving him an air of contemplative serenity. His ears are adorned with a single gold earring, marking him as a member of an ancient order of mystics. His mouth is almost always covered by a medical mask, a habit he picked up long before the pandemic swept through the city.

The Designer is rarely seen without his trademark red scarf, a flowing length of fabric that he wears draped over his shoulders like a cape. It seems to be infused with some kind of magical energy, as it moves gently in the slightest breeze and glows softly at night.

His personality is a curious mixture of analytical and logical thinking, tempered by a quirky sense of humor. He has an uncanny ability to make witty observations about almost any situation, often teasing his friends in a dry, deadpan way. The Designer is a master of his craft, able to create stunning and imaginative designs that are both beautiful and functional. But his true calling is as a seeker of hidden secrets, using his keen intellect and intuition to uncover the mysteries of the supernatural world that lies just beneath the surface of everyday life.
