Item #: SCP-5693

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its highly dangerous abilities, SCP-5693 is to be contained within a specialized enclosure at Site-██. All personnel assigned to work with SCP-5693 must have received prior training in dealing with aggressive and unpredictable entities.

Description: SCP-5693 is a male monkey of unknown origin, standing at approximately 3 feet tall with a mohawk hairstyle. It wears a pair of normal glasses over its eyes, and a goggle on its forehead. It has a gold earring on each ear, which appear to be purely decorative.

SCP-5693 is highly intelligent, and shows signs of advanced cognitive abilities. It displays a tendency towards being very organized and efficient, which can at times come across as controlling. SCP-5693 has been known to take charge of group projects, delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way.

SCP-5693 is capable of inducing a compulsion effect within individuals who gaze into its eyes, leading to the affected party becoming increasingly aggressive and uncontrollable. It is also capable of projecting a telekinetic force, which it usually uses to throw objects at high speeds.

Addendum: Incident Report 5693-1

On ██/██/██, SCP-5693 managed to breach containment, injuring ██ personnel in the process. It was eventually recaptured and contained, but not before causing extensive damage to Site-██. It is recommended that additional security measures be put in place to prevent future breaches.
