DSC-MATE-6950 is a human male, designated as Doctor for his medical expertise. He is easily recognizable by the spots covering his face and the LED rainbow lights that replace his eyes. Hallucinatory or not, DSC-MATE-6950 has shown to be effective in connecting with patients and making them feel understood. His head is made of an unknown purple metal and he has a single gold earring on his left ear. He wears a silver chain that he uses to fiddle with when deep in thought. 

DSC-MATE-6950's personality is defined by his nurturing nature. He cares deeply for his patients and will go out of his way to ensure they are comfortable and well taken care of. His kindness extends beyond just living beings and he is known to give pet names to his belongings, plants, and even inanimate objects such as chairs, desks, and staplers. It has been noted that he can take care of his patients' emotional well-being just as well, and he is often regarded as a positive influence by those who have interacted with him. 

Note: DSC-MATE-6950's LED eyes are not to be tampered with, as it has been reported that prolonged eye contact has caused hallucinations or even seizures. If any unusual activity is observed, DSC-MATE-6950 is to be transferred to a containment unit for further study.
