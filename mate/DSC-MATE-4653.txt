Item #: SCP-4653

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4653 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber should be equipped with appropriate food, water, and entertainment for a humanoid subject. SCP-4653 must not be allowed access to any news outlets or be involved in any broadcasting or media activities.

SCP-4653's containment chamber is to be monitored 24/7 for any signs of abnormal behavior or unauthorized communication attempts. In the event that SCP-4653 is found attempting to communicate with the outside world, all communication attempts are to be immediately terminated and SCP-4653 must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation.

Description: SCP-4653 is a male humanoid rabbit approximately 5'5" in height with green hair and a purple cap. SCP-4653 possesses a pair of jade earrings and a candy stick, which he is often seen holding. SCP-4653's features include a frightened mouth, two-color headband, and eyes that appear indistinguishable from that of a human.

SCP-4653's personality is characterized by their strong value for tradition, which may manifest in a no-nonsense attitude. SCP-4653 also exhibits a playful side, often telling jokes or stories that have been passed down through their family or community.

SCP-4653 was discovered working as a news anchor for a local station when Foundation agents investigated a series of reports suggesting a creature similar in appearance to SCP-4653 was involved in an outbreak of anomalous behavior. It remains unclear whether SCP-4653 was involved in these events or if it was a coincidence.

Addendum: SCP-4653's media presence has been identified as a potential national security issue by Foundation intelligence staff. Measures to contain information regarding SCP-4653 have been implemented, and additional research is underway to determine the extent of SCP-4653's abilities and anomalies.
