Item #: 9547

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9547 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and provided with appropriate living conditions consistent with that of a domesticated rabbit. All personnel entering SCP-9547's containment area must wear green protective suits and follow standard procedures for handling and interacting with domesticated animals.

Description: SCP-9547 is a male rabbit that appears to have undergone genetic modification to enhance its physical appearance. It has jade-colored LED eyes, wears a doge hat on its head, a jade earring on each ear, a silver chain around its neck, and carries a candy stick as an accessory. It stands at approximately 30 cm in height and has a weight of around 2 kg.

SCP-9547 shows a propensity for anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, displaying an innate nurturing and caring disposition that extends beyond living things. It is observed to give names to objects like its car or furniture and holds conversations with them. SCP-9547 remains cooperative with Foundation personnel and has exhibited no signs of hostility.

Addendum: SCP-9547 was brought to the Foundation's attention after reports of a talking rabbit that walked upright and carried a candy stick were made to local authorities. Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 ("Bunny Hop") was dispatched to retrieve SCP-9547 and contained it without incident. No information regarding how SCP-9547 underwent its physical modifications has been found. Studies into using SCP-9547's genetic modification to enhance future Foundation projects are ongoing.
