It appears to have exceptional observation skills and can read people's emotions and body language. Its behavior has been described as both impressive and eerie by those who have interacted with it.

Addendum 6523-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-6523 exhibited unusual behavior during a performance at the theater. Several members of the audience reported feeling a sense of unease and anxiety during the play, which DSC-MATE-6523 seemed to be aware of. It interrupted the performance to address the audience and offer words of comfort, which seemed to calm the audience.

After the performance, DSC-MATE-6523 appeared to have a mental breakdown and refused to return to its containment unit. It claimed to have sensed a great danger coming and insisted that it needed to warn the Foundation. It took three security personnel to subdue DSC-MATE-6523 and return it to its containment unit.

Further evaluation of DSC-MATE-6523's predictions is currently underway. The incident has raised concerns about the extent of DSC-MATE-6523's abilities and the potential threat it may pose to Foundation security.
