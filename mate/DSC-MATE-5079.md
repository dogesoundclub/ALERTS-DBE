Item #: DSC-MATE-5079

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5079 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The medical mask worn by DSC-MATE-5079 must be kept in place at all times when DSC-MATE-5079 is outside of her cell or interacting with personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-5079 is a female human of average height and build, with metal blue hair styled in a pixie cut. DSC-MATE-5079's ears are pierced and decorated with green cross earrings. DSC-MATE-5079's most prominent facial feature is a bright smile, visible underneath the medical mask she always wears.

DSC-MATE-5079's behavior is characterized by a strong sense of organization and planning, along with a spontaneous streak. DSC-MATE-5079 prefers to have a plan and stick to it, but she isn't afraid to change things up on a whim. This has resulted in some humorous situations, such as spur-of-the-moment adventures and last-minute party planning that turned out to be a hit.

DSC-MATE-5079's primary role is as a doctor, utilizing her medical knowledge to help both Foundation personnel and contained anomalies. DSC-MATE-5079 is also skilled in improvisation, making her valuable in situations where medical supplies may be limited or unavailable.

DSC-MATE-5079 wears a gold chain around her neck, which she claims was a gift from her late grandmother. The chain itself does not appear to have any anomalous properties.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5079 has expressed interest in exploring and documenting the various anomalies contained by the Foundation. However, due to the unpredictable nature of these phenomena, this proposal has been denied for the time being.
