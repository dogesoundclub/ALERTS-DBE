Item #: SCP-8533

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8533 is to be eliminated on sight if found outside of Site-██. Should SCP-8533 still be alive within the site boundaries, it must be kept in a locked containment chamber with no outside stimuli.

Description: SCP-8533 is a sentient, sapient rabbit species with an unusual set of features. It stands at 70 centimeters and weighs 5.5 kg. Its nerdy glasses grant enhanced sight abilities and allow it to see in the dark. SCP-8533 also wears a retro cap, with a two-color band on its forehead and goggles resting on top of its cap.

SCP-8533 sports an earring made of jade and wears a red scarf around its neck, along with carrying a whistle for security purposes as a guard. SCP-8533 is highly intelligent and known for its quick wit and love of debate, often engaging in friendly arguments with friends or family members just for fun. 

SCP-8533 exhibits no extraordinary physical abilities but has been highly skilled in security measures and is known to be a valuable asset in Site-██, where it currently resides. Despite its playful personality, SCP-8533 has a tendency to become hostile when it feels threatened, and all staff should exercise caution when in its presence.

Addendum: An incident occurred on ██/██/████, resulting in containment breach of SCP-8533. The creature escaped from its containment chamber and was found in the lower floors of the Site-██ facility. All security teams were mobilized, and SCP-8533 was successfully taken down. The entire facility was placed under emergency lockdown, and there were no casualties reported. The investigation is ongoing, as SCP-8533's activities and intentions during the containment breach remain uncertain.
