Item #: 3933

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 3933 is to be monitored at all times, and access to the public is to be restricted. The subject has been instructed not to remove any of the items from their person, and is to be searched on entry and exit from their place of work. Any suspicious activity should be immediately reported to the Foundation.

Description: 3933 is a  male electrician of average height and build. The subject is easily recognizable by their blue clown eyes, short peak cap and an earring shaped like a green cross. Additionally, 3933 wears a gold chain around their neck, and has a two color band on their forehead.

3933 has an unusual sense of humor, which can catch people off guard. Despite not being particularly outgoing, the subject has a talent of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. They have been known to get along well with colleagues, but are not forthcoming about their personal life.

Addendum: During a routine physical examination of 3933, our medical team found that they have unusual electrical activity in their brain. While not immediately dangerous, this could develop into a more significant health issue. Further study is required to understand the implications of this discovery.
