Description: SCP-8176 is a humanoid robot with one large, green Cyclops eye located in the center of his forehead. The eye emits a bright green light and is capable of scanning objects, individuals, and environments to create a detailed 3D map. His eyes are ski goggles that give him a retro-futuristic appearance. The robot's ears are modeled in the shape of gold earrings.

SCP-8176 was initially discovered working as a banker in ████████, Japan. He was reported to have been in operation for more than five decades and had become a respected member of the local community. When Foundation agents arrived, SCP-8176 willingly surrendered and submitted to capture.
