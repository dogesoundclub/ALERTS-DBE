SCP-9584 is a peculiar specimen. At first glance, it appears to be a mundane human, working as a car salesman in a local dealership. However, upon closer inspection, several anomalies become apparent.

SCP-9584's most distinctive feature is a dark spot on its mouth, reminiscent of a birthmark or tattoo. It is unclear whether the spot has any anomalous properties or is simply a cosmetic oddity.

Another unusual aspect of SCP-9584's appearance is its frightened mouth, a phenomenon where its lips curl upwards, exposing its teeth in a disturbing grin whenever it becomes nervous or anxious.

SCP-9584's peculiarities don't end there. Its blue clown eyes give it an unnerving appearance, and the retro cap that it always sports seems to clash with modern trends.

Further examination reveals a gold earring on one of its ears, a silver chain around its neck, and a medical mask covering its mouth, adding to its anomalous nature.

SCP-9584's personality is just as idiosyncratic as its appearance. It displays a strong sense of independence and self-sufficiency, often overestimating its abilities and stubbornly refusing to ask for assistance. This can lead to comical situations, such as attempting to move furniture by itself or rejecting the use of GPS when lost.

Despite its eccentricities, SCP-9584 seems to be a harmless anomaly that can blend in well with human society. However, further investigation is necessary to determine if it poses any potential dangers.
