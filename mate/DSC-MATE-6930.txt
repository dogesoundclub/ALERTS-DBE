SCP-6930, designated as "The Striped Lawyer," is a human female with distinctive orange stripes that run along her cheeks and forehead. Her lips are a bold shade of purple and are often adorned with glossy lipstick. One of her most striking features is a two-colored band that sits above her eyebrows, which seems to shimmer in the light.

She is often seen wearing a choker around her neck and jade earrings in her ears. Despite her unique appearance, SCP-6930 is a successful lawyer and has displayed exceptional analytical and deductive skills. Her energy and enthusiasm are infectious, and she has a knack for getting others excited about things that they may not have initially found interesting.

However, her enthusiasm sometimes borders on obsessive, causing her to become overly focused on a single task or idea to the point where it becomes a detriment. This has led to several incidents where SCP-6930 has caused significant disruptions in the workplace and even resulted in disciplinary action.

Overall, SCP-6930's unique appearance and vibrant personality make her a valuable member of any team, but caution should be exercised to prevent her from becoming too fixated on a particular project or idea.
