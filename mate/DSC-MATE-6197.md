Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6197 is to be kept in a secure containment locker with NO external connectivity. No communication or contact is allowed without proper clearance from a senior researcher. Any unauthorized access is strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-6197 is a sentient train driver robot designed for passenger services. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall and is distinguishable by its retro cap and medical mask. Its main body is made of metals and electronic components of varying types. It possesses a gold chain and a gold earring as its personal accessories.

DSC-MATE-6197 has a tendency to get sidetracked easily, often forgetting crucial mission objectives, which can lead to dangerous situations. In instances of such forgetfulness, the robot experiences an increase in stress levels, and its mouth takes a frightened shape.

DSC-MATE-6197's personality is that of a gentle and eager-to-please train operator. Its tendency to be scatterbrained can lead to amusing incidents for onlookers, but poses a threat to the safety of passengers.

Addendum 6197-1: Retrieval

DSC-MATE-6197 was discovered in a remote train station in the outskirts of █████. Passengers reported unusual behavior from the train and repeated relapses from the driver's cabin. An investigation carried out by the Foundation led to the discovery of DSC-MATE-6197, who had been abandoned in the train's cabin.

Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-6197's programming had been tampered with, causing its erratic behavior. The creators of DSC-MATE-6197 remain unknown.

Addendum 6197-2: Improvement Program

Researcher █████ proposed a program of improvement for DSC-MATE-6197's defective programming. The program will entail restructuring DSC-MATE-6197's memory and updating its operating system. Successful completion of this program is expected to decrease the risk factor of DSC-MATE-6197.

Note from Researcher █████: DSC-MATE-6197 is one of the most charming and fascinating anomalies I've had the pleasure to work with. With the improvement program, we can make sure that it will experience no further distress, and passengers can expect safe journeys from the train.
