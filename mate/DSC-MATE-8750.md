Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8750 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be regularly checked for any damages that may occur due to DSC-MATE-8750's species.

DSC-MATE-8750 is required to wear a medical mask at all times due to the risk of cross-species contamination. Any injury must be reported immediately to the medical team for proper treatment.

DSC-MATE-8750 must be assigned to a security position within the facility to ensure proper security measures.

Description: DSC-MATE-8750 is a tiger male humanoid with red victory band around his forehead and a red cross earring on each ear. He wears a purple cap with a headset and horned rim glasses. The subject has a frightened mouth feature, which presents as a down-turned expression, and is often seen stoic.

DSC-MATE-8750 presents a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when in need of assistance. This trait also poses a risk to its own health due to its reluctance to seek medical attention.

DSC-MATE-8750 has been assigned as a security guard within the foundation. Due to its species, it presents a higher risk of causing unintentional property damages if not properly contained.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8750 keeps attempting to move heavy equipment without asking for help from its colleagues, even when it's necessary to do so, resulting in minor property damage. DSC-MATE-8750 will undergo minor security training programs to prevent repeated incidents.
