Item #: SCP-5450

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5450 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with access to legal materials for work purposes. She is allowed to smoke cigarettes in designated areas of the facility. SCP-5450 is to receive regular therapy sessions to manage her tendency to take on others' problems.

Description: SCP-5450 is a female human with distinctive spots on her face and a smile that is often described as charming. She has green hair and wears a purple cap. SCP-5450 also has a two-color band on her forehead and a red cross earring. She is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5450 works as a lawyer and has a reputation for being very empathetic and compassionate. This can lead to her taking on other people's problems as her own, making her feel responsible for fixing everything and everyone around her. This trait is both admirable and exhausting for SCP-5450.

SCP-5450 has demonstrated no anomalous abilities or effects, but her susceptibility to taking on the problems of others can be problematic if not properly managed. Due to her profession, there is a high risk of SCP-5450 encountering individuals with anomalous properties or abilities. Therefore, she should be closely monitored and kept within the facility for her own safety.

SCP-5450 has proven to be cooperative and understanding during her time in containment. She is allowed to continue practicing law within the facility to maintain her sense of purpose and normalcy. However, therapy sessions will continue to be required to manage her emotional state and ensure that she does not become a danger to herself or others.
