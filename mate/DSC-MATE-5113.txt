Item #: 5113

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5113 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a firefighter. Any abnormal behavior or signs of supernatural abilities must be reported immediately to Foundation personnel. Subject 5113 is not to be exposed to any anomalous objects or entities without prior approval from the Foundation.

Description: Subject 5113 appears to be a humanoid male in his mid-30s, with distinctive orange stripes across his face. He wears normal glasses over his eyes and has a metallic purple head, with a goggle always resting on his forehead. A gold earring is visible on his right ear, and he often wears a red scarf around his neck, presumably for fashion purposes. His mouth is always covered with a medical mask.

Subject 5113 is a highly motivated individual, known for being goal-oriented and ambitious in his personal and professional life. He possesses strategic thinking skills and excellent organizational abilities, which allows him to take on more than he can handle at times. Despite this, he manages to handle his duties effectively, which highlights his resilience under pressure.

It is uncertain if subject 5113 has any anomalous properties, but he must be considered a potential threat until further notice. As a precaution, he must adhere to strict containment protocols while on duty, and Foundation personnel must be on standby in case of unexpected events. Any changes in his behavior or any signs of paranormal abilities must be observed and reported immediately.

Addendum: Subject 5113 recently participated in a firefight that involved a burning building with strong anomalous energy. During his rescue efforts inside the building, he displayed abnormal strength and agility beyond what would be expected of a normal human. As such, further testing will be required to fully understand his capabilities.
