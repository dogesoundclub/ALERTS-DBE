Item #: SCP-7889

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7889 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. It is not to be allowed access to any electrical appliances or equipment without explicit approval from Level 3 personnel, as its reckless behavior may cause unintentional damage to Foundation property. SCP-7889 is to be closely monitored for any signs of malfunction or deviation from its programmed behavior.

Description: SCP-7889 is a male robot of unknown origin, appearing to be of humanoid design. Its head is adorned with a purple cap and headset, as well as a goggle on its forehead. Its eyes are obscured by normal glasses. SCP-7889's ears are fitted with a gold earring. Its overall appearance is that of an eccentric electrician.

SCP-7889's personality is characterized as reckless and impulsive, with a tendency to act before thinking things through. This often leads to comical mishaps and minor accidents, particularly when it tries to impress others. In addition, SCP-7889 shows high proficiency in electrical engineering and maintenance, making it a valuable asset for the Foundation when utilized properly.

SCP-7889 has been observed to be resistant to physical harm and destabilization, suggesting significant amounts of anomalous technology within its construction. Its anomalous nature and lack of cooperative behavior have made it difficult to study, but its usefulness in electrical tasks has earned it a position within the Foundation.
