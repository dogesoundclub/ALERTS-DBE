Item #: SCP-3874

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3874 is to be monitored remotely through security cameras at all times. Due to the nature of SCP-3874's abilities, it is required to make sure that it is not put in situations that could expose its anomalous traits. SCP-3874 is allowed a limited amount of movement within the city, but is prohibited from leaving designated delivery routes. SCP-3874 is to be provided with appropriate protective gear, such as a normal gas mask, during deliveries. Any deviations from the routine must be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-3874 is a male human of average height and weight, with distinctive facial features that include a mouth spot and frightened mouth. SCP-3874's eyes appear to be ski goggles, while its head has a monk-like appearance. SCP-3874 also has jade earrings and can often be seen wearing a red scarf as well. SCP-3874's personality is energetic and enthusiastic, with a tendency to become overly excited about things that others may not find as interesting. It works as a delivery driver for a local company and has shown no difficulty in performing its duties.

SCP-3874's anomalous abilities manifest when it becomes frightened or threatened. In these situations, SCP-3874 has displayed the ability to transport itself and any objects in its immediate vicinity to a different location within the city. This ability activates randomly and has no known limit. SCP-3874's ability to affect its environment in this way is poorly understood, and further research is required.

Addendum: SCP-3874 has been successfully contained with no known breaches to date. Testing to determine the extent of SCP-3874's teleportation ability is currently ongoing.
