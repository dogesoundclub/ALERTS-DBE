Item #: 3302

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Currently, the subject (hereafter designated as 3302) has been employed as a car salesman at [REDACTED] dealership, and as such, no efforts at containment are necessary. However, any interaction with 3302 should be closely monitored and approved by Foundation personnel with level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: 3302 is a male tiger, approximately 2 meters in height, with ski goggle-shaped eyes which glow red in low-light conditions. Their head is not arranged in a typical tiger manner, displaying a distinct green hue, and bearing a goggle on their forehead. 3302's ears are modified with a red cross earring, and they have a medical mask covering their mouth, ostensibly to protect their colleagues and clients from any possible infection. While not wearing a suit, 3302 can be seen wearing a silver chain around their neck.

Personality: 3302's most prominent characteristic is a strong attention to detail, often bordering on obsession. They display a preference for structure and order, with habits such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet. Despite being approachable, affable, and intelligent, any perceived deviation from their standards can cause a marked behavioral shift, typically resulting in increased irritability or aggression.

Notes: It is urged that personnel exercise caution while dealing with 3302, as while they have not shown any direct malevolent behavior, they might react negatively to perceived triggering stimuli. In the event of any unusual activity from 3302, they should be detained and monitored until cleared by level 4 personnel.
