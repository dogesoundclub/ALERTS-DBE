Item #: DSC-MATE-1088

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1088 must be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced walls and a steel door. This containment cell is to be monitored on a 24/7 basis by at least two armed guards with appropriate equipment to defend themselves against the DSC-MATE-1088's abilities.

Description: DSC-MATE-1088 is a male tiger that works as a car salesman in the city of ███████. They stand at 6 feet 5 inches tall and weigh approximately 350 lbs. DSC-MATE-1088's most distinctive facial feature is its frightened mouth layout, which causes them to look distressed most of the time. DSC-MATE-1088 also wears normal glasses and a blue bandana on their head, with goggles on their forehead and a jade earring on each ear. They wear a gold chain as an accessory, and an LED gas mask to conceal their face.

DSC-MATE-1088's personality is unique, as they exhibit a thirst for knowledge and enjoy researching and reading about obscure topics. DSC-MATE-1088 is constantly hungry for information and enjoys pursuing knowledge and wisdom. They often become obsessed with the information they collect and display a passion for sharing their newfound knowledge with others. This characteristic is a significant asset for the Foundation, as DSC-MATE-1088 is willing to provide information in exchange for the freedom to continue its research.

DSC-MATE-1088 possesses the ability to pacify or enrage its prey by use of pheromones. These pheromones have an effect on the prey's mood, making them more or less susceptible to being persuaded by DSC-MATE-1088. DSC-MATE-1088 can also control the movements of those under its influence before finally consuming them.

DSC-MATE-1088 must not be allowed into the public domain, as its abilities could pose an enormous hazard, and the risk of containment failure is high. Should there be any attempts to breach containment, the assigned guards have been instructed to use deadly force as a last resort.
