Item #: 4881

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4881 is to remain employed as a security guard at Site-██ for as long as they remain willing and able to do so. In the event of an emergency, DSC-MATE-4881 is authorized to take whatever actions they deem necessary to protect Site-██ and its personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-4881 is a human female with blue clown eyes and spotted skin. They have green hair styled in a purple cap, and wear a pair of goggles on their forehead. DSC-MATE-4881's most notable feature, aside from their appearance, is their practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving. They have a tendency to fix things in unconventional ways using everyday materials like duct tape and paper clips.

While not explicitly anomalous, DSC-MATE-4881's unique problem-solving abilities have proven useful in several situations. In one instance, Site-██'s security system malfunctioned during a containment breach. DSC-MATE-4881 was able to use their knowledge of electronics to temporarily bypass the system and reroute power to critical areas.

DSC-MATE-4881 is highly regarded by their fellow security personnel and is often called upon to fix or modify equipment as needed. They are sociable and enjoy interacting with their coworkers, but have a low tolerance for foolishness and can become short-tempered with those who waste their time.

DSC-MATE-4881 has expressed a desire to share their skills with other members of Site-██'s staff and has been approved to conduct training sessions on basic electronics and problem-solving techniques. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-4881 to share information beyond the scope of their authorized training is to be reported immediately to Site-██'s security department.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4881 has successfully repaired and maintained several items and devices around Site-██. These include, but are not limited to: the air conditioning system, the on-site generators, and DSC-████. Requests to have DSC-MATE-4881 temporarily transferred to other sites for repair and maintenance purposes have been submitted and are awaiting approval.
