Item #: SCP-5141

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5141 is currently employed by the local police department on a part-time basis. His hours are to be strictly monitored and his access to classified information limited. Should SCP-5141 display any signs of aggression or hostility towards humans or other SCPs, he is to be detained and relocated to a more secure facility.

Description: SCP-5141 is a male tiger in his early 30s, standing at approximately 1.9 meters tall and weighing approximately 190 kilograms. He wears a purple cap with a headset and a red cross earring in his left ear. At all times, SCP-5141 covers his mouth with a medical mask.

SCP-5141 displays a typically reserved and stoic demeanor but can surprise others with his dry sense of humor. His deadpan delivery has been noted to catch people off guard and often elicits laughter even in high-stress situations.

SCP-5141 also displays a marked tendency towards anxiety and fear, which is reflected in the often-frightened expression of his mouth.

Due to SCP-5141's status as a police officer, much of his activities are beyond the jurisdiction of the Foundation. However, given his anomalous nature and public-facing role, continuous monitoring is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of the public and the SCP community.
