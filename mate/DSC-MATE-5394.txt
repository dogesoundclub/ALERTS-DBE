Item #: SCP-5394

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5394 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Access to SCP-5394 is restricted to level 2 personnel and above. Any contact with SCP-5394 should be made with caution and only with proper authorization. 

Description: SCP-5394 is a female humanoid of average height and weight. SCP-5394 has a pink rabbit head with spots on its face, and purple lips. A pair of goggles is consistently seen resting on its forehead. It is capable of locomotion and speech which allowed interactions between itself and the Foundation's personnel. SCP-5394's profession is a mechanic, though the circumstances surrounding its imprisonment by the Foundation are unknown.

SCP-5394 is, in essence, a control freak seemingly dedicated to achieving maximum efficiency in every aspect of her existence. This obsessive-compulsive behavior has manifested itself in SCP-5394's work as a mechanic or otherwise. It is capable of taking charge of any available task, delegating assignments in a no-nonsense manner akin to an experienced manager. SCP-5394's efficiency is commendable and admirable, but its controlling personality may lead to humorous misunderstandings and occasionally intense interpersonal conflict. Despite being a part of a shared research and development environment, SCP-5394 prefers to perform tasks alone, citing personal preference or a lack of trust in others' abilities, which limits its cooperation with other members of the team.

Addendum: Following Incident 5394-A, SCP-5394 has been observed experiencing severe mood swings, often veering from high levels of productivity to depression within short periods. It had been suggested that SCP-5394 undergoes additional psychological evaluation and receive counseling if necessary, pending further observation to assess the stability of SCP-5394's mental state.
