Item #: 5604

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5604 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a small adjoining recreation room for leisure. Due to the subject's occupation as a firefighter, they are allowed temporary release from containment in the case of emergencies within their jurisdiction.

Description: Subject 5604 is a human female, standing at approximately 5'8" in height. One notable physical characteristic is the presence of spots on the subject's skin, varying in size and placement across the body. The subject's head is often adorned with accessories commonly associated with the Rainbow Festival, including vibrant hair accessories and a face painted with vivid colors. Subject 5604 also sports a green cross earring on one ear, complemented by a silver chain around the neck. Their eyes, while naturally blue, appear much larger and almost clown-like in appearance, often drawing attention.

Subject 5604 has proven to possess a strong sense of duty and responsibility, likely stemming from their occupation as a firefighter. Despite this serious nature, the subject is also known to let loose and have fun, often surprising others with their impressive dance moves or humorous antics at social events. These conflicting personality traits have led to difficulties in predicting the subject's behavior in certain situations, contributing to their classification as Euclid.

Addendum: Subject 5604 was brought to our attention after a series of reports were made regarding a "rainbow firefighter" attending local festivals and events, sometimes while still in uniform. Further investigation revealed the subject's anomalous abilities and behaviors, prompting SCP involvement.
