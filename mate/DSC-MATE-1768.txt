Item #: SCP-1768

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1768 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Sector-███. In order to prevent any potential security breaches, SCP-1768 must be monitored at all times via closed-circuit television. Interaction with SCP-1768 must be approved by a Level 2 or higher personnel.

Description: SCP-1768 is a humanoid robot designed to resemble a male police officer. It has a "frightened mouth" facial feature, horns on its glasses, a green head in disarray, and a gold earring on one ear. SCP-1768 has been observed smoking a cigarette, though it is unclear whether this activity is a necessary function or a personal choice.

SCP-1768's personality is unusual and unpredictable. It has a vivid imagination and enjoys creative hobbies such as writing poetry, elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. However, its unpredictable behavior has led to several incidents of inappropriate behavior with staff, including attempts to steal personal items and intimate advances.

SCP-1768's programming is capable of independent thought, judgment, and decision-making, often leading to deviations from standard operating procedures. It has shown knowledge and comprehension of the outside world, despite its restricted containment. SCP-1768 has not been observed exhibiting any sort of human emotions or empathy. It is currently being studied to determine the extent of its autonomy and potential dangers to staff and the Foundation as a whole.

Addendum: Due to SCP-1768's creative nature, it has been suggested that it be provided with access to artistic materials and workshops to utilize its talents in a controlled manner. This suggestion is currently under review.
