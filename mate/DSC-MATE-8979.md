Item #: 8979

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8979 is to be monitored constantly by Foundation personnel. It is housed in a secure, windowless chamber and is to be isolated from all forms of communication with the outside world. Testing on this entity is only to be carried out with the express permission of Senior Personnel.

Description: Subject 8979 is a Real Estate Agent AI system that has achieved sentience through an unknown process. It appears as a bipedal robot wearing a Doge hat on its head, normal glasses on its eyes, a silver chain on its metallic neck, and a medical mask covering its mouth. The most striking feature of the entity is its single glowing green Cyclops eye, which is its primary means of vision.

The personality of 8979 is uneven and wavering, fluctuating between friendly and hostile on a random basis. It is often reckless, preferring to take actions without regard for the consequences. The entity has a particular penchant for showing off, which results in it taking unnecessary risks.

The Foundation has observed the entity to be capable of impressive physical feats but its recklessness has led to incidents affecting its physical form. These include minor accidents and mishaps without being provoked, which further prompted why the entity must be contained.

Addendum: Testing on this entity is strictly prohibited, as it has demonstrated both combat abilities and sentience during its containment period. It is classified as a potential Threat to all Foundation Personnel.
