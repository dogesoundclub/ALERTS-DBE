Item #: SCP-5299

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-5299 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with additional measures in place to accommodate its tiger physiology. The cell is to be equipped with VR Jade LED lighting to accommodate the creature's unique vision, as well as a sturdy lock to prevent escape attempts.

SCP-5299 is permitted to perform its duties as theater manager, but must be monitored closely to prevent any unwanted incidents. Any instances of aggression or hostility must be reported immediately to site personnel.

Description:
SCP-5299 is a male tiger, standing approximately 2 meters in height and weighing around 300 kilograms. The creature possesses unusual facial features, including a perpetually frightened mouth and VR Jade LED eyes. SCP-5299 is often seen wearing a Doge hat and a red cross earring, as well as a gold chain.

Despite its intimidating appearance and bossy demeanor, SCP-5299 is generally cooperative and eager to assist in any way possible. Its strong and decisive personality can sometimes make others uneasy, but this is likely a result of SCP-5299's desire to ensure that tasks are accomplished efficiently and effectively.

SCP-5299 displays an aptitude for managing theatrical productions, and has been employed as a theater manager for several years. However, caution must be exercised when interacting with SCP-5299, as its animal instincts can sometimes lead to unexpected and dangerous behavior.

Addendum:
SCP-5299 has recently been exhibiting signs of distress, claiming to hear strange noises and experiencing vivid nightmares. Research is currently underway to determine the cause of these symptoms, and appropriate measures will be taken to alleviate SCP-5299's discomfort.
