Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5099 is to be allowed to continue working as a police officer with no restrictions, as long as he does not abuse his position of authority or use his anomalous properties for personal gain. All instances of DSC-MATE-5099's gas mask are to be stored in a secure locker, only to be used during authorized experiments.

Description: DSC-MATE-5099 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species, with orange stripes that cover his face. He is often seen wearing a retro cap on his head and a silver chain around his neck. He has two color bands on his forehead, along with a green cross earring on each ear. On his forehead, he also keeps a pair of goggles, which do not appear to serve any practical purpose.

DSC-MATE-5099's anomalous properties are centered around his ability to create a unique gas that when inhaled, induces fits of uncontrollable laughter in the victim. This gas is produced by the LED gas mask that DSC-MATE-5099 wears, and the exact process by which it is created is still unknown.

DSC-MATE-5099 is a charismatic and outgoing individual with a great sense of humor, and he enjoys making others laugh. However, he has been known to use his anomalous properties to his advantage in situations that require stealth or deception. He has been advised against such behavior, as it has the potential to compromise the secrecy of the Foundation's existence.

Addendum: During an unauthorized experiment, DSC-MATE-5099 was exposed to a large dose of his own gas, resulting in a prolonged period of convulsive laughter. It was during this incident that DSC-MATE-5099 discovered the extent of his control over the gas, as he was able to direct its effects towards certain individuals while maintaining his composure. Further research into this aspect of DSC-MATE-5099's abilities is ongoing.
