Item #: DSC-MATE-1894

Object Class: Euclid


Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1894 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any requests for assistance made by DSC-MATE-1894 must be monitored and approved by at least one Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-1894 is not to be allowed access to any medical supplies, veterinary or otherwise, without prior approval due to its profession. 

Description: DSC-MATE-1894 is a human female with distinct appearance and personality traits. Its facial features consist of orange stripes and a permanent smile. DSC-MATE-1894's head is green with edge curls and a two-colored band on its forehead. Furthermore, DSC-MATE-1894 is always seen wearing an LED gas mask, which is suggested to be self-designed. 

DSC-MATE-1894 is a veterinarian by profession and possesses a strong sense of independence. It has been observed to be reluctant to ask for help, even in times of need. This behaviour has been documented in DSC-MATE-1894 attempting to move heavy objects by itself or stubbornly refusing to use maps when lost. Its actions could escalate to the point of making detrimental decisions for its own safety.

DSC-MATE-1894 has a noticeable fascination towards treating mythical creatures that it perceives as injured or sick, despite the lack of evidence proving the existence of such creatures. This tendency is to be monitored carefully, as it could lead to a breach and an increased risk of public exposure to abnormal creatures.

DSC-MATE-1894 was located in a small town outside █████████, where it practised veterinary medicine for eight years before being successfully contained by Foundation personnel under the guise of a city health inspection. Any statements it has made about abilities or creatures, have thus far been taken as delusional or false.

Addendum: Over five years of containment, it has been noted that DSC-MATE-1894 displays behaviours similar to an Epsilon class Amnestic resistance. Research into the effects of DSC-MATE-1894 on this property is currently ongoing.
