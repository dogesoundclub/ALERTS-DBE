Item #: SCP-7992

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7992 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with appropriate tiger accommodations. SCP-7992 is to be provided veterinary care by qualified personnel, and provided with standard vegetarian food. Any instances of SCP-7992 attempting to protest or boycott within Site-██ are to be immediately reported to Security.

Description: SCP-7992 is a male Bengal tiger that exhibits an idealistic personality. SCP-7992 was discovered working at a fast-food restaurant in [REDACTED], wearing a blue bandana, medical mask, and normal glasses. SCP-7992 always wears a red scarf, and a red cross earring, which is surgically fused into its left ear.

SCP-7992 has a strong desire to make the world a better place, and constantly engages in humorous situations such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that it feels goes against its values. SCP-7992's ideology is mainly influenced by popular social movements such as veganism, climate change, and social justice.

SCP-7992 has been observed attempting to convert coworkers, and occasional customers to its ideals, and urging the restaurant to only serve vegetarian food, which conflicts with its role as a fast-food worker. Despite the comical nature of SCP-7992's ideological pursuits, personnel are warned not to engage SCP-7992 in debates, as it has been known to become aggressive when challenged.
