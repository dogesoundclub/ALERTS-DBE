Description: SCP-5164 appears to be a human male in his mid-twenties, with a frightened mouth and normal glasses. SCP-5164 typically wears a blue bandana on his head, a jade earring in his ear, a gold chain around his neck, and an LED gas mask as an accessory. Despite the unusual appearance, SCP-5164 appears to be capable of functioning in society unnoticed.

According to reports, SCP-5164 works as a fast food worker and displays an ambitious and goal-oriented personality. This often leads to SCP-5164 taking on more than he can handle, but he manages to strategize and organize his actions to accomplish his tasks.

Addendum: SCP-5164 has shown no signs of anomalous behavior thus far, but it is important to monitor and study SCP-5164's behavior to ensure no threats to society and anomaly containment.
