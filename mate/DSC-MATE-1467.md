Item #: 1467

Object Class: Euclid

Description: DSC-MATE-1467 is a female human politician of average height and weight. Although she appears to be a normal human being, she possesses unusual physical features. Her lips are a vivid shade of purple, and she has blue clown eyes that are often very expressive. Perhaps the most unusual feature of DSC-MATE-1467's appearance is the large pink rabbit head she wears at all times. The head is completely opaque and covers her entire head, save for her face.

DSC-MATE-1467 is commonly seen wearing a choker and holding a cigarette, which may serve as a stress reliever or act as a security blanket. DSC-MATE-1467 is a complex individual with an interesting dichotomy of personality traits. She is a politician and, as such, has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, she also possesses a sense of humor and loves to have fun. This leads her to engage in activities that may seem out of character for a politician, such as spontaneous dancing or singing.

Despite her lively personality, DSC-MATE-1467 can be guarded and is often evasive when it comes to personal matters. It is unknown whether this is a product of her profession or a personality trait. DSC-MATE-1467 is generally well-liked by those around her, which has led to her having a wide circle of influence.

Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1467 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to the nature of DSC-MATE-1467's appearance, any individuals approaching DSC-MATE-1467 in their workplace should be briefed on how to interact with her appropriately. DSC-MATE-1467 is allowed to engage in political activities under close observation by Foundation personnel. Any attempts to harm or exploit DSC-MATE-1467 must be prevented at all costs.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1467's political actions have led to the creation of legislation that benefits the Foundation greatly. DSC-MATE-1467 has been granted security clearance and has access to confidential information related to the Foundation. However, despite this access, DSC-MATE-1467's motives and true allegiance remain uncertain. Foundation personnel are encouraged to keep a close eye on her behavior and maintain a detailed log of her activities.
