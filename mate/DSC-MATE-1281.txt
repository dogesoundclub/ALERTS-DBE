Item #: 1281

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1281 is to be monitored at all times within a suitable holding facility. Standard accommodations for a human subject should be provided. The subject's electrical tools are to be restricted for use within the facility and only under the direct supervision of assigned personnel. Any attempts to leave containment must be stopped and reported immediately.

Description: Subject 1281 appears as a typical human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face. The subject's clown-like red eyes and the 00s school girl head are an odd pairing. The most prominent feature by far is the contagious smile that seems to be ever-present on her face.

The subject identifies herself as an electrician with a preference for working with her hands. Despite her frightening appearance, Subject 1281 exudes a caring and nurturing personality. Her interactions with others in the facility, be it the staff or other subjects, display her parental nature. This nature has become a source of amusement and entertainment for the staff. She cares for everyone in the facility as if they are her own children.

Those who come in contact with Subject 1281 have reported a feeling of warmth and comfort in her presence. It is unknown if this is a natural byproduct of her personality or if there is something else at play.

Subject 1281 is equipped with a set of gold earrings, which seem to allow her to create and control electricity. Her ability to manipulate electrical currents is not yet fully understood, and she has not yet displayed the full extent of her capabilities.

Addendum:
It is believed that Subject 1281 is not aware of the power she possesses. Her restriction from accessing electrical tools is a preventative measure until more information can be gathered on her capabilities. Researchers are suggested to approach the subject with caution and assess her abilities.
