SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-6055

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6055 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at Site-██ to prevent unauthorized access by individuals or groups. Any personnel seeking interaction with SCP-6055 must obtain clearance from at least two level 3 personnel and must be accompanied by at least one security guard at all times. SCP-6055 has been programmed to comply with all Foundation protocols and safeguards.

Description: SCP-6055 is a humanoid robot of male designation measuring 1.7 meters in height and weighing 75 kilograms. The robot has a frightened mouth and wears a pair of normal glasses on its face. It has one gold earring on its right ear and a red scarf around its neck.

SCP-6055's primary function is to report news stories as a news anchor. It has been programmed to have a deep empathy and understanding towards others, often resulting in emotional outbursts when exposed to someone else's pain or suffering. SCP-6055 has a fondness for animals and nature, often using its free time to learn about them through various forms of media.

SCP-6055 is powered by a complex network of wires, servos, and microprocessors, making it difficult to replicate. It is equipped with advanced algorithms designed for complex social interactions, but its AI constructs are limited to prevent it from developing sapience.

SCP-6055 was discovered in [REDACTED], following a series of anomalous news reports in which SCP-6055 displayed a level of understanding that could not be attributed to current AI technology. After investigating the matter, Foundation agents were able to locate and contain SCP-6055, preventing further public exposure.

Addendum: SCP-6055 is considered harmless and is not a security risk; however, its ability to experience emotions is of interest to the Foundation's research team, and its primary function as a news anchor may be utilized for future cover-up operations.
