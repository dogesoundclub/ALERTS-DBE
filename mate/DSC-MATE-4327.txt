Item #: SCP-4327

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4327 is to be monitored at all times while performing her duties as a delivery driver. She is to be equipped with a tracking device and must check in with her supervisor every hour. In the event that SCP-4327 goes missing, a search party is to be dispatched immediately. SCP-4327 is not to be allowed to interact with any other SCP entities unless given express permission by O5 council.

Description: SCP-4327 is a human female who works as a delivery driver for a local courier service. SCP-4327 is identifiable by her distinctive physical characteristics, which include purple spots on her face, a purple lip, and orange eyebrows. SCP-4327 is known to wear a green hair in a purple cap and a two-color band on her forehead, as well as carrying a cigarette at all times.

SCP-4327 appears to have a very introspective personality, often lost in thought or daydreaming while on the job. This can lead to humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought. However, there have been instances of SCP-4327 displaying dangerous behavior when under extreme stress, including irrational outbursts and violence.

SCP-4327's anomalous properties appear to be focused on her delivery van, which has been observed to disappear and reappear in different locations while on the job. Witnesses report seeing the van flicker in and out of existence before disappearing completely. SCP-4327 has shown no knowledge of this phenomenon and is unable to explain the disappearances.

Addendum: Investigation into SCP-4327's history has revealed that she was previously employed as a truck driver for a shipping company, but was terminated after an incident in which her truck disappeared and reappeared in a different location. SCP-4327 has no memory of this event and denies any involvement. Further investigation is ongoing.
