Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9099 is to be constantly monitored by Foundation agents to prevent any unauthorized access to sensitive government information. Due to the subject's persuasive personality, it is advised that any personnel who interact with 9099 ensure that they possess a strong sense of self and are not easily swayed by charm or charisma.

Description: Subject 9099 appears to be a human male of average height and build. The subject's most distinct facial features are a series of spots that cover the skin around their nose and mouth, and a perpetually present smile that seems to be simultaneously welcoming and a little bit sinister. The subject's eyes are covered by ski goggles, which could be used as a means to hide any emotional tells during negotiations. 9099 often wears a hoodie over their head and adorn themselves with a gold chain and carries a candy stick.

Personality: 9099 is a politician, well-known for their sharp wit and tactical mind. The subject is highly analytical and logical, and enjoys debating or arguing with others for fun. However, this can lead to some humorous situations, such as getting into a heated debate about a topic that others find trivial or unimportant. Subject 9099 is known for their persuasive abilities, often convincing others to do their bidding through a combination of charm, flattery, and carefully chosen words. Despite appearing to be friendly and approachable, there is an underlying sense of danger to the subject, and it is recommended that any interactions with them be handled with caution.
