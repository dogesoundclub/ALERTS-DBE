Item #: DSC-MATE-1569

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1569 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment module, reinforced with electrical insulation. The module is to be equipped with a power supply capable of meeting DSC-MATE-1569's energy requirements. At no time are any electrical tools or equipment permitted within DSC-MATE-1569's containment module.

DSC-MATE-1569 is to be monitored at all times by no fewer than two Level 2 personnel, trained in handling anomalous primates. In the event of a breach, personnel must exercise caution and avoid engaging DSC-MATE-1569 directly. Instead, attempts should be made to lure DSC-MATE-1569 back into containment with bait, such as his favorite fruits.

Description: DSC-MATE-1569 is a male monkey of unknown species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighing 24 kilograms. DSC-MATE-1569's most distinctive feature is his ski goggle eyes, which have been surgically implanted to protect his vision from electrical discharge. DSC-MATE-1569's head is naturally parted pink and he has jade earrings piercing both ears.

DSC-MATE-1569 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate and control electricity. He is capable of generating and discharging electrical currents with ease, causing blackouts or electrical surges in nearby areas. In addition, DSC-MATE-1569 has been observed using electrical wire and equipment as tools and weapons which makes him a significant hazard to personnel and infrastructure.

DSC-MATE-1569 is employed as a specialist electrician, and displays an advanced understanding of electrical wiring and theory, even without access to additional resources or information.

Personality: DSC-MATE-1569 displays a high degree of intelligence and pragmatism. They can be a bit impulsive and may have a tendency to act on their emotions rather than thinking things through, which makes them a wildcard in most situations. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as making spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising.

DSC-MATE-1569 also displays a deep concern for his own safety and well-being, as evidenced by his careful management of his electrical powers. DSC-MATE-1569 is not inherently violent, but may lash out if threatened or provoked.

Addendum: Note: DSC-MATE-1569 has been observed hiding and hoarding microprocessors, resistors, and other electrical components within its containment area, although their purpose remains unknown. Further research is needed to determine the exact nature and intent of these actions.
