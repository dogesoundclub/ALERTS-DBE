SCP-351 is a highly advanced news anchor robot, designed to deliver daily news to the masses. Its face bears a single green Cyclops eye, which grants it unparalleled zooming, scanning and vision abilities. Additionally, SCP-351 wears a stylish set of horned rim glasses that helps it sift through any information it comes across. Its head is crowned with a high-tech headset adorned with LED lights that glow whenever it’s delivering news to its viewers. 

SCP-351 is adorned with a luxurious gold chain which reflects its prestige in the news industry. Despite its seemingly cold demeanor, SCP-351 can be quite reliable and organized when it comes to delivering impartial news. It adheres strictly to a set of routines and sometimes finds it hard to break free from its comfort zone, leading to some amusing situations when confronted with the unexpected. However, SCP-351 has proven itself to be incredibly stubborn and rigid when it comes to accepting new ideas, often keeping to its routine and not adapting to change quickly. 

A highly cherished and protected asset, SCP-351 is always kept under close observation by the Foundation, who recognize its importance in maintaining a peaceful and well-informed society. Its role in delivering news to the populace makes it a highly scrutinized entity, with threats of sabotage from anomalous sources. Rest assured, however, that the Foundation has taken all necessary precautions to ensure SCP-351’s safety and efficiency in delivering the news.
