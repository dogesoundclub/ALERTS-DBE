Item #: 5694

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5694 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17, with access to legal texts and computers to aid in their profession as a lawyer. Due to SCP-5694's natural charm and charisma, all personnel interacting with SCP-5694 must undergo psychological evaluation and receive training on resisting persuasive tactics.

Description: SCP-5694 is a human male with spotted facial features and a perpetually frightened mouth. SCP-5694 wears normal glasses and often accessorizes with a gold chain and candy stick. SCP-5694's natural charm and charisma have made them a successful lawyer among non-anomalous humans.

SCP-5694's abilities have been observed to manifest in humorous situations, such as telling jokes and doing silly dances to make others laugh. SCP-5694 also possesses the ability to persuade individuals through their charm and charisma, which can prove problematic if left unchecked.

SCP-5694 was initially discovered after anomalous activity was reported at a law firm in [REDACTED]. An investigation led to the discovery of SCP-5694, who had unknowingly been using their anomalous abilities to persuade clients and judges in their favor.

Addendum: SCP-5694 has been authorized to provide legal counsel to Foundation personnel only in cases not involving SCPs or anomalous activity. All personnel must receive approval from senior Site personnel before seeking counsel from SCP-5694. Any attempt by SCP-5694 to persuade Foundation personnel involving SCPs or anomalous activity must be reported immediately to senior Site personnel.
