SCP-3693, also known as "The Fast Food Fixer," is a female human with unusual physical features. Her most noticeable trait is the orange stripes that run across her face, highlighted by her bright orange eyebrows. Her lips are a deep, vibrant red that contrasts sharply with her pale skin. The top of her head is adorned with various festival trinkets, giving her the appearance of a walking carnival. Her forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles, worn as a fashion statement rather than their intended purpose.

SCP-3693 is never seen without her signature accessories. Her attire includes a black choker that she wears tightly around her neck and a cigarette that is constantly smoldering between her fingers. She is often found behind the counter of a greasy spoon or some other fast-food establishment, wearing a dingy apron that is stained with a variety of condiments.

Despite her colorful appearance, SCP-3693 has a pragmatic and hands-on personality. She is often called upon to fix various machinery in the restaurant, and she always manages to find a unique solution to any problem. Her solutions may involve the liberal use of duct tape and bobby pins, but they are always effective. Her inventive nature has led to her being sought out by other SCP Foundation personnel for her problem-solving skills.

SCP-3693 tends to keep to herself, focusing on her work and her beloved accessories. However, when approached, she is friendly and approachable. Her casual demeanor and easy smile belie her intelligence and resourcefulness, and she has become a valuable asset to the Foundation.

Note: Personnel are forbidden from engaging in any romantic activity with SCP-3693 or providing her with cigarettes or any other harmful substances.
