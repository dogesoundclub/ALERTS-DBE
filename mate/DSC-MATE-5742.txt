Item #: 5742

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5742 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-5742 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any attempts to sway or manipulate SCP-5742 for personal gain are prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Description: SCP-5742 is a humanoid female identified as a real estate agent, with the appearance of blonde hair worn in a Ushanka, wearing green cross earrings, choker, and carrying a cigarette. The most notable feature of SCP-5742 is a series of orange stripes across her face, which is the origin of her nickname "Tabby."

SCP-5742 has demonstrated a personality trait of strong independence, often resistant to following strict protocols or perceived arbitrary rules. SCP-5742 has been observed as a rebellious agent, often seen sneaking out of the office early or taking unauthorized leave. SCP-5742's disregard for authority may place her into a problematic situation, causing potential danger to those around her.

Addendum: SCP-5742 demonstrated a unique ability to bargain with other SCP entities, offering services of finding appropriate living spaces to other sentient SCPs. SCP-5742 can access knowledge on safe and affordable housing in a discreet manner, allowing other sentient SCPs to keep a low profile within the human society. SCP-5742's willingness to work with other SCPs is an apparent violation of the Foundation's regulations, and the utilization of SCP-5742's skill set must be strictly monitored.
