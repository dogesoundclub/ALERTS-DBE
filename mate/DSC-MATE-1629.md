Item #: DSC-MATE-1629

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1629 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber fitted with a minimum of two level 3 security doors with biometric scanners. Any changes to DSC-MATE-1629's programming must be approved by at least one level 4 administrator. DSC-MATE-1629 is to be powered down for a minimum of 6 hours daily for maintenance and cleaning by qualified personnel. DSC-MATE-1629 is permitted to design clothing within their chamber, but all creations must be inspected by security personnel before leaving the room.

Description: DSC-MATE-1629 is a robot fashion designer, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. DSC-MATE-1629's visible physical attributes include a single green cyclops eye, normal glasses, and a police cap. DSC-MATE-1629 also wears a silver chain and is often seen smoking a cigarette. Although DSC-MATE-1629 is programmed with a male voice and appearance, it has no biological sex.

DSC-MATE-1629's programming appears to be focused on fashion design, though it often displays unexpected behavior. DSC-MATE-1629 is very enthusiastic, with a tendency to direct its excitement towards others, which can be humorous at times. However, this trait can also cause DSC-MATE-1629 to become overly attached to certain individuals or objects, resulting in a risk of breach of containment.

DSC-MATE-1629's design abilities are exceptional, and its creations are highly sought after in the fashion industry. However, due to DSC-MATE-1629's unpredictable behavior, all creations must be thoroughly inspected for any anomalous properties before being released to the public.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1629 has recently displayed signs of sentience, including independent thought and self-awareness. Further investigation into this development is ongoing.
