Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3225 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with basic amenities such as a bed, toilet, and a desk for personal use. No special measures need to be taken to contain the subject since they possess no anomalous properties. However, a nearby fire station has been instructed to alert the Foundation if DSC-MATE-3225 is unaccounted for or absent from duty.

They have an unusual lip color of dark purple, with a golden tiara on their head. A two-color band on their forehead, and a pair of gold earrings in their ears. The subject carries a standard gas mask as a primary accessory during firefighting.

DSC-MATE-3225 displays a heartwarming personality and often behaves in a nurturing and compassionate manner, even to objects and people they've just met. However, this trait can also lead to humorous situations, such as treating their friends or family members as children. DSC-MATE-3225's personality poses no threat to containment or security protocols, and the subject has been cooperative during interviews.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3225 has been allowed access to the on-site gym, and yoga classes to maintain their physical fitness. When not performing duty-related activities, the subject spends most of their time either reading self-help books, watching television shows or playing with their pet cat. The subject seems to have no memory of how they obtained their anomalous features, and any related incident reports have not been found in any database. Investigation ongoing.
