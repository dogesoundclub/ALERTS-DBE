Item #: DSC-MATE-979

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-979 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Standard human amenities are to be provided, including access to beauty products and salon equipment. Any personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-979 must be aware of her forgetful nature and adjust their expectations accordingly.

Description: DSC-MATE-979 is a female human beautician, standing at approximately 5'5". Her most notable feature is a pattern of spots covering her face, which she often accentuates with bright red lipstick. Her eyes are an unusual shade of orange, matching her eyebrow color. She often wears a rainbow-colored festival headband, and a pair of goggles rest on her forehead. DSC-MATE-979 also wears a distinctive red cross earring and a choker necklace.

DSC-MATE-979's personality is characterized by an absent-mindedness and forgetfulness that can lead to humorous situations. Despite this, she is skilled in her trade and has a talent for making her clients feel comfortable and confident in their appearance. While her forgetfulness can be frustrating to deal with, her upbeat and friendly demeanor makes her a popular member of the Foundation's staff.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-979's forgetfulness has made her a liability in certain circumstances. During a recent security breach, she forgot to lock her cell and wandered out into the hallway, completely unaware of the danger. As a result, a Level 2 Containment Breach was narrowly avoided. All personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-979 are reminded to be vigilant and take appropriate precautions to ensure her safety and the safety of those around her.
