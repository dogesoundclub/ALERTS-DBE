Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 3492, also known as "Jinx", is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a personal computer for recreational purposes. Jinx is to be provided a healthy diet and regular exercise to maintain his physical and mental well-being.

Personnel are advised to approach Jinx with caution as he may become easily startled and prone to fits of panic. Any interaction with him must be handled delicately to prevent any unnecessary alarms, resulting in unnecessary distress to both the subject and the containment team.

Description: Jinx is a male monkey, approximately 3 feet tall with a retro cap on his head and a gold chain around his neck. His eyes are a creepy red, similar to that of clown eyes, and his mouth is often found in a frightened position. Jinx also sports a jade earring on one of his ears and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

Jinx is a highly intelligent creature and works as a programmer. He is, however, easily distracted, and his attention span is comparable to that of a child. His scatterbrained nature leads him to forget essential appointments and obligations, often leading to comical situations.

Personnel must be aware that Jinx's monkey instincts may subconsciously manifest when triggered, causing him to behave erratically and unpredictably. It is highly recommended that personnel approach him with caution and utilize strict containment protocols at every interaction.

Addendum 3492-A: Jinx is highly skilled in computer programming, and his abilities have proved invaluable to the foundation. However, he is often uncooperative and prone to tantrums, leading to various attempts to persuade him to share his knowledge voluntarily. All offers have been met with failure, and any attempt to force him only results in misguided sparks.
