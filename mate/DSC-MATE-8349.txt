Description: SCP-8349, also known as "The Rabbit", is a male bipedal rabbit of unknown origin. SCP-8349 is approximately 1.2 m in height and has a distinctive ski goggle-like eye covering. Its head is adorned with a red beanie and its ears are pierced with green jade earrings. SCP-8349 sports a silver chain around its neck that appears to be embedded into its skin, making it impossible to remove. SCP-8349 is known to carry a whistle with it at all times.

SCP-8349's personality is highly erratic and unpredictable. It is prone to making impulsive decisions which often lead to dangerous situations. These spontaneous actions have caused SCP-8349 to become a notorious villain, who enjoys taking risks and engaging in criminal activities for entertainment purposes.

SCP-8349 has the ability to manipulate reality on a small scale to suit its own purposes, often using this ability to subdue victims or evade capture. Some of SCP-8349's abilities include phasing through physical objects, invisibility, and creating small pockets of reality that it can manipulate to its advantage.

Addendum: SCP-8349 has been identified as a significant threat to the Foundation, as it has repeatedly escaped confinement and caused significant damage to the surrounding area. SCP-8349 must be kept under maximum security at all times to prevent it from causing further harm.
