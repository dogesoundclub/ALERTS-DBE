Description: SCP-9896 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 30 cm in height. They display prominent brown fur with white patches around their eyes, paws, and mouth. Notably, they appear to be always frightened, the rabbit's mouth quivering in distress even when there is no apparent danger.

SCP-9896 is a practical and hands-on individual, often resorting to unconventional methods when dealing with issues. They have been observed utilizing duct tape or paper clips to fix objects and forming makeshift solutions towards complex problems. Nevertheless, SCP-9896 presents no threat.
