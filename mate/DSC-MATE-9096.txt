Item #: SCP-9096

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9096 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All personnel entering SCP-9096's cell must be approved by Level 3 personnel and wear earplugs in order to prevent hearing damage. SCP-9096 is allowed access to veterinary medical texts and tools for exploration purposes only.

Description: SCP-9096 is a female human who appears to be a veterinarian by profession. SCP-9096 has blue clown eyes, green hair under a purple cap, and a set of purple lips. On the forehead, SCP-9096 wears a two-color band and goggles. Around SCP-9096's neck is a choker.

SCP-9096 displays a strong sense of intuition and has been known to predict future events, making her seem to possess psychic abilities. SCP-9096 is also able to sense when other individuals are feeling upset or anxious, which can be disconcerting to some individuals.

SCP-9096 wears the goggles at all times, and their purpose is currently unknown. SCP-9096 has expressed discomfort when questioned about the purpose of the goggles and has refused to remove them.

SCP-9096 has never been observed to eat, sleep, or engage in other basic human activities; however, medical examination shows that SCP-9096 is physically healthy.

Addendum: While being observed, SCP-9096 received a phone call about a sick pet dog. SCP-9096 immediately disappeared from sight, and the pet dog was found to be completely cured shortly after. Further investigation showed that SCP-9096 used an unknown method to heal the animal.

SCP-9096's ability to heal animals is currently under further investigation.
