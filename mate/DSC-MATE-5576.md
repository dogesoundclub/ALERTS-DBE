Description: 
Subject 5576, also known as "Doctor Orange Stripes", is a human male with bright orange stripes on his face. His face feature #2 is a constantly present smile, exposing his set of blue clown eyes. His head is made of a metallic purple substance, and he wears an earring made of green jade with a gold chain as his accessory. 

Subject 5576 presents with a unique personality that can be endearing or frustrating depending on the situation. He enjoys brainstorming and often comes up with creative and outlandish ideas that are occasionally humorous, but can be impractical. Despite this quirk, subject 5576 has been known to provide valuable insights and solutions when it matters most.

Addendum 5576-1:
Subject 5576 was initially discovered by the Foundation when he entered a diner and demanded that all vegetable items on the menu be replaced with fruit. He then proceeded to explain to the patrons and staff that vegetables were the cause of all unhappiness in the world. Local law enforcement was called to the scene, and a cover-up story was put in place to explain the incident. Subject 5576 was eventually identified as a potential anomaly and taken into Foundation custody.

Addendum 5576-2:
Subject 5576 has cooperated with Foundation personnel and has provided useful information for the anomaly research team. Despite his quirks, he appears to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, and his containment status will remain unchanged.
