SCP-3025, designated as a train driver of the human species, is a unique case of an individual with a peculiar appearance. Though presenting with a benign smile and typical glasses, their head is that of a vibrant pink rabbit, with two color bands adorning their forehead and a green cross earring hanging from each ear. Accompanying their accessories is a captivating gold chain that drapes around their neck, often capturing the attention of those around them.

SCP-3025's personality is just as striking as their appearance, with a keen attention to detail that borders on an obsessive quality. Tasks as mundane as organizing their spice rack or closet are done with a meticulous standard that impresses even the most exacting of individuals. However, this detail-oriented tendency can manifest in unexpected ways, causing it to represent a potential risk to the surrounding populace.

These attributes make SCP-3025 an unusual but valuable asset to the Foundation, able to easily spot abnormalities and irregularities in their assigned tasks. As such, they are under careful observation to ensure that their meticulousness does not lead to unexpected consequences.
