Special Containment Procedures: Subject 737 is to be kept under close observation at all times, with weekly psychological evaluations conducted by Foundation personnel. Due to the potential risks associated with their reckless behavior, subject 737 is to be excluded from any field missions unless specifically authorized by the Site Director.

Description: Subject 737 is a female human with distinctive spots on their face. Their hair is styled in a "witch short" cut, and they wear a red cross earring on one ear. The most striking feature of subject 737 is their eyes, which are fitted with VR rainbow LED lenses that give the appearance of constantly shifting colors. They typically wear a medical mask over their mouth, which they claim is for protection against airborne pathogens but may also serve to hide any unusual dental features.

Subject 737 works as a veterinarian outside of Foundation duties, and displays extensive knowledge of both mundane and anomalous species. They are known to be skilled at animal handling and frequently interact with the animals in Foundation custody.

Despite their expertise in animal care, subject 737 has a noticeable tendency to act impulsively and disregard safety protocols. This has resulted in multiple incidents where subject 737 has endangered themselves or others in attempts to show off or impress others. Despite any potential consequences, subject 737 appears to derive pleasure from this behavior and may require additional counseling or therapy to address these issues. 

Additional Notes: Subject 737 is rarely seen without a silver chain necklace around their neck, which is suspected to have some personal significance. Further investigation is required to determine its significance and any potential anomalous properties.
