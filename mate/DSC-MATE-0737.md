Description: Subject 737 is a female human with distinctive spots on their face. Their hair is styled in a "witch short" cut, and they wear a red cross earring on one ear.

They typically wear a medical mask over their mouth, which they claim is for protection against airborne pathogens but may also serve to hide any unusual dental features.
