REPORT: SCP-9385

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:
SCP-9385 must be kept under constant surveillance and confined to a secure location with limited access. Any attempts to remove SCP-9385 from its designated location must receive approval from Site Director before proceeding. SCP-9385 is allowed to maintain contact with the outside world and engage in work-related activities, but all communication must be monitored for any possible breaches of Foundation security protocols.

DESCRIPTION:
SCP-9385 is a female humanoid with distinctive orange and red facial features. SCP-9385's orange eyebrows and orange side hair are particularly notable, as well as their bright red lipstick. SCP-9385 habitually smokes cigarettes, with the ash frequently escaping their hand and igniting nearby objects. SCP-9385's personality is characterized by a resistance to change and a strong adherence to routine, leading to some humorous interactions between SCP-9385 and Foundation personnel.

SCP-9385 is a talented programmer and is known for their reliability in completing tasks efficiently. However, their stubbornness can sometimes prevent them from considering alternative or innovative solutions to problems. SCP-9385 also has a tendency to procrastinate, leaving tasks until the last possible moment and causing unnecessary stress for themselves and others.

SCP-9385's capabilities and knowledge of modern technology make it a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, their nonchalant attitude towards security protocols can cause potential risks to the containment of SCPs. Therefore, SCP-9385's access to sensitive information is strictly monitored and restricted.

ADDENDUM:
SCP-9385 has been identified as a potential recruit for MTF Epsilon-6 due to their technical expertise, but further evaluation is required before any action can be taken.
