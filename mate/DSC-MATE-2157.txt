Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2157 is to be contained in a standard living quarters at Site-██. SCP-2157 is not to be allowed to leave the facility unless authorized and supervised. All visitors must undergo psychological evaluation and must be granted approval by at least two Level 4 personnel. SCP-2157's personal items, including their gold chain and candy sticks, are to be inspected on a regular basis and any anomalous effects registered. Any unauthorized individuals exhibiting effects of SCP-2157's anomalies are to be detained and examined immediately.

Description: SCP-2157 appears to be an average male human of approximately 25 years old. SCP-2157's face exhibits a prominent "mouth spot" that covers most of their lower lip. Despite this, they are able to speak, consume food and liquids, and make facial expressions. SCP-2157 displays a permanent and exaggerated "smile," in spite of the situation. SCP-2157's eyes resemble ski goggles and are always present regardless of the lighting conditions. It is currently unknown whether they are capable of any extra-sensory perception.

SCP-2157's head features a "peak spike" hairstyle that protrudes approximately 7 centimeters above their scalp, with a vibrant green hue. SCP-2157's ears are adorned with a single gold earring on their left earlobe.

SCP-2157 is a professional beautician with a nurturing personality. They are highly empathetic and have displayed the ability to feel other's feelings to an amplified degree. As a result, SCP-2157 is prone to taking on other's problems as their own, and will go above and beyond to help others at the expense of their own health, both physical and emotional.

SCP-2157's accessories include a gold chain that has the anomalous ability to "calm" those in close proximity to it. Currently, testing has revealed that the effects of the chain are temporary and cease once removed. SCP-2157's second accessory is a candy stick, which can be used to focus SCP-2157's powers of amplifying empathy to a specific individual or group of individuals. The effects of this candy stick are highly concentrated and can result in severe burnout if overused.

Addendum: SCP-2157 is highly cooperative with Foundation personnel and displays no indication of hostility or malicious intent. However, the potential for involuntary effects from their abilities poses significant risks to life and property that shouldn't be taken lightly. Testing and containment are ongoing.
