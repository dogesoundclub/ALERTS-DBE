Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 869, also known as "The Boss," is to be contained within a maximum-security facility at all times. Standard human containment protocols are to be upheld with additional measures to ensure the subject's communication devices are only accessible to personnel with proper clearance. All communication with the subject must be monitored to prevent any attempts at interference with Foundation resources or personnel. Interaction with the subject is only authorized for research or interviews by Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description:
Subject 869 is a human female of average build and height, with a distinct metallic blue head and jade earrings. The subject's eyes emit a VR rainbow LED light and they often cover their mouth with a medical mask. Their most noticeable feature is a constant smile on their face, which can be quite unnerving considering their status as a high-ranking mafia boss. Despite being human, the subject exhibits a level of ruthlessness and efficiency that makes them a formidable foe.

Personality:
Subject 869 is a strong and decisive leader, often exhibiting an intimidating demeanor when dealing with underlings or those who cross them. Their demeanor may come across as bossy and intimidating, but their approach is rooted in an unwavering desire for efficiency and effectiveness in all their dealings. They expect nothing less than excellence from those under their command, and they are not afraid to deal with failure in a harsh manner. Despite their brutal reputation, they can show a great deal of compassion to those who are loyal and deserving of their trust.

Additional Notes:
It is important to note that Subject 869 has shown a remarkable ability to manipulate and control those around them. Efforts must be made to keep the subject isolated to prevent them from establishing additional influence beyond their current criminal empire. Special attention should be given to any communications or dealings with the subject, as their influence can extend beyond their physical presence.
