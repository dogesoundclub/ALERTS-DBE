Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5465 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, equipped with reinforced steel walls and ceiling. DSC-MATE-5465 is not permitted to be in direct contact with any individuals not cleared by the Foundation.

Description: DSC-MATE-5465 is a male Tiger who manifests himself as a train driver. With its distinctive set of ski goggle eyes and a hooded head resembling a hoodie, DSC-MATE-5465 is easily identified. The entity always wears a red scarf and can often be spotted smoking a cigarette outside the train stations.

DSC-MATE-5465 exhibits a strong sense of independence and is resistant to authority or rules which it considers unnecessary. The entity's rebellious nature has caused DSC-MATE-5465 to exhibit erratic behavior, such as sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission. DSC-MATE-5465 shows an intense interest in the train cars it operates, visibly taking pride in its work.

DSC-MATE-5465 has demonstrated an unusual ability to manipulate the locomotives it operates, even to the point of emanating a force field around them. The physical mechanism behind this remains unknown. DSC-MATE-5465 has exhibited an acute sense of spatial awareness, navigating difficult and dangerous train routes with remarkable ease.

It should be noted that DSC-MATE-5465 has a tendency to engage in hostile behavior when its sense of independence is threatened. Use caution when approaching the entity.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5465 demonstrates remarkable abilities, and his independent nature only adds to his irreplaceability. We recommend that we explore harnessing these abilities for the DogeSoundClub's use.
