Item #: 1372

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1372 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to electronic devices is strictly forbidden, and all interactions with personnel are to be monitored. Subject 1372 is to be provided with a set of headphones and a selection of classical music to play at her discretion.

Description: Subject 1372 is a human female, aged 28 with an affinity for art, music, and emotional stimuli. Her most striking features are her purple lips, which contrast with her pale complexion, and her jade earrings in the shape of teardrops. She is often seen wearing a retro cap, which conceals her bright red hair, and goggles on her forehead. She also wears a black choker and tends to smoke cigarettes during moments of stress.

Subject 1372's emotional sensitivity is anomalous in nature, with her feelings manifesting in physical phenomena. Her proximity to machinery and electronic devices causes them to sputter or malfunction, leading to the conclusion that she is possessed of an electromagnetic field that interacts unpredictably with technology. Additionally, when experiencing strong emotional stimuli, subject 1372 is capable of affecting the emotional state of nearby individuals, leading to instances of uncontrollable sobbing, or conversely, elevated emotional states.

Addendum: The accuracy of subject 1372's emotional feedback is under scrutiny, with some researchers suggesting that the phenomena are a byproduct of her empathic abilities. Further experimentation is ongoing.
