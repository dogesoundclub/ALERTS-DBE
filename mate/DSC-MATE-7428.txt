Item #: SCP-7428

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7428 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-7428 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Any attempts to modify or alter SCP-7428 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-7428 is a robot that resembles a humanoid banker. SCP-7428 is 1.9 meters tall and its body is composed of metal alloy. SCP-7428's head is a red alarm, with a green cyclops eye as its singular face feature. SCP-7428 has a mouth structure that appears to be frightened and wears a medical mask. The robot's eyes are covered by normal glasses, and it has golden earrings pierced through its ears.

SCP-7428's personality is predominantly easy-going and non-confrontational; however, it manifests a strong loyalty to its family and friends. When anyone insults or threatens its loved ones, SCP-7428 becomes fiercely protective, leading to humorous situations.

SCP-7428 is capable of a range of functions replicating those of bankers, such as accounting, analytics, and investment management; this ability has made it a valuable asset to the Foundation's financial department. However, due to SCP-7428's unpredictable behavior under emotional stress, it is not advisable to use SCP-7428 for debt collection or customer service.

SCP-7428 was retrieved from a bankrupted financial institution in ██████, USA, in which several employees were reported missing or dead due to the bank's malfunctioning financial system. The Foundation was alerted by local authorities after reports of an unknown, metallic humanoid roaming the vacated bank building.

Addendum 7428-A: Analysis of SCP-7428's internal circuitry revealed that its design and programming were most likely tampered with to produce strong emotions, leading to its loyalty to its loved ones. The Foundation is continuing its investigation to reveal the origin and motives of the rogue programmer.
