Item #: SCP-2848

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2848 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with security measures suitable for its species. Its diet must consist of fresh meat and vegetables, and weekly visits from a zoologist are mandatory for its emotional and physical well-being. The red scarf and bucket hat must be kept in its cell at all times.

Description: SCP-2848 is a male tiger with an appearance resembling a human male in a dark blue suit. Its facial features include a scared mouth and opaque eyes. SCP-2848 is typically seen wearing a red scarf and a fuzzy bucket hat. It also has a habit of smoking cigarettes, providing free entertainment to those who accompany it.

SCP-2848 exhibits a strong preference for social connections and harmony. Its personable nature has the tendency to lead to playful banter with others, making it appear almost human-like at times. However, an underlying mischievous tendency must be noted, as it has been known to play pranks on staff members and other SCPs.

Addendum: SCP-2848 was discovered by Foundation agents attempting to assimilate into human society as a lawyer. It has extensive knowledge of the human legal system and exhibits unpredictably favorable results in court cases, making some speculate it as a possible reality bender. Further research and observation are required.
