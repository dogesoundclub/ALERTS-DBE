Item #: DSC-MATE-7996

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7996 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The walls of the chamber should be covered with sound-absorbing foam, as DSC-MATE-7996 tends to make loud vocalizations when agitated. The chamber should also be stocked with various puzzles and toys for DSC-MATE-7996 to keep itself occupied.

In addition to these standard containment procedures, DSC-MATE-7996 has been granted special permission to work as the manager of a local theater. Personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-7996 should monitor its behavior closely during working hours and ensure that it does not disclose the Foundation's existence to the public.

Description: DSC-MATE-7996 is a male monkey belonging to the species Macaca fascicularis. It stands approximately 1 meter tall and is adorned with a blue bandana and a gold earring. DSC-MATE-7996's eyes consist of a virtual rainbow LED display that changes color depending on its mood.

DSC-MATE-7996 is a reclusive individual who tends to spend the majority of its time lost in thought or daydreaming. This introspection has caused DSC-MATE-7996 to become somewhat clumsy, frequently walking into objects or tripping over its own feet.

DSC-MATE-7996 possesses the ability to communicate through a combination of sign language and vocalizations. The vocalizations are often loud and can range from playful screeches to anger-filled screams. DSC-MATE-7996 has also been seen carrying a whistle, which it uses to attract attention or signal for help.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7996 has exhibited a talent for managing and organizing events, particularly theatrical performances. This talent has led to the Foundation granting DSC-MATE-7996 a part-time job as the manager of a local theater. Despite initial concerns about security, DSC-MATE-7996 has thus far proven to be a reliable employee and has not revealed the existence of the Foundation to anyone.
