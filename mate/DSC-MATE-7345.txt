Item #: SCP-7345

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7345 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any communication with SCP-7345 must be conducted through a two-way intercom system with a delay of no less than 5 seconds. Physical contact with SCP-7345 is prohibited without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-7345 appears to be a female human of average height and build, with spots covering her facial features and a distinctive purple lipstick. SCP-7345 wears normal glasses, along with a headset with a LED display and a two-color band on her forehead. She is often seen wearing a choker and an LED gas mask.

SCP-7345 exhibits an extremely organized and efficient personality, often taking charge of group projects and delegating tasks in a matter-of-fact manner. This behavior can come across as controlling, which has led to humorous situations and misunderstandings in the past.

SCP-7345's primary occupation is that of a car salesman, and it is believed that she uses her organizational skills to excel in this profession. However, further investigation is needed to determine if SCP-7345's abilities extend beyond organizational talents, as she has been known to exhibit anomalous behavior.

Addendum: Incident Report 7345-01

On ██/██/████, SCP-7345 experienced an emotional outburst during a routine psychological evaluation, leading to the discovery of several anomalous abilities. SCP-7345 demonstrated heightened cognitive abilities, including the ability to read thoughts and predict future events with a high degree of accuracy.

As such, SCP-7345 has been reclassified as Euclid, and all further testing and containment measures have been updated accordingly.
