Item #: 7510

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7510 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell must be equipped with a computer and internet access, as SCP-7510 requires access to technology for work purposes. Any requests for additional technology must be reviewed and approved by assigned personnel.

Description: SCP-7510 is a female humanoid with distinctive orange stripes on their face. SCP-7510 also possesses orange eyebrow eyes and sports a purple cap with attached headset on their head, as well as a jade earring in either ear. SCP-7510's personality is highly detail-oriented, at times even obsessive, with color-coding their closet and alphabetizing their spice rack.

While SCP-7510's appearance is humanoid, it is important to note that they possess a heightened technological aptitude, holding the title of programmer in their former life. This skillset can manifest in unexpected ways, allowing SCP-7510 to manipulate technology beyond what would be expected of a human.

SCP-7510, when removed from their technological aptitude, experiences severe anxiety and possible panic attacks. It is important that SCP-7510 remains connected to their technological tools at all times, as it also provides the basis for their identity.

Addendum: SCP-7510's technological proficiency has been invaluable in assisting the foundation in analyzing and assessing various technological threats related to the supernatural. SCP-7510's assistance is to be maintained under careful supervision for their safety and the safety of the foundation.
