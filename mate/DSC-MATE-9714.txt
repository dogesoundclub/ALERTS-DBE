Item #: SCP-9714

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9714 is to be restricted to her assigned train and is not allowed to leave the designated routes outside of designated testing procedures. SCP-9714's train is to be monitored at all times for any suspicious behavior or passengers that may attempt to interfere with its operation. Any unauthorized access to SCP-9714 is to be met with immediate termination.

Description: SCP-9714 is a human female that works as a train driver. SCP-9714 is easily recognizable by her spots on her face and purple lips. SCP-9714's eyes appear to be a jade LED, and she wears her hair in two pigtail braids. She is known to wear a silver chain around her neck and a gas mask, which she claims to be "normal."

SCP-9714 displays an idealistic personality and a strong desire to make a better world. She has been observed protesting and boycotting companies and causes that do not align with her values. SCP-9714's idealism has caused several humorous situations that have interfered with her job. SCP-9714's belief in making the world a better place may be caused by her knowledge of SCP-███████.

SCP-9714 has displayed anomalous traits in the form of a resistance to anomalous effects throughout her work on Route ██████. She has also shown a tendency to make mechanical repairs to her train in a fraction of the normal repair time. The origin of these traits is unknown, but SCP-9714 has yet to receive any additional anomalous abilities.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-9714 encountered a passenger that made a strange deal with her. SCP-9714 has since acted more withdrawn, avoiding answering questions regarding the incident. Further investigation is underway.
