Item #: 5789

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5789 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced steel walls and equipped with a sound-proofing system. A diet of raw meat and water is to be provided daily, and any and all contact with SCP-5789 must be avoided at all costs. Personnel are urged to avoid making eye contact with SCP-5789 due to the psychotropic effects of its red clown eyes.

Description: SCP-5789 appears to be a male humanoid creature of the species Panthera Tigris with a distinctive green hair in purple cap on its head, adorned with a red victory band around its forehead. SCP-5789 also wears a silver chain around its neck. Its eyes appear to have a hypnotic effect, with red sclera matching its hair and pupils resembling the eyes of a clown.

SCP-5789's personality is that of a natural brainstormer, often coming up with new and creative ideas despite its containment. This can sometimes lead to outlandish solutions to problems, causing humorous situations during interviews with SCP-5789's designated researcher.

SCP-5789 was discovered working as a reporter for an urban newspaper, where its unique appearance and creative reporting style gained significant popularity. SCP Foundation agents intercepted and contained it after receiving reports of unusual behavior in SCP-5789's workplace.

SCP-5789's psychotropic effect on its eyes is still under investigation, and researchers are encouraged to approach the creature with extreme caution.

Note: Do not underestimate SCP-5789's abilities for their seemingly harmless appearance. Individuals are urged to report any unusual behavior or effects after exposure to SCP-5789 so that further understanding of this anomaly may be determined.
