Description:

DSC-MATE-8862 is a juvenile male monkey standing approximately 3 feet tall. Its eyes are blue clown eyes, and it wears a gold earring in one of its ears. It is also known to carry a candy stick at all times.

DSC-MATE-8862's demeanor is that of a Mafia Boss, exhibiting the traditional and no-nonsense attitude typical of organized crime. It values tradition and often tells jokes and stories passed down through its family or community.

DSC-MATE-8862 is capable of causing severe harm to any individual deemed to be a threat. It is often observed to behave playfully with a mischievous streak when interacting with its handlers, which has led to several incidents resulting in injury or harm.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-8862 was recovered from a boutique hotel in downtown Los Angeles after attacking several hotel patrons. It was captured after the local authorities were alerted to its presence. The Foundation's involvement was necessary due to DSC-MATE-8862's heightened aggression and naturally contagious tendencies, which posed a serious threat to public safety.

Several attempts to gain more information about DSC-MATE-8862's origins and capabilities have been made but have been unsuccessful thus far. The Foundation is encouraged to continue research and containment efforts aimed at minimizing any potential threat posed by DSC-MATE-8862.
