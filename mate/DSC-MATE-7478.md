DSC-MATE-7478 was first discovered in 20██ when it was located by Foundation agents during routine investigations of a local theater. DSC-MATE-7478 had been working as a theater manager for a public stage and had successfully hidden its anomalous properties from the public. After successfully recovering the anomaly, it was assigned to an DogeSoundClub containment facility.

DSC-MATE-7478’s behavior is typical to a strong, decisive, and effective leader. They can be bossy or intimidating when working with others, all due to a desire to maintain a high efficiency and productivity level. Despite their strong personality, DSC-MATE-7478 has shown to be of sound mind and generally cooperative with staff.


Addendum: Following the recovery of DSC-MATE-7478, it provided the Foundation with numerous leads on anomalous activity within the region surrounding its place of employment. Foundation agents have been dispatched to investigate these leads, leading to the successful containment of several additional anomalies. As a result, DSC-MATE-7478 has been awarded DSC-status under Safe classification.
