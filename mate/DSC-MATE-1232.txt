Description: Subject 1232 is a human male lawyer with normal blonde hair and an unusual obsession with details. They are often seen wearing a red victory band on their forehead, a gold earring in their right ear, and a red scarf around their neck. The most unusual aspect of their appearance is the LED gas mask they wear to filter out impurities from the air.

Subject 1232's tendency to be obsessively detail-oriented has resulted in unusual and often inexplicable behavior. They have been known to alphabetize their spice rack, color-code their closet, and spend hours meticulously cleaning their apartment. Their obsession with details has also made them a skilled lawyer, but their tendency to get caught up in the minutia of a case can lead to a lack of focus on the bigger picture.

Addendum: Interview 1232-1

During an interview with subject 1232, it was revealed that their obsession with details began after a traumatic childhood experience. They witnessed the murder of their parents and began obsessively analyzing every detail of the crime scene in an attempt to understand what had happened. This led to a fascination with details that has followed them into adulthood.

Despite their unusual behavior, subject 1232 is not considered dangerous at this time. However, due to their unpredictable nature and potential for harm, they must be closely monitored at all times.
