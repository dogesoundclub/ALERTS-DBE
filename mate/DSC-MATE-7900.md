Item #: 7900

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #7900 is to be housed in a standard human containment cell and monitored regularly for any signs of distress. They are allowed access to minimal recreational equipment and books, but are not to have access to any internet-enabled devices. Any visitors must be approved by Level 3 personnel.

Description: Item #7900 is a male human of average build and height, with a distinct mouth spot on the left side of their face. Their irises are red, resembling those of a clown, and their hair is parted in a pink hue. They wear a red victory band on their forehead, a gold earring on their left ear, a silver chain around their neck, and carry a candy stick at all times.

Despite their unusual appearance, Item #7900 possesses a natural charm and charisma that can easily infect those around them. They have a predisposed sense of humor and an eagerness to make people laugh, even to the point of silliness. This trait has proven to be useful in distracting and calming other subjects in containment.

It is important to note that while Item #7900 is generally easy-going and cooperative, they can become unpredictable when faced with stressful or overwhelming situations. In such an event, standard human restraining protocols should be employed until they can be properly sedated.

Addendum: Item #7900's skills in veterinary medicine have proven useful in the care of animal subjects within the facility, and they have been granted permission to assist in such cases under strict supervision.
