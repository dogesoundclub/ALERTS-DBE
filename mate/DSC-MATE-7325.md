Item #: 7325

Object Class: Villain

Special Containment Procedures: Due to his unpredictable nature and the potential for his idealistic beliefs to cause significant harm, 7325 must be kept in a high-security facility at all times. His medical mask and Red Scarf are to be maintained at all times, as they seem to trigger his heightened sense of morality. Any attempts to negotiate with or pacify 7325 must be authorized by Level 4 personnel.

Description: 7325 is a human male with a twisted sense of righteousness. His Blue Clown Eyes and unmistakable Smile are often accentuated by his Purple Cap with a Headset, a pair of goggles that remain affixed to his forehead, and a Jade earring that dangles from his left earlobe. Subject tends to wear a medical mask that may or may not conceal any sinister intentions.

Personality: Despite his overall malevolent nature, 7325 is plagued by a strong and idealistic desire to make the world a better place. He frequently seeks out opportunities to protest or boycott companies or causes he deems to veer away from his values. This underlying sense of righteousness, combined with his unpredictable behavior, makes 7325 an extremely volatile and dangerous individual to deal with.

It is imperative to monitor and track 7325's movements and potential activities to minimize collateral damage and any positive impact, promoting themselves as potential messengers of good. However, knowing the subject's true intentions, it is essential to protect yourself and your community from potential harm in his pursuit of a darker version of justice.
