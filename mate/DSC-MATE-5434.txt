Item #: 5434

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-5434 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with ample space for movement. The containment chamber must be equipped with a train track, signaling system for the train and should provide adequate impact-absorbing capacity. SCP-5434 is to provide with fresh vegetables and water on a routine basis.

Description:
SCP-5434 is a sapient Rabbit with blue clown eyes and a purple conductor's hat with a headset attached. He wears a silver chain accessory around his neck and a jade earring on each ear. In addition, SCP-5434 carries a candy stick at all times.

SCP-5434 is a Train Driver and is able to control any vehicle, regardless of shape, size, or make. With SCP-5434 at the helm, the train can seemingly move through the obstacles and barriers irrespective of the laws of physics.

SCP-5434 have an extraordinary attention to detail and tends to display their obsession with meticulous order in various ways such as alphabetizing the spice rack or color-coding their closet. This personality trait, while not anomalous, seems to be radically amplified within SCP-5434.

SCP-5434 often requests to assist in the maintenance of the train or is observed performing such activities. Hence, the scrutiny for any unnecessary tool, object, or gears is crucial.

Despite being non-aggressive in nature, SCP-5434 is exceptionally motivated to complete their task on time and can become agitated if not presented with the opportunities to do so.

Addendum:
SCP-5434 had caused widespread destruction in several cities of ████ in the past, which were attributed to train derailments. Since being contained in Site-███, SCP-5434 has shown no sign of aggression or obsession, and his behavior remains within expected levels. SCP-5434 is permitted the freedom to control the train systems inside the facility, as long as no harm comes to the facility or its occupants.
