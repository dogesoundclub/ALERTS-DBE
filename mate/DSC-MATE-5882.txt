SCP File-5882: "The Traverser"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5882 is to be contained within a standard human containment cell in Site-██. Under no circumstance, SCP-5882 is allowed to interact with other human subjects without authorization. SCP-5882 must wear a medical mask in public areas to prevent any anomalous properties from spreading.

Description: SCP-5882 is a male human traffic officer identified as Grant McCarthy. SCP-5882's face feature #1 is a series of brown spots across his nose and cheekbones. His eyes are unique due to the installation of Virtual Reality Rainbow LED technology that allows his sight to change colors at random intervals. The top of SCP-5882's head has a prominent gash, which he claims is the origin of his anomalous properties. He wears the attire of a monk, which he believes helps keep his duties in check. SCP-5882's most prominent feature is his personality, which can sometimes lead to humorous situations.

SCP-5882 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, regularly taking on more than he can handle. This results in multiple humorous situations, such as trying to fit all of his duties into a single day or carrying too many items at once. SCP-5882's body is capable of distorting for brief moments, often swapping his location within a few feet of his current position. The purpose behind this ability is unknown; SCP-5882 does not appear to have any control over it. SCP-5882's immediate environment remains unaltered, including objects that SCP-5882 directly touches. This anomalous property is restricted to the containment cell as SCP-5882 has no recollection of activating it outside of his job.

Addendum-5882-1:
SCP-5882 encountered the Foundation when he arrived at work one morning in ████. He approached a parking violation scene and apparently stumbled into one of Dr. Gears' experimental temporal anomaly devices. SCP-5882 was the only surviving member of his squad who had been attending to the call at the time, and no one else on the scene reported seeing the device. He has no recollection of encountering any temporal anomalies or Dr. Gears. SCP-5882 was taken into custody by the Foundation and contained under the Safe classification.

Addendum-5882-2:
Dr. █████ and Dr. ███████, after encouraging SCP-5882 to participate in several psychological tests, speculated that SCP-5882's unique personality and ability may be the result of a mental curse placed on him. Investigations are ongoing.
