Item #: SCP-7902

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7902 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a Faraday cage to prevent any communication with the outside world. SCP-7902 is allowed regular access to its electrical equipment and is to receive monthly psychiatric evaluations. In the event of any anomalous behavior, security personnel are authorized to use lethal force.

Description: SCP-7902 is a human male identified as an electrician. The subject is approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 82.5 kilograms. The subject's most notable feature is its appearance; its head is entirely made of metal and painted in a shade of purple. Its eyes are replaced by VR Rainbow LED, and it wears goggles on its forehead. It also has a green cross earring on its left earlobe. SCP-7902 always wears a medical mask and a red scarf. It speaks with a monotone voice.

SCP-7902 has a high level of attachment to its work routine and exhibits resistance to any changes. It may become agitated if faced with unexpected changes or situations, leading to potentially hazardous situations. The subject exhibits high levels of anxiety whenever its electrical equipment is unavailable. It is also noted that SCP-7902 has quirks, such as humming to himself while working on a project.

SCP-7902's electrical wiring capabilities cannot be replicated even by modern machines, and it can construct and deconstruct any electrical device in mere seconds when allowed access to appropriate materials. The electrical connections that SCP-7902 creates bypass the need for traditional components and work on a similar principle to bio-electric energy. SCP-7902's wiring is composed of electromagnetic particles that have never been detected outside the subject’s vicinity.

Observations indicate that SCP-7902 is aware of its anomalous nature. However, the subject is resistant to testing or any attempt to explain its abilities. It has refused to share any information about its creation or how it came to possess its abilities.

Addendum 7902-A: On ██/██/20██, SCP-7902 attempted to escape containment. After noticing that its electrical equipment was missing, it grew increasingly agitated and attacked several security personnel. SCP-7902 was subdued with electric stun batons and taken to a reinforced containment chamber. The incident highlighted the need for additional security measures regarding its electrical equipment.
