Item #: SCP-2187

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2187 is to be contained in its current location, which is a theater owned and operated by the Foundation. The theater is to be kept fully staffed and operational at all times, with no less than three Foundation personnel on site at all times. All performances are to be monitored via audio and video feeds, with the recordings being analyzed for any anomalous activity or behavior. SCP-2187 is not allowed to leave the theater without express permission from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2187 appears to be a male human of average height and weight, and operates as the manager of the theater in which it resides. SCP-2187 possesses several anomalous features, including a spot on its mouth that emits a bright light that can temporarily blind onlookers, and blue clown eyes that seem to have the ability to manipulate emotions in those who make eye contact with them.

SCP-2187 also has a two-color band on its forehead, and green cross earrings in its ears. SCP-2187 is often seen wearing a silver chain and a normal gas mask, though the reasons for these accessories are currently unknown.

SCP-2187 exhibits a strong sense of independence and can be resistant to authority, often sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission. It is recommended that Foundation personnel interact with SCP-2187 in a firm but understanding manner, as it is important to maintain a good working relationship with the entity.

SCP-2187 has not shown any signs of aggression, and appears to be cooperative with Foundation procedures, though caution is advised when dealing with any potentially anomalous behavior. All staff working with SCP-2187 should be equipped with protective gear as a precautionary measure.

Addendum: SCP-2187 has expressed a desire to perform on stage, though this request has been denied due to the potential risk of exposing the entity to the public. Alternatives are currently being considered.
