Item #: SCP-6952

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6952 is to be contained within its current residence, which is to be equipped with a security camera system for monitoring purposes. SCP-6952 is allowed to continue working as a theater manager, but is to report all interactions with anomalous or suspicious individuals to the Foundation immediately. Any individuals seeking contact with SCP-6952 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel and are to be monitored at all times during their interaction.

Description: SCP-6952 is a human female with brown hair styled in a 90s fashion. SCP-6952 is often seen wearing a jade earring and a gold chain around her neck, as well as smoking a cigarette. Notably, SCP-6952's smile is regarded by many to be particularly engaging.

SCP-6952 exhibits a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge in various social and professional settings. SCP-6952's confidence and decision making abilities are particularly notable, and have been recognized by several members of the Foundation.

SCP-6952's personality appears to be non-anomalous in nature, displaying no abnormal traits or behavior. However, the potential for SCP-6952 to encounter anomalous individuals or artifacts due to her occupation as a theater manager presents a potential risk to containment. As such, surveillance and monitoring of SCP-6952's interactions with outsiders is of utmost importance. 

Addendum: Incident Report 6952-01

On 09/12/20██, SCP-6952 reported an interaction with a man who identified himself as "The Great Zoltar". SCP-6952 described the individual as wearing a cape and top hat, and exhibiting suspicious behavior. SCP-6952 did not allow the individual access to the theater and promptly reported the interaction to the Foundation.

After investigation, it was determined that "The Great Zoltar" was a known anomalous individual with a history of theft and manipulation. SCP-6952's actions in this instance triggered a successful containment of the potential anomaly and prevented any further incidents. SCP-6952's vigilance and quick thinking are to be commended.
