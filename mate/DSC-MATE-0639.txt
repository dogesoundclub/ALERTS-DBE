Item #: SCP-639

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-639 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-639 is to be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher, who must undergo rigorous background checks and psychological evaluations before being granted clearance. To prevent accidental damage, SCP-639's police cap and gold earring are to be removed and placed in a secure locker when not being studied.

Description: SCP-639 appears to be a middle-aged human male of average height, with distinctive orange stripes on his face. His eyes are equipped with a VR Rainbow LED system, giving them an unusual appearance. SCP-639 is often seen wearing a police cap and a gold chain, which he reportedly received as gifts.

Despite his unusual appearance, SCP-639 is capable of passing as a normal human when necessary. He holds a job as a banker, and reportedly leads a quiet and unassuming life outside of his containment.

Personality traits appear to be one of the most unusual features of SCP-639. They tend to be very analytical and logical, and enjoy debating various topics with others. In fact, it is not uncommon for SCP-639 to challenge others to debates or arguments, often over trivial or minor issues. Foundation personnel have observed that SCP-639 particularly enjoys taking opposing sides to others' arguments, regardless of his personal beliefs.

Addendum: SCP-639 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after a report of a "man with glowing eyes" was made to local authorities. SCP agents were dispatched to bring SCP-639 into containment without incident. Further investigation into SCP-639's abilities and origin are ongoing.
