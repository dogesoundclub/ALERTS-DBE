Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4585 is to be monitored at all times by undercover agents within the political structure. Any attempt to disrupt or harm the subject is to be met swiftly and with appropriate force.

Description:

Subject 4585 is a human male of unknown age and origin, with a charming smile that can disarm even the most wary of individuals. The subject sports an unusual feature over his eyes, which resemble ski goggles. His hair is parted down the middle and dyed pink, while a gold earring adorns each ear. The subject often wears a bright red scarf and can frequently be seen smoking a cigarette.

Subject 4585 is a politician who has made significant strides in the political system. His powers of persuasion and charisma have allowed him to rise to higher ranks quickly. Many believe that some sort of anomalous influence is at work here, allowing the subject to sway even the most stubborn of political deadlock.

Researchers have noted that the subject appears to be in touch with his emotions. Touching moments in movies, TV shows, or even music and art can bring him to tears. It is unclear if this is related to any anomalous activity. Further study is required.

Addendum:

Agent 4585-1 has reported that the subject attempted to sway them with his persuasive abilities during a meeting. The agent reported that an overwhelming urge to agree with the subject's views almost overcame their own will. The agent was able to resist the subject's influence but noted in their report that the experience left a lasting impact. Extreme caution is advised when dealing with Subject 4585.
