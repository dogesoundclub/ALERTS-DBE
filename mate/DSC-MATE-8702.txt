SCP-8702 is a peculiar individual, possessing certain physical traits and behavioral patterns that make it stand out from its human counterparts. Though its appearance is that of a rabbit, it has assumed the role of a lawyer in the human world, and has been observed to perform its duties with a remarkable degree of professionalism and efficiency.

SCP-8702's face is characterized by a permanent expression of fear, with its trembling mouth never quite able to overcome its instinctive sense of trepidation. Its eyes, however, offset this timidity with a pair of horned rim glasses, suggesting a level of intellectualism and studiousness that is most unexpected in a creature of its kind.

Upon its head, SCP-8702 wears a bucket hat, which it seems to have tailored to fit its unique physiology. This is accompanied by a goggle on its forehead, presumably for protection from the harmful glare of screens, as well as gold earring, which is undoubtedly a nod to some personal aesthetic preference.

Perhaps the most conspicuous feature of SCP-8702 is the bright red scarf that it invariably wears, extending down to its chest. The significance of this accessory is unclear, though it may point to some underlying psychological need for comfort or security.

Despite its timid appearance, SCP-8702 possesses a strong, decisive personality, characterized by a directness and efficiency of speech and action that can be intimidating to those around it. It is, in a sense, a natural leader, though its commanding presence may be off-putting to some.

In conclusion, SCP-8702 is a highly capable lawyer, who possesses a unique combination of physical traits and personality quirks that make it an asset in its particular role. Its rabbit-like appearance may be at odds with its professional responsibilities, but SCP-8702 manages to make it work, proving that sometimes the most unexpected qualities can be the most valuable.
