Item #: 2758

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2758 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-2758 is permitted limited access to the on-site veterinary clinic for the health and well-being of the various animal specimens contained within the facility.

SCP-2758 is not to be allowed to interact with other personnel outside of scheduled appointments without prior approval for safety and security reasons. In the event of a containment breach, MTF Omega-10 (Destiny's Claw) will be dispatched to neutralize SCP-2758 as a last resort.

Description: SCP-2758 is a male tiger of the sub-species Panthera tigris tigris, approximately 2 meters in length and weighing approximately 250 kg. SCP-2758 appears to be a professional veterinarian, proficient in the treatment and care of a wide variety of animals. SCP-2758 displays an above-average intelligence and strong empathic abilities, often expressing deep emotions and sensitivity.

SCP-2758 is rarely seen without his signature jade earring and gold chain, and is often observed wearing horned rim glasses and an LED gas mask. Though subject to some scrutiny from fellow personnel, SCP-2758 insists that the gas mask is essential to protect himself from infectious diseases and particulate matters.

SCP-2758 has been known to form strong emotional bonds with various animal specimens, demonstrating a great fondness for nature and concern for the well-being of sentient beings. He has also displayed an uncanny ability to communicate with animals in a manner that suggests a degree of telepathy.

Attempts to communicate with SCP-2758 regarding his anomalous nature and origin have thus far proved unsuccessful, largely due to the SCP's reluctance to discuss the subject. However, it is believed that SCP-2758 is likely of supernatural origin, or the result of anomalous transfiguration.

Addendum 2758-1: Incident Report

On ██/██/202█, SCP-2758 became agitated during a routine checkup of an avian specimen. Despite efforts to calm SCP-2758, he proceeded to destroy the specimen's enclosure and injure several nearby personnel. MTF Omega-10 (Destiny's Claw) was called in to subdue SCP-2758, resulting in a mild injury to one agent.

Following the incident, SCP-2758 was placed on probationary status, and all future appointments with SCP-2758 must be scheduled in advance and supervised by at least two armed guards.
