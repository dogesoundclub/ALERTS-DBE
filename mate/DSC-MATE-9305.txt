SCP-9305, also known as "The Striped Witch," is a female human of average height and build. What sets her apart are the vibrant orange stripes that adorn her face, which seem to glow with an otherworldly energy. Her short, witch-like hair frames her face in wild waves, adding to her mysterious appearance. The Striped Witch is always seen wearing a standard gas mask, a strange accessory that amplifies her already eccentric vibe.

As a veterinarian, she possesses a deep understanding of animal behavior and anatomy, but her practical and inventive approach often leads her to use her skills in unconventional ways. Her resourcefulness and ingenuity have earned her a reputation for being able to fix just about anything with whatever's lying around. Known to whip out duct tape, paper clips, and other seemingly simple tools, she can create innovative solutions to problems that others would find too complicated.

Despite her practical nature, The Striped Witch has a warm personality and a contagious smile. Those who get to know her quickly realize that, beneath her quirky appearance, she's a passionate and kind-hearted individual, always willing to go the extra mile to help those in need. However, anyone who underestimates her due to her unorthodox methods does so at their own peril. For those who cross her, The Striped Witch has a wicked side, and rumors abound of her hexing those who dare to mess with her. 

Overall, SCP-9305 is a fascinating and enigmatic individual, a force to be reckoned with, and a valuable asset to any team in need of her unique skill set.
