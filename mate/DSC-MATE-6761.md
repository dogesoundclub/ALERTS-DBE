Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6761 is to be interviewed by Foundation personnel on a monthly basis to ensure their cooperation and to monitor any changes in behavior. DSC-MATE-6761 is to be allowed to continue their occupation as a firefighter, as it has proven to be an effective cover for their anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-6761 is not to be exposed to any high-stress situations or situations that may trigger their anomalous abilities.

Description: DSC-MATE-6761 appears to be a human male in their late 30s, standing at 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 185 lbs. DSC-MATE-6761's skin is marked with bright orange stripes, and their eyes resemble those of ski goggles. DSC-MATE-6761 sports a blue bandana on their head, with goggles resting on their forehead. In addition, DSC-MATE-6761 wears a jade earring on their left ear, and a medical mask on their mouth. They also wear a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-6761's anomalous properties appear to be triggered by their engagement with traditional rituals or practices. When DSC-MATE-6761 is engaged in such activity, they are able to manipulate fire at will, even when it is beyond their capacity to do so naturally. DSC-MATE-6761 has also been known to tell jokes or stories that have been passed down through their family or community, leading to humorous situations.

DSC-MATE-6761 has exhibited a bit of a no-nonsense attitude and values tradition, but they also have a playful side. It is unclear if this is a manifestation of their anomalous properties or their natural personality.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6761 came to the Foundation's attention after a routine fire call in which DSC-MATE-6761 appeared to have control over the flames beyond that of a normal firefighter. Through investigation, it was determined that DSC-MATE-6761 had been engaging in a traditional ritual prior to the call. The Foundation was able to recruit DSC-MATE-6761 shortly thereafter.
