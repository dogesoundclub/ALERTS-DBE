SCP-28, also known as Officer Green, is a human male police officer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. His unmistakable appearance includes a set of disconcerting blue clown eyes that seem to pierce through the thickest of fog. Despite his rigorous training and experience in law enforcement, Officer Green often appears with a frightened mouth, as if constantly struggling to contain the overwhelming knowledge he has accumulated over the years.

His head is a complex network of green layers, which appear to shift and move independently of one another, mimicking the constant workings of his brilliant mind. It is rare to see Officer Green without his gold chain, which he wears with pride as a symbol of his love for knowledge and dedication to his work.

In addition to his love for learning, Officer Green also possesses a kind heart, and frequently goes out of his way to help those in need. He is particularly fond of sharing his newfound knowledge with others, often going on tangents about various obscure topics that he finds fascinating.

Despite his fearsome appearance, Officer Green is a valuable member of the police force, equally adept at solving crimes and educating his fellow officers. The Foundation would be wise to keep an eye on this unique and valuable individual.
