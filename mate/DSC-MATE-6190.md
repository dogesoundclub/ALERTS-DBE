Item #: 6190

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6190 is to be monitored regularly through standard security measures. Any deviations from expected behaviour are to be immediately reported to higher authorities.

Description: Subject 6190 is a female veterinary practitioner with red clown eyes, which are believed to be due to a genetic anomaly. The subject wears a headset with LED lights, a gold chain necklace, and a normal gas mask at all times while on duty. The reason for the gas mask is unknown and may be due to personal preference.

Subject 6190's personality is characterized by a high degree of organization and reliability, which makes them an excellent nurse for the creatures under their care. However, subject 6190 has a stubborn streak and cannot easily adjust to new ideas or situations that deviate from their routines. This can lead to comical situations when faced with unexpected changes or when facing new challenges.

The subject is mostly cooperative and compliant with Foundation authorities, albeit with some degree of hesitation. No anomalous abilities have been identified in subject 6190, nor any indications of affiliation with anomalous entities.

Despite being a veterinarian, subject 6190 has allegedly provided medical attention to anomalous creatures, which has raised suspicions among Foundation personnel. It is recommended that the subject be monitored closely, and their loyalty to the Foundation be tested as required.

Further research into the origin of subject 6190's unusual traits may yield valuable insights into genetic anomalies and possibly lead to the discovery of more anomalous individuals.
