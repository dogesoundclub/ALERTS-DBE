Object Classification: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3068 is to be contained within its designated work area and is to be monitored at all times for any unusual behavior or activity. Any unauthorized individuals attempting to enter the area are to be immediately detained and questioned. SCP-3068 is only to be released from containment for designated work hours, and any interactions with civilians must be closely supervised.

Description: SCP-3068 is a human male, approximated to be in its late 30s, designated as a Traffic Officer for the local department. SCP-3068 exhibits two distinct facial features: a small, circular spot on the upper left of its mouth and an expression of fright. It routinely wears a Doge hat and normal glasses, along with a silver chain. SCP-3068 is otherwise physically unremarkable.

SCP-3068 displays a tendency to focus greatly on small details, and will often organize items based on arbitrary categorization. This behavior can manifest in domestic settings, where SCP-3068 will obsessively arrange its belongings in a specific order. Despite its role as a Traffic Officer, SCP-3068's organizational tendencies do not appear to negatively impact its performance in the workplace.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-3068 was observed engaging in atypical behavior while stationed at a busy intersection. SCP-3068 began directing traffic so erratically that several accidents occurred, and civilians were endangered. It is unclear at this time what caused this sudden deviation from SCP-3068's standard behavior. Further monitoring and investigation of SCP-3068 are ongoing.
