Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8341 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be furnished with a drafting table and various art supplies to keep SCP-8341 occupied. SCP-8341 is permitted to continue practicing their profession as a fashion designer on the condition that all garments constructed are inspected by a member of staff prior to release to the public.

Description: SCP-8341 is a humanoid entity that outwardly resembles a Bengal tiger. SCP-8341 wears a doge hat on top of their head and has been observed wearing nerd glasses and a jade earring. SCP-8341 also wears a silver chain around their neck, which they are protective of. SCP-8341 has heightened dexterity and is able to manipulate small objects with comparative ease. 

Personality: SCP-8341 is generally well-behaved and cooperative with staff. They exhibit a passion for their work as a fashion designer and are often lost in thought or working on a project. SCP-8341 can be forgetful and absent-minded, which can occasionally lead to humorous or concerning situations. SCP-8341 is known to become agitated if their silver chain is removed from their person.
