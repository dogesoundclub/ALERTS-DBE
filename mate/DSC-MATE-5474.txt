Item #: 5474

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5474 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-5474 should be allowed access to a television and internet, but should not be permitted to make contact with any news sources outside of foundation-approved channels. SCP-5474 is to be monitored for any displays of unpredictable or dangerous behavior.

Description: SCP-5474 is a male human news anchor with various unusual physical features. SCP-5474 has spots across his face and wears ski goggle lenses as his eyes. SCP-5474's head has a green coloration that appears to be naturally occurring, but has never been verified. SCP-5474 wears gold earrings in both ears.

SCP-5474 often wears a red scarf and carries a candy stick as a personal accessory. SCP-5474 can be characterized as reckless, often participating in dangerous activities without considering the potential consequences. SCP-5474's carefree demeanor and impulsive tendencies can occasionally cause minor accidents and injuries.

Addendum: SCP-5474 has repeatedly shown an interest in broadcasting anomalous stories on their news program. While this interest is prohibited by foundation regulations, it may indicate a potential susceptibility to anomalous influences. SCP-5474's containment procedures should remain in place until the possible AEPs (Anomalous Effects/Hnau/Aanval) are identified and documented.
