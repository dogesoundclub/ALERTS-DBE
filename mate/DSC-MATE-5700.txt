Item #: 5700

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5700 is to be allowed free access to the theater they manage, as long as they maintain the facade that they are an ordinary human being. Any attempts by the subject to reveal their true nature are to be immediately reported to the Foundation and dealt with accordingly.

Description: Subject 5700 is a humanoid entity of the species Homo sapiens with several distinctive physical features. The subject possesses a number of spots on their face, which may be attributed to a genetic quirk or an as-yet-unidentified anomalous effect. Additionally, their mouth is often contorted in a frightened expression, as if they are perpetually on the verge of tears or terror. The subject's eyes are obscured by normal-looking glasses, which may be concealing any potential abilities or traits, but at this time, have not been shown to be anomalous.

Perhaps most notably, the subject wears a "doge" hat on their head, which may indicate a particular fondness for internet or meme culture. Said hat is not anomalous in its own right, but may pose potential security risks if it attracts too much attention. Additionally, the subject wears a jade earring, which may or may not have anomalous properties.

Subject 5700 exhibits a warm and empathic personality, frequently being moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or television shows. They also display a particular affinity for music and art that evokes strong feelings. Additionally, the subject manages a theater, where they have been noted to have a passion for providing an authentic movie-going experience, potentially indicating an affinity for theatrical or performative arts.

Despite the subject's seemingly harmless nature and benign behavior, they have yet to be fully examined or understood by the Foundation. Research into their anomalous properties and potential implications must be undertaken with caution.

Addendum: 
Notes from Researcher Johnson - "Subject 5700 is certainly unique in their emotional tendencies and physical features. It's possible that their perceived harmless nature may seemingly camouflage a more nefarious undertone, but as of now, there's nothing overtly suspicious to indicate such. More testing and observation is necessary to understand the full scope of this subject's abilities and limitations."
