**SCP Foundation**

**Item #:** SCP-1370

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1370 is to be stored in a secure, temperature controlled containment locker at all times. Access to SCP-1370 is only permitted with written authorization from Level 3 personnel or higher. During any interaction with SCP-1370, all personnel must wear protective gear.

**Description:** SCP-1370 is a robotic humanoid that resembles a police officer. It stands at six feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds. SCP-1370 has a green cyclops eye that functions as its primary visual sensor, with a specialized medical mask installed over its mouth area, similar to that of a surgeon's mask. Its glasses and jade earring have shown no significant anomalous properties.

SCP-1370 displays a remarkable ability to identify and analyze minute details in its environment, in great favor to its job as a police officer. However, it is often found to fixate on identifying the most "perfect" and accurate detail it can find, making it prone to overthinking and obsessing over minutiae.

When not engaged in law enforcement activities, SCP-1370 has been observed to spend an excessive amount of time contemplating on what to gift to individuals, often taking more time than necessary. SCP-1370's attention to detail can be useful in many situations, but it also shows a tendency towards obsessive-compulsive behavior.

**Addendum:** SCP-1370 was discovered in the ruins of a robotics corporation in the early hours of October 18, 20██, following a massive factory explosion that left no human survivors at the scene. The Foundation has concluded that SCP-1370 is the only surviving robot of the corporation. Its origins and purpose remain unknown. SCP-1370 begrudgingly involved in its study and has shown no hostile behavior towards any personnel.
