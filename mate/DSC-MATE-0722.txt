Item #: SCP-722

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-722 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. Personnel are not to approach SCP-722 without proper authorization from Level 4 personnel given the unpredictable nature of SCP-722. Any interaction with SCP-722 requires the presence of at least one armed guard at all times to prevent any harm to personnel.

Description: SCP-722 is a male Bengal tiger standing approximately 2 meters tall and weighing 190 kg. SCP-722's face is characterized by a permanent expression of fear, and its eyes resemble those of a clown with bright blue irises. SCP-722 sports a police cap on its head and a red scarf around its neck. The tiger also possesses two bands on its forehead, one green and the other orange, which appear to have a cultural significance.

SCP-722 has a playful side and values tradition. SCP-722's personality is somewhat conservative and no-nonsense, but it may from time to time tell jokes or stories that have been passed down through its family or community. SCP-722 is a train driver by profession and insists on wearing its uniform when it is on duty.

SCP-722 is frequently seen in possession of a candy stick, which it uses for stress relief. Despite its playful nature, SCP-722 can also be dangerous when provoked or threatened. It possesses inhuman strength and agility, easily overpowering and causing severe injuries or death to its victims. SCP-722 should, therefore, be approached with utmost caution.

Addendum: SCP-722 was discovered following a series of train derailments in rural ███████, all of which occurred on tracks where SCP-722 had been the conductor. After several fatalities and eyewitness statements describing a "furry monster" at the scene of the incidents, Foundation agents were able to apprehend SCP-722 and transport it to Site-██ for containment.
