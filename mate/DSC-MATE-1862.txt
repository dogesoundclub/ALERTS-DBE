Item #: SCP-1862

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1862 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times. Although its species is a rabbit, SCP-1862 has demonstrated intelligence and technological aptitude above that of a normal rabbit, making it difficult to predict its behavior. All of SCP-1862's personal possessions are to be kept within its containment unit and are not to be removed without proper authorization from at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1862 is a male anthropomorphic rabbit approximately 1.2 meters in height. SCP-1862's distinctive features include a frightened expression on its mouth, a retro cap on its head, and a gold chain and candy stick as accessories. Its eyes are currently unknown as SCP-1862 refuses to open them near Foundation personnel.

SCP-1862 has demonstrated proficiency as an electrician, possessing knowledge of electrical engineering beyond that of a normal rabbit. Additionally, SCP-1862 has a creative and artistic side, often expressing itself through various forms such as painting, drawing, and writing. SCP-1862's forehead also features a unique two-color band and a jade earring worn on one of its ears.

SCP-1862 was captured after it was reported by local authorities for causing various electrical outages and disturbances due to its unusual approach to electrical work. SCP-1862 has since been relocated to Foundation custody and has cooperated with personnel.

Addendum: SCP-1862 has requested to be referred to by the name "Carrot" and has expressed a desire to explore new forms of artistic expression. Requests for additional art supplies and materials have been approved by Foundation personnel.
