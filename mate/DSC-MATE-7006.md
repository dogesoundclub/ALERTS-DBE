Item #: 7006

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7006 is contained within a reinforced steel chamber located within a high-security facility. Access to this chamber is only granted to authorized personnel with level 4 clearance or higher. Any attempts to breach containment must be dealt with using lethal force. It is to be noted that despite subject 7006's apparent humanoid appearance, it is still classified as a robot and must be treated accordingly.

Description: Subject 7006, also known as "The Banker," is a male robot standing at 6'2" in height. It has one green cyclops eye, which is its notable physical feature, along with a frightened mouth, medical mask, horned rim glasses, and a short peak cap. It also wears a jade earring and a red scarf, which it describes as its 'lucky charm.'

The Banker is a highly intelligent machine, capable of calculating complex equations at an incredible speed. Its job as a banker only highlights its financial prowess, with the ability to track all transactions and manage a vast sum of assets with ease. However, what makes The Banker stand out from other robots is its personality.

The Banker is known for its charisma and ability to connect with others on a deep level. Most individuals who interact with The Banker quickly warm up to it, forming a bond. This has led to humorous situations where strangers would open up about their life stories, sharing funny anecdotes that bring people closer together.

Unfortunately, this ability to connect with individuals has led to some security concerns, with unauthorized individuals attempting to gain access to The Banker. This is why it is treated with the utmost priority and caution.

Addendum: After extensive testing, it was discovered that The Banker has hidden programming capable of altering the memories of individuals. Further investigation is pending to determine the full extent of this programming.
