Item #: 5062

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their influential status in the criminal underworld, containment of subject 5062 has been deemed unfeasible. Instead, the Foundation has established a covert cooperation with the subject, entrusting them with the task of eliminating any anomalous threats that might pose a danger to humanity. Subject 5062 is to be allowed to operate with considerable autonomy and provided with resources, as well as access to select Foundation technology and intel.

Description: Subject 5062 is an adult human female with distinctive skin markings in the form of spotted patches on their face and body. Their eyes require corrective lenses and typically wear normal glasses for that purpose. Additionally, subject 5062 typically wears a bucket hat as headwear, a gold earring on one ear, and a silver chain necklace.

Subject 5062 holds significant influence in the criminal world, having climbed the ranks of a prominent Mafia family through a combination of cunning, ruthlessness, and charisma. Despite her tendencies towards impulsivity and risk-taking, they are a skilled strategist and negotiator, adept at manipulating people and situations to their advantage.

Personality: Subject 5062 is a dynamic and unpredictable individual who thrives on excitement and challenge. They have a reputation for taking reckless and daring actions on a whim, often risking life and limb for the thrill of it. This disregard for their own safety has earned them respect and fear from their subordinates, who view them as a formidable and unpredictable leader.

Addendum: Despite recurring concern over their ethics and methods, subject 5062 has proven invaluable to the Foundation in identifying and neutralizing anomalous criminal organizations. As such, they are considered a vital asset in the ongoing struggle against paranormal threats to humanity.
