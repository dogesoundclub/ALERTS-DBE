Item #: 2835

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2835 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a security guard in Site-██. A security detail of no less than two personnel is to accompany 2835 on all patrols. Any unusual behavior is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: Subject 2835 appears to be a male human of average height and build. Their face displays a constant expression of fear, with slightly parted lips and wide eyes. The upper portion of their head is covered by multiple layers of green fabric, and a pair of goggles sit on their forehead. They are often seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a candy stick.

2835 exhibits a highly empathetic and compassionate personality, with a tendency to take on the problems of others as their own. While admirable, this trait can lead to exhaustion and burnout. As such, continued psychological evaluation is recommended.

Despite their fears and anxieties, 2835 is a dedicated and vigilant security guard. They diligently perform their duties, and their attention to detail has made them an asset to Site-██.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, 2835 was noted to have displayed signs of stress and anxiety in response to a containment breach. When questioned, they admitted to feeling responsible for the breach and the harm caused to personnel. Counseling sessions have been arranged and 2835 has been reminded of the importance of self-care and seeking assistance when feeling overwhelmed. Further monitoring is advised.
