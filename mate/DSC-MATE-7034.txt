Item #: SCP-7034

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7034 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a news broadcasting studio. Access to SCP-7034 is restricted to Level-3 personnel and above. Any and all broadcasts starring SCP-7034 must be carefully scrutinized before public release.

Description:

SCP-7034 is a male monkey of an as-yet unknown species, bearing a frightened mouth and a pair of ski goggle eyes. Its head is adorned with a blue bandana while a gold earring is affixed to its left ear. SCP-7034 is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7034 works as a news anchor and is perfectly capable of speaking like a human, though due to its simian origins, its diction and accent can be poor at times. It is a practical and hands-on individual and known for fixing objects in unconventional ways, using whatever is available to create makeshift solutions that are often successful.

SCP-7034 is also capable of creating entertaining and compelling news broadcasts that have appealed to humans and primates alike. However, it has developed a tendency to include personal opinions and political commentary in its broadcasts, which have led to several controversies and complaints.

Analysis of SCP-7034â€™s DNA has been inconclusive so far, and it's currently unclear whether it acquired its human-like appearance and intelligence through natural evolution or by some unknown SCP Objects or anomalies. Further research is ongoing.

Addendum:

The Foundation's intelligence division is closely monitoring the personal social network and media activities of SCP-7034, its family, and its friends to identify possible anomalies or abnormal contacts. So far, no significant abnormal activity has been discovered, but the surveillance is ongoing.
