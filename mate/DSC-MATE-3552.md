Object Class: Tiger

Special Containment Procedures: Item 3552 is not to be approached without the consent of the Foundation's animal care team. Said team must be equipped with tranquilizer darts and proper protection wear at all times. Item 3552 requires a large enclosure with a variety of foliage and water resources. A diet consisting of raw meat must be provided on a daily basis.

Description: Item 3552 is a male tiger with features unique to his species. His fur is a stark orange with black stripes, and his eyes appear to have been replaced with VR Jade LED technology. Item 3552 accessorizes with a red beanie and jade earring, along with a whistle.

Personality: Item 3552 is an incredibly detail-oriented individual. Though such a trait is common among tigers, Item 3552 takes it to unprecedented levels. He alphabetizes his spice rack, color-codes his closet, and refuses to leave his enclosure until everything is precisely how he wants it. Though his obsession often lends itself more to methodical behavior than anything harmful, the Foundation still recommends caution in approach.

Addendum: Item 3552 was discovered working as a car salesman in a local dealership. After several reports of Item 3552 taking an unhealthy interest in the intricate details of each car, witnesses began to take notice of his unique features. The Foundation was informed and safely acquired Item 3552 without incident.
