Item #: 9544

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9544 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber, furnished with a desk, computer and any necessary equipment to accommodate its programming tasks. The chamber must be fitted with soundproofing material to avoid disturbing other personnel. DSC-MATE-9544 is required to wear a hazmat suit for reasons of safety and hygiene.

Description: DSC-MATE-9544 is a male rhesus monkey with normal glasses seated in front of a computer. A red beanie can be seen on its head, while a pair of goggles serves as its forehead feature. DSC-MATE-9544 is often seen with a red scarf and a candy stick. The monkey appears to be capable of understanding and following complex programming tasks, showing considerable talent in coding and programming languages.

DSC-MATE-9544 displays a dry sense of humor, frequently delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. Despite its quiet disposition, DSC-MATE-9544 can be quite sociable, engaging with personnel in a friendly, non-threatening way. 

DSC-MATE-9544 was discovered in a laboratory where it had been subjected to genetic experiments. The presumed goal was to create an intelligent monkey with capabilities akin to those of a human programmer. It is uncertain how the monkey acquired its dry humor, but it may have come about as a result of the experiments carried out on it. DSC-MATE-9544 shows no signs of abnormal behavior or illness, and it is likely that it can live a healthy and lengthy life, provided that it is properly cared for. 

Addendum: Researchers have suggested that DSC-MATE-9544's abilities may be harnessed for the Foundation's future projects, given its exceptional programming skills. However, due to ethical concerns, no such projects will be assigned to DSC-MATE-9544 without securing proper approvals from the Ethics Committee.
