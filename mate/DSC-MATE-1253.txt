Item #: 1253

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1253 is currently a member of the local fire department and remains in close proximity to the Foundation. SCP-1253 is to be monitored at all times and in the event of a breach, a team of armed guards shall be deployed immediately. SCP-1253 is forbidden to divulge information about the Foundation or its work to anyone outside of Foundation personnel, under penalty of termination.

Description: SCP-1253 is a male tiger, sporting blue clown eyes and a blue bandana on its head. Its left ear is pierced with a jade earring and its mouth is always covered by a medical mask. SCP-1253 is known to possess an anomalous ability to control and manipulate flames, making it an extremely useful asset to the Foundation in cases of fire-based anomalies.

SCP-1253's personality is unusual in that it possesses a dry sense of humor, often catching others off guard. While SCP-1253 may not consider itself the life of the party, it has a unique way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly humorous. Researchers who've worked with SCP-1253 report that its sense of humor and quips have a mild memetic effect, leading them to develop an attachment to the tiger and risking potential breaches in containment.

Addendum 1253-1: Incident Report

On [REDACTED], SCP-1253 was dispatched to a fire-related incident outside SCP-173's containment unit. Due to the volatile nature of SCP-173, all personnel were immediately put on high alert. SCP-1253, however, managed to calm the flames and contain the situation with remarkable ease. During a debrief, SCP-1253 joked that it was only fair that the Foundation invested in a "fire-resistant peanut butter jar" to contain SCP-173; this caused significant stress among the attending researchers.

Whilst SCP-1253's ability to defuse a potentially catastrophic situation was appreciated, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring SCP-1253's behavior and the influence it can have on those around it.
