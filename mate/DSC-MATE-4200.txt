Item #: SCP-4200

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4200 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-4200 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-4200 is allowed to practice law and attend court hearings, but is to be accompanied by Foundation agents at all times. Any anomalous behavior exhibited by SCP-4200 is to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-4200 is a human female with distinctive spots on her face and a red-colored pair of lips. SCP-4200's eyes are cybernetic and emit a rainbow LED glow. SCP-4200 usually wears a green cross earring on her left ear and a silver chain necklace. SCP-4200 is also known for frequently smoking a cigarette.

SCP-4200 displays a personality that is characterized by strong attention to detail and an obsessive nature. This behavior can be seen in mundane tasks as well as in her professional work as a lawyer. SCP-4200 has been observed organizing her belongings in a meticulous manner, and she alphabetizes her spice rack and color-codes her closet. Despite this, SCP-4200 has shown significant competence in the courtroom.

Notably, SCP-4200's cybernetic eyes are capable of recording and displaying visual data. SCP-4200 has utilized this capability to assist in legal cases by recording and replaying visual evidence. Foundation scientists are still assessing the full extent of SCP-4200's cybernetic enhancements.

Addendum: Incident Report 4200-A

On ██/██/20██, SCP-4200 showed anomalous behavior during a routine court hearing. SCP-4200 became fixated on the defendant's shirt pattern, repeatedly claiming that it did not match the alleged crime. This behavior persisted despite evidence to the contrary.

Foundation agents intervened and escorted SCP-4200 from the courtroom. In further examination, it was discovered that SCP-4200's cybernetic eyes had malfunctioned and caused a discrepancy in her perception of the defendant's clothing. The eyes were repaired, and SCP-4200 exhibited no further anomalous behavior.

Further precautions have been put in place to monitor SCP-4200's cybernetic enhancements.
