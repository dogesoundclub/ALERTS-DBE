Item #: SCP-8418

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8418 is to be kept in a secure location at all times. Access to SCP-8418 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Any personnel interacting with SCP-8418 must be licensed in robotics and have received training on proper protocol for interacting with anomalous entities.

Description: SCP-8418 appears to be a robotic humanoid, with a green cyclops eye and horned rim glasses acting as a substitute for its other eye. SCP-8418 is a farmer by trade, and is often seen wearing a red beanie with a goggle on its forehead, a red cross earring, and a gold chain. It also carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-8418 displays unusual behavior for a robot, showing empathy and compassion towards others. However, this behavior can sometimes result in it taking on the problems of others as its own. This has lead to exhaustion in the past and is therefore considered a possible weakness. SCP-8418 is capable of repairing machinery and is often seen helping other robots in need.

Addendum: SCP-8418 was found in a field, seemingly abandoned. Upon inspection, it appeared to be malfunctioning and in need of repair. After being brought in and examined, it was discovered to be sentient and displaying advanced repair capabilities. SCP-8418 was then deemed an anomaly and given the SCP designation.
