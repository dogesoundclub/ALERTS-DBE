Interview Log 1146-A

Dr. █████: Good evening, SCP-1146. Can you describe your organization's activities?

SCP-1146: Ah, yes. We dabble in a little bit of everything, you know? Protection... insurance... gambling... we like to keep a diverse portfolio.

Dr. █████: I see. And what led you to become the leader of La Famiglia?

SCP-1146: (Chuckles) I suppose it was destiny. When you're born into a certain lifestyle, well, it's hard to escape it. And I've always had a certain... charisma. People seem to be drawn to me.

Dr. █████: Fascinating. Now, onto a more personal question. You have a reputation for being forgetful. Can you tell me about that?

SCP-1146: (Sighs) Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I get caught up in my thoughts and lose track of time, forget appointments, stuff like that. My associates are always reminding me, bless their hearts.

Dr. █████: Have you ever missed an important meeting or event due to your forgetfulness?

SCP-1146: (Pauses) Yeah, once or twice, I suppose. But that's just the price you pay for being a busy man, you know? Gotta keep moving forward.

Dr. █████: Thank you for your time, SCP-1146.

SCP-1146: Anytime, doc. Anytime.
