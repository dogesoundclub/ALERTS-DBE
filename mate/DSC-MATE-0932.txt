SCP-932 is an anomalous rabbit with a penchant for salesmanship. His green fur, unkempt and unarranged, belies the sharp wit and personality that make him one of the most likable rabbits in our Foundation's employ.

SCP-932's defining features include a pair of goggles affixed to his forehead and a single jade earring hanging from his left ear. He is often seen sporting a silver chain around his neck, although its purpose remains largely unknown.

As a car salesman, SCP-932 has a deep understanding of human nature and the innate desire for creature comforts. He uses this knowledge to his advantage in sales pitches to both staff and potential clients. Despite his success, SCP-932 does not exhibit the greed often associated with salesmen. Rather, he seems to genuinely enjoy making people happy and will go to great lengths to ensure their satisfaction.

SCP-932 has a great sense of humor and enjoys entertaining others with jokes, funny stories, and silly impersonations. His humor has been known to diffuse tense situations and lighten the mood in even the most stressful of circumstances.

Despite SCP-932's amiable nature, caution is advised when interacting with him. His anomalous abilities have yet to be fully understood and could pose a potential danger to unwitting or unsupervised staff.
