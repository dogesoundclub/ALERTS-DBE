Item #: 5531

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5531 is to be monitored at all times by a minimum of two agents. Any potential triggers for recklessness or impulsivity are to be removed from her environment as much as possible to prevent unexpected accidents. In the event of a containment breach, 5531 is to be apprehended immediately and returned to Foundation custody for further evaluation and containment.

Description: Subject 5531 appears to be a young human female with distinctive features. Her face is adorned with spots and a purple lip, but it is her eyes that truly stand out - they are a bright red clown-like color that may be associated with a potential cognitohazardous effect. Her clothing and hairstyle give her the appearance of a 00s school girl, and she wears a red cross earring as well as a silver chain.

Behaviorally, 5531 displays a tendency towards impulsivity and recklessness. She has been known to act before thinking, often resulting in minor accidents and comical mishaps. It is unclear whether this behavior is due to the 5531's own personality, or if there are other anomalous properties at work.

Additional Notes: Subject 5531's background and potential ties to other anomalies are currently under investigation. It is imperative that caution is exercised when interacting with or containing 5531, as her erratic behavior may pose a danger to herself and others.
