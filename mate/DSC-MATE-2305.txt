Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-2305 is to be housed within a secure medical facility and allowed to practice medicine freely. Standard medical equipment is to be provided, and human subjects in need of medical attention may be referred for treatment. SCP-2305 is not to be allowed access to anomalous artifacts, creatures, or materials.

Description:
SCP-2305 is a human female (designated "Doctor") with a variety of unique physical attributes. She possesses a sharp, red-lipped mouth, and her hair is a metal blue hue. SCP-2305 habitually wears a pair of goggles atop her brow, and a green cross earring in each ear. A gold chain is also present around her neck. 

Despite her physical abnormalities, SCP-2305 gets by as a normal human doctor in society. She is prone to moments of absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, which can create humorous scenarios such as missed appointments and lost track of time. Despite this, she remains a skilled practitioner in her field, and is able to provide effective medical treatments for common afflictions.

SCP-2305's origins and the source of her unique physical features remain unknown. No anomalous properties have been detected in SCP-2305 herself, but caution should still be exercised in her handling and exposure to anomalous substances or materials.
