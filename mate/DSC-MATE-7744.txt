SCP-7744, designated as "Doctor Smile", is a human male with an unusual appearance. His most noticeable feature is his ever-present smile, which appears to be fixed in place regardless of circumstance. His eyes are fitted with VR Rainbow LED technology, which gives them a distinctive glow that shifts through various colors.

The doctor wears a pair of goggles on his forehead, which seem to serve no practical purpose. Rumors have circulated that they are some kind of magical artifact that grants him supernatural abilities, but no evidence has been found to support these claims. He also sports a red scarf, which he claims is a good luck charm that he never leaves home without.

Despite his jovial exterior, Doctor Smile has a tendency to be absent-minded and scatterbrained. This can lead to some comical situations, but can also be cause for concern when dealing with patients. He has been known to forget important appointments or to wander off track while attempting to find his way around, often needing to rely on others for directions.

While his personality can be a bit chaotic, Doctor Smile is a skilled healer with a heart of gold. He genuinely cares for his patients and goes to great lengths to ensure their well-being. Despite his quirks, he is a valuable member of any team and a trusted ally in the fight against supernatural threats.
