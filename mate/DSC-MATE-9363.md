Item #: 9363

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject, identified as Traffic Officer 9363, is to be assigned to a team of Mobile Task Forces specializing in anomalous event management. Personnel assigned to 9363 must be trained to handle anomalous situations and have suitable clearance levels.

Personnel must not attempt to engage in conversations with 9363 unless authorized by a senior officer in case of emergency situations.

Description: 9363 is a human male of average height, with a distinct green layered hairdo. The subject's face features a prominent mouth spot, and their eyes are often concealed behind prescription glasses.

On occasions, 9363 may dawn a pair of goggles on their forehead or a gas mask, which is typical for their job as a Traffic Officer. They also don a gold earring on their left earlobe.

Perhaps the most remarkable trait of 9363 is their remarkably strong sense of intuition. They can predict events before they happen or sense when people are feeling unhappy or nervous.

While this ability can sometimes come off as uncanny, it can be incredibly advantageous when handling supernatural situations, especially when there's a need to analyze possible outcomes of an event.

Personnel interacting with 9363 should remain cautious and respectful at all times, as the subject's heightened intuition may be triggered if any harm or danger is presented to anyone in the immediate vicinity.

Addendum: In light of recent anomalous events and 9363's track record, valuable recommendations suggest that its use in Fireteam is entirely justified.
