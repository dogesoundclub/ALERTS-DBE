Item No.: 210

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-210 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any requests made by SCP-210 for additional medical equipment or veterinary supplies must be approved by at least two Level-3 personnel before being provided. SCP-210 must also undergo regular psychological evaluations to ensure no emotional disturbances have developed during its captivity.

Description: SCP-210 is a human female of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 162 cm in height and weighing roughly 55 kgs. It has short hair, which is dyed a dark shade of purple, and is always seen wearing a gold chain. SCP-210's most unusual feature is the red clown-like eyes combined with bright red lipstick, which gives it a distinct and unusual appearance. It has a red cross earring worn on its right earlobe.

SCP-210 professes to be a trained veterinarian and displays an extraordinary level of dedication towards its work which often results in it taking on too much work. SCP-210's unrelenting commitment to duty can cause humorous situations, such as attempting to undertake several tasks during one day or carrying too many things at once.

SCP-210's notable areas of expertise are the treatment and care of animals. So far, there has been no indication that SCP-210 possesses any unusual abilities or powers beyond its proficiency in animal care.  It remains to be seen whether SCP-210's loyalty and commitment to its work will maintain consistency as its containment duration increases.

Addendum: SCP-210 was apprehended in Florida in 20██ after being observed leaving a veterinary clinic in the local area. The law enforcement officials on duty administered minor injuries to SCP-210 before Foundation agents were dispatched and managed to apprehend it, and subsequent medical treatments were administered. SCP-210 was verified to be more appropriate for containment by the Foundation and subsequently transferred to Site-██.
