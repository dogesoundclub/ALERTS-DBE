SCP-9074 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 3 feet tall on average. The subject's VR rainbow LED eyes are the most striking feature of its appearance, flashing different colors depending on its mood. The head of SCP-9074 is almost always adorned with a LED headset, making it appear more futuristic than other rabbits. 

SCP-9074's physical appearance is further enhanced by a silver chain worn around its neck and a whistle dangling from it. This is likely due to the subject's occupation as a banker, where a whistle could come in handy during emergency situations. 

SCP-9074's personality is that of a fervent idealist, with an unwavering desire to make the world a better place. However, this can sometimes result in humorous situations, where SCP-9074 protests or boycotts a company it feels goes against its values. Instances of SCP-9074 supporting various charitable causes have been documented, leading to speculation that the subject may harbor a selfless streak. 

SCP-9074 should be considered friendly, but possibly unstable. Anyone interacting with SCP-9074 should exercise caution and be prepared to deal with unexpected actions or reactions. As always, Foundation personnel are reminded to handle SCP-9074 with the utmost care, as it is an anomaly and should be treated with the same respect as any other.
