Description: 

9775 is a male human of approximately 6 feet in height. He is most commonly seen wearing a red scarf and a medical mask over his mouth. His face is characterized by a unique dark spot around his mouth, which contrasts with his unnervingly wide and constant smile. His eyes are often obscured by a pair of normal glasses and he wears a gold earring in his left ear. 

Personality: 

9775 displays a distinct sense of curiosity toward the world that surrounds him. He has a propensity for seeking out obscure and unusual information, which he is not afraid to share with others. His communication style often involves spouting random trivia or facts that can be jarring and disorienting to those who are not familiar with him. Although seemingly harmless, his playful and quirky nature can quickly dissolve into defiance and malicious intent when provoked. 

Under no circumstances should 9775 be underestimated or taken lightly. His intelligence and ability to manipulate situations make him a formidable opponent, and it is recommended that all contact with him be avoided. 

Addendum: 

It has come to the attention of Foundation personnel that 9775 has made a habit of targeting vulnerable children as a means of obtaining information or leverage. All personnel are advised to remain vigilant in order to prevent any further harm from coming to those who fall under his influence.
