Name: SCP-4205 "The Jester"

Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4205 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All interactions with SCP-4205 must be conducted via video surveillance and audio communication to minimize risk of contamination. SCP-4205 is not to be allowed to leave the containment facility except under heavily monitored circumstances and with the permission of at least two Level-4 personnel. All personnel interacting with SCP-4205 must wear full protective equipment, including respiratory masks and eye shields.

Description: SCP-4205 is a human female lawyer with clown-like features. She stands at 5'5" tall and weighs approximately 135 pounds. SCP-4205's most notable feature is her bright red clown eyes, which emit a hypnotic effect that can cause those who look into them to become disoriented and suggestible. Her face is almost always adorned with a smile, and she wears a bucket hat and a medical mask to conceal her features. SCP-4205 also wears a jade earring and a silver chain.

SCP-4205 is an extremely outgoing and social individual who enjoys being the center of attention. She is known for her wit and humor, often telling jokes that are so funny that they can cause uncontrollable laughter in those around her. SCP-4205 has been observed to be very persuasive and can influence individuals to do things that they would not normally do.

SCP-4205's anomalous properties extend beyond her clown features. She has demonstrated the ability to produce various types of substances from her body, including but not limited to confetti, glitter, and foam. SCP-4205's anomalous properties also include the ability to create small portals that lead to an unknown location. SCP-4205 has refused to disclose the exact nature of these portals.

Addendum: SCP-4205 was discovered after reports of a lawyer with clown-like features causing hysteria in a courtroom. Foundation personnel were able to contain SCP-4205, and she has been under containment since. SCP-4205 has been cooperating with Foundation personnel and has shown no signs of hostility.
