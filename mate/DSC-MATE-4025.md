Even when in dire need, the rabbit character can often be found trying to move a heavy piece of furniture on their own or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost, leading to some humorous situations.

The character often accessorizes with a gold chain, portraying their affinity towards luxury and extravagant living. When dealing with situations or tasks presented to them, DSC-MATE-4025 can be combative, but their competence and dedication towards their job are undeniable.
