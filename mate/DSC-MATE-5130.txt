Item #: SCP-5130

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5130 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The entity is to be provided with a sufficient amount of food and water and is required to undergo periodic psychological evaluations to monitor any changes in behavior. Special attention should be given to any signs of psychic abilities or intuition. Any indication of such abilities should be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-5130 is a male tiger with striking red clown eyes. The entity's head is adorned with a police cap, and its ears are pierced with a red cross earring. SCP-5130 bears a silver chain around its neck as an additional accessory.

SCP-5130 is employed as a programmer, dealing primarily with software development. Despite its job, it is not uncommon for SCP-5130 to display unique abilities that cannot be explained through conventional means. These abilities resemble psychic powers, such as predicting future events or sensing the emotional state of others.

The entity has a strong sense of intuition and can often be found attempting to help others before they have expressed a need. Some personnel report feeling uncomfortable around SCP-5130 due to the eerie nature of these abilities.

Personality: SCP-5130 is generally cooperative and responsive during interviews and evaluations. It displays a friendly disposition towards Foundation personnel, although it maintains a certain sense of distance to prevent emotionally attaching to anyone.

SCP-5130's psychic abilities are not fully understood, and its unique personality traits further complicate the Foundation's attempts at understanding the entity. Further study is required to understand the capabilities and motivations of SCP-5130.
