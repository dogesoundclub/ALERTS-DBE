Description: DSC-MATE-7545 is a male robot of unknown origin, designed to resemble a journalist or reporter. Its one eye is a green cyclops-like feature, with lenses resembling those of ski goggles covering its lower face.

This behavior can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, such as getting lost or being seriously injured during extreme activities. When asked about its past experiences, DSC-MATE-7545 becomes evasive, leading to speculation that it may have been involved in dangerous or illegal activities before being contained by the Foundation.

Attempts to identify the origin of DSC-MATE-7545's unique features have been unsuccessful. It is still unknown whether DSC-MATE-7545 has the ability to act on its own accord or if it requires direction. As such, testing with DSC-MATE-7545 is considered high-risk and must be approved by the Ethics Committee.
