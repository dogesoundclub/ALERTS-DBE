Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5087 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber, designed to resemble a typical forest habitat. Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that DSC-MATE-5087 remains inside its designated containment area as it has a tendency to wander outside if left unchecked. An audio system emitting calming noises, mimicking the noises of a jungle, should be installed to ensure the psychological well-being of DSC-MATE-5087.

Description: DSC-MATE-5087, also known as "The Traffic Officer," is a male monkey of an unknown species. It is approximately 60 cm in height and weighs around 25 kg. Its face features a permanently frightened mouth, and its eyes are not distinguishable as it often wears sunglasses. DSC-MATE-5087 is often seen wearing a doge hat on its head, and a silver chain around its neck.

DSC-MATE-5087 has exhibited an exceptionally empathetic and compassionate personality, often going out of its way to help those around it. However, this tendency to take on other people's problems as its own has led DSC-MATE-5087 to feel overly burdened and responsible for fixing everything and everyone around it. This can be both admirable and exhausting for DSC-MATE-5087 as it often projects its issues onto others.

DSC-MATE-5087 exhibits a high level of intelligence and reasoning, capable of understanding and following simple instructions. However, due to its compassionate nature, it can sometimes be unpredictable, and its actions may not always align with instructions given to it.

History: DSC-MATE-5087 was discovered by Foundation agents in a traffic incident on a busy highway. It was observed attempting to regulate traffic movements and manage the flow of cars. After being recovered, DSC-MATE-5087was taken to a Foundation facility for further examination and containment. DSC-MATE-5087's empathy towards drivers and its desire to alleviate traffic has led to it being trained as a traffic officer at the Foundation's urban facilities.

DSC-MATE-5087's containment chamber has been designed to resemble a typical forest habitat. The area has been equipped with trees, rocks, and a river, imitating the natural environment of its species to ensure its psychological well-being.

Addendum: The Foundation has noted that when DSC-MATE-5087 is allowed to venture out of its containment chamber, it will often wander out onto the street, attempting to direct traffic flow. Due to the high probability of anomalous sightings, DSC-MATE-5087's outings require prior approval from a Level 3 or above personnel.
