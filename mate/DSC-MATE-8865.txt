SCP-8865, also known as "The Mechanic", is a female human with striking orange stripes on her forehead, creating a notable contrast with her otherwise fair complexion. Her purple lips give her a mischievous air, but her blue clown eyes are what truly stand out, conveying a sense of depth and mystery. Donning a jade earring on her left ear and a gold chain around her neck, she exudes an unexplainable charm that leaves others feeling both uneasy and captivated.

Despite her alluring appearance, SCP-8865's forgetfulness and absent-mindedness can often create complications. As a mechanically inclined individual, she is prone to losing herself in her work, losing track of time, and forgetting appointments or obligations. However, when focused, SCP-8865's talent presents itself in the form of exceptional craftsmanship, able to work seemingly impossible feats of engineering with ease.

The Mechanic's spontaneous nature and careless demeanour may be masked by her charming personality, but her abilities to manipulate and fix even the most complex of arcane technologies has earned her a place among the Foundation's extended network of paranormal experts. While SCP-8865's presence at times may be unorthodox, her proficiency has earned her a place within the ranks of the SCP Foundation.
