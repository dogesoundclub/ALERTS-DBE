Item #: SCP-8118

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8118 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and monitored at all times. Under no circumstances is SCP-8118 to be allowed access to any weapons or dangerous materials. Any communication with SCP-8118 is to be handled by trained Foundation personnel, and all interactions are to be conducted with utmost caution.

Description: SCP-8118 is a human male identified as the current leader of a powerful mafia organization. SCP-8118's most notable physical features are orange stripes on its face and a frightened mouth. SCP-8118 also wears nerdy glasses, a jade earring, a silver chain, and carries a candy stick as its preferred accessory.

SCP-8118 exhibits a highly scattered and forgetful personality, often getting sidetracked and forgetful of important appointments. SCP-8118's behavior can lead to humorous situations, but it is important to note that SCP-8118 is still highly dangerous due to its position as a mafia boss. Any attempts at humor or levity in its presence should be avoided.

SCP-8118's anomalous properties are currently unknown, but it has exhibited a highly charismatic and persuasive personality. It is suggested that SCP-8118 may possess some form of mind-control ability, although this is yet to be confirmed.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8118 was found attempting to negotiate a business deal with a local Foundation-friendly businessman. Despite the potential threat, SCP-8118 was cooperative with Foundation personnel and agreed to return to containment peacefully. Further investigation into SCP-8118's abilities and motives is ongoing.
