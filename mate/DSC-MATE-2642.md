ID # : DSC-MATE-2642
Description: 2642 appears to be a security guard model robot, made of sturdy metal alloys and primarily colored red with yellow and black accents. The head is a flashing alarm light and the eyes are made of ski goggles, granting excellent visual capabilities. Strangely, 2642 wears a gold chain around its neck, a fashion choice that seems to carry some significance for its command protocols.
