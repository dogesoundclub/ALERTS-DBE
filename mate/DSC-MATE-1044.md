Item #: DSC-MATE-1044

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1044 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. DSC-MATE-1044 is permitted access to books, music and movies. Personnel are prohibited from discussing political or social issues with DSC-MATE-1044.

Description: DSC-MATE-1044 is a male human, approximately 35 years old with spots on his face and a friendly smile. He wears nerd glasses over his hazel eyes and a red scarf around his neck. DSC-MATE-1044 has a two-color band on his forehead and a medical mask covering his mouth. He has a green cross earring in his left ear.

DSC-MATE-1044 has a strong desire to make the world a better place, often protesting or boycotting companies and causes that he perceives as being against his values. DSC-MATE-1044 has a very idealistic personality and is easily outraged by perceived injustices in the world. This can sometimes lead to humorous situations, such as when he boycotted a coffee shop because their cups were not environmentally friendly.

DSC-MATE-1044's profession is that of a train driver. Despite the positive impact of his job on the environment (using less fuel per passenger than cars, for example), DSC-MATE-1044 refused to work for a private railway company, instead choosing to be employed by a state-owned railway company. DSC-MATE-1044 believes that the transport of people and goods should be controlled by the state, which he thinks would make things more equal and fair.

DSC-MATE-1044's blood and tissue samples have been found to be unremarkable. His anomalous properties are entirely psychological.

Addendum: Starting from Incident 1044-01, any attempts of discussing in DSC-MATE-1044 with social and/or political problems should be considered as breach of containment protocols, resulting in disciplinary action.
