REPORT ON ANOMALOUS ENTITY 4184

Identification number: 4184
Job: Villain
Species: Monkey
Sex: Male

Description:

SCP-4184 appears to be a humanoid monkey, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. Its most prominent features are its red clown eyes, which give it an unnerving appearance even when it is not directly engaging with others. SCP-4184 also possesses a doge hat on its head, a red scarf around its neck, and a candy stick held in one hand. The entity's mouth is usually perpetually frightened, despite its villainous role.

SCP-4184's forehead features a two-color band that is thought to hold some significance in its culture or tradition. The entity's gold earring serves as another example of its attachment to tradition, but its definition remains unclear.

Personality:

SCP-4184 possesses a unique personality that, while no-nonsense at times, also reveals a playful side, often using humor to disarm potential threats. The entity holds a strong respect for its family or community's values and traditions and, as such, is likely to become hostile if they are threatened or violated.

Containment:

Due to SCP-4184's villainous nature, it is to be kept in a secure, humanoid containment cell at all times. Non-essential personnel are prohibited from directly interacting with SCP-4184 except under controlled circumstances. Any attempt to remove SCP-4184 from its containment cell or to interfere with its cultural and traditional beliefs will result in severe security action.

SCP-4184 is to remain in Foundation custody until it is ascertained that it can be released safely into the general population without causing harm or danger.
