ID # : DSC-MATE-4846
Description: 4846 is a female human with distinct features. She bears orange stripes on her face - an abnormality that seems to be somehow integrated with her personality. Her eyes are an unnerving shade of VR Jade LED, and her head is short and reminiscent of a witch. She wears a surgical mask over the lower half of her face, though it's unclear whether this is for hygiene or strategic purposes. She is consistently seen wearing a gold earring and a choker around her neck.
