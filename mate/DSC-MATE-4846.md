Item #: 4846

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identified as a mild-mannered fashion designer by day, 4846's true nature is a concerning enigma. Although considered harmless until provoked, all personnel must maintain a minimum of 5-meter distance from the subject at all times. Any attempts at physical contact or emotional provocation must be avoided at all costs.

Description: 4846 is a female human with distinct features. She bears orange stripes on her face - an abnormality that seems to be somehow integrated with her personality. Her eyes are an unnerving shade of VR Jade LED, and her head is short and reminiscent of a witch. She wears a surgical mask over the lower half of her face, though it's unclear whether this is for hygiene or strategic purposes. She is consistently seen wearing a gold earring and a choker around her neck.

As for her personality, 4846 is curious yet emotional. She possesses a remarkable sense of empathy for others, causing her to sympathize deeply with those in pain. This empathy occasionally leads to emotional outbursts, from teary-eyed sadness to fits of rage. Her fondness for animals and nature is another personality trait to note. Despite her peculiarities, 4846 functions well in society and is well respected in her profession.

Addendum: Dr. █████ has proposed launching an investigation into 4846's unique features and their implications as to her underlying nature. The proposal is currently under review by the O5 Council.
