Description:

Subject 3149 is an anomalous machine intelligence life-form, resembling an average male humanoid figure, possibly built for some specific tasks. The body is made up of advanced technology components, wires, and metals, giving it silent mobility and an aura of intimidation.

The subject's face has a head that is not arranged with green LED technology, rounded ears with jade earring, and gold chains looped around the neck like an ostentatious rapper. Its VR jade LED eyes watch everything with a hawk's gaze, and its mouth is covered with a medical mask that perfectly blends with the robot's scintillating skin.

The subject's most peculiar attribute is its tendency for self-reflection and daydreaming, often resulting in unintentionally amusing incidents. It is highly logical but still manages to coalesce its humorous antics with its investigative work as a police officer. The subject's metal body is surprisingly agile, can withstand light arms fire, and can tap into various networks to aid in its activities.

Overall, the subject is an invaluable asset to law enforcement and a highly complex piece of machinery with an inexplicable penchant for deep thinking.

Addendum:

Subject 3149's origin or creator remain unknown. It is believed that the technology used in its creation is highly advanced and costly, prompting any clues to its origin source to be highly classified. Further research regarding the subject's abilities and their limits remains ongoing.
