SCP Foundation Description Log 8813:

Identification number 8813 is a human with striking orange stripes on their face, offset by a mischievous smile. Their head is a lustrous metal blue, with a pair of goggles sitting perched on their forehead. They sport a bold gold chain accessory, serving as a testament to their confidence and self-assurance.

Hailing from the city streets, 8813 works as a Traffic Officer, often seen strutting about their duties with an air of nonchalance. But beware, for this individual is not without their flaws. They can be a bit reckless and may have a tendency to act before they think things through, leading to minor accidents and disasters - all in the name of impressing others.

Though they appear to live life on the edge, their endearing personality ensures that they always manage to keep those around them charmed and entertained, no matter the situation. As with every SCP, they must be monitored and kept in check, for their behavior can prove unpredictable and even dangerous at times.
