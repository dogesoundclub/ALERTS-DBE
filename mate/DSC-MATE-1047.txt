Item #: 1047

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #1047, known to the public as Traffic Officer Tom Michaels, is to be monitored constantly and kept under surveillance at all times. Due to his human nature, he is permitted daily activities such as eating, drinking, and sleeping. However, any unauthorized attempts at escape or breach of containment must be immediately reported to the higher-ups. His access to firearms and other weapons must be strictly limited and monitored at all times.

Description: Item #1047 appears as an ordinary human male, approximately 6 feet tall, with a broad build and a no-nonsense, traditional appearance. His most prominent physical features include a Mouth Spot on his upper lip, VR Rainbow LED eyes, and a Blue Bandana wrapped around his head. He also wears a Green Cross Earring on his right ear as well as a Silver Chain and Cigarette as accessories.

Personality: Item #1047 exhibits a strong respect for tradition and a no-nonsense attitude in his job as a Traffic Officer. He takes his role seriously and enforces the law with conviction. However, he also possesses a playful side, often entertaining others with jokes and stories passed down from his family or community. His unpredictable nature can lead to humorous situations, but it is important to remember that he is still considered a potential threat to public safety.

Addendum: Item #1047 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports surfaced of traffic violations being resolved in a supernatural manner. Upon initial contact, Item #1047 had claimed his abilities were a result of his cultural beliefs and magical rituals passed down through generations in his family. Further investigation revealed that his behavior and abilities were not consistent with previously encountered humans, leading to his containment as an anomaly.
