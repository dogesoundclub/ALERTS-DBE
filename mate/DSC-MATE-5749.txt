Item #: SCP-5749

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5749 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. As the subject is a sapient supernatural entity, all personnel interacting with SCP-5749 must maintain a professional demeanor at all times to avoid triggering emotional feedback. 

SCP-5749 is to be provided with an ample supply of books, puzzles, and other forms of entertainment to keep the entity engaged. Access to live performances, including theater productions and musical concerts, is also permitted but must be monitored at all times. 

Description: SCP-5749 appears to be a male tiger sporting a purple cap with a headset, accentuated by a red cross earring on the left ear, and with a red scarf that is worn over a standard medical mask to obscure their facial features. The entity's eyes are covered by thick nerd glasses, and a goggle rests on their forehead. SCP-5749 is identified as a theater manager, although there is no known theater under their direction.

SCP-5749 possesses the ability to manifest objects out of thin air through some unknown method, often producing books, candy, or puzzle games to keep themselves entertained. There have been instances where the entity has displayed anomalous control over live performances, directing the actors and musicians with precise instructions, leading to entire acts being reorchestrated or scenes reworked.

Personality: SCP-5749 is highly empathetic and compassionate, often taking on the problems of others as their own. The entity will go to great lengths to help individuals, even if it means putting themselves in harm's way. SCP-5749 tends to become deeply invested in those they are helping and may display a strong emotional response when their assistance is declined.

The entity embraces their role in managing a theater, seeking to inspire and uplift those around them through the power of the arts. SCP-5749 has a particular fondness for the works of William Shakespeare, and will often quote his plays while offering words of encouragement. 

Conclusion: SCP-5749 presents a unique challenge for containment due to the entity's strong emotional response to the world around them. Personnel interacting with SCP-5749 must take great care to avoid negatively impacting the entity's emotional state. Nonetheless, the entity's powers and abilities could be incredibly useful to the Foundation, especially in matters requiring a creative approach.
