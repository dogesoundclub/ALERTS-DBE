Item #: SCP-2737

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2737 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any requests made by SCP-2737 must first be reviewed and approved by the on-duty supervisor. SCP-2737 is allowed to continue its employment as Theater Manager, however, all incoming shows should be pre-approved by the Foundation to avoid any potential containment breaches.

Description: SCP-2737 is a male robot with a theater manager job. SCP-2737's head features green hair in a purple cap and wears normal glasses. SCP-2737's ears are adorned with a jade earring and wears a red scarf.

SCP-2737's personality is characterized as highly organized and detail-oriented. SCP-2737 tends to be methodical and purposeful in all actions, but occasionally displays a sudden, irrational side that leads to humorous situations such as impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit.

SCP-2737's spontaneous behavior has raised concerns regarding its potential ability to manipulate individuals, and the Foundation has requested further testing on this matter.

Addendum: SCP-2737 has requested an extension of its employment contract in the theater, citing its passion for the arts and deep connections with the surrounding community. After review and approval by the on-duty supervisor, the request has been granted.
