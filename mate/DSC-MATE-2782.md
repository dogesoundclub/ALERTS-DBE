DSC-MATE-2782, also known as "The Metalhead", is a peculiar human real estate agent that possesses a highly detail-oriented personality. Upon initial observation, DSC-MATE-2782 appears unremarkable, adorned with a pair of nerd glasses and a golden chain.

DSC-MATE-2782 is known to meticulously alphabetize everything, from his spice rack to his closet, making sure every single detail is in order. Such behavior seems to feed into DSC-MATE-2782's fascination with metal music, often using his real estate agent persona to help find appropriate venues for local bands around the city.

Despite DSC-MATE-2782's harmless appearance and day-job, multiple anomalous events have been reported to coincide with his movements.
