Description: SCP-6619 is a female, human politician with distinct facial features, including spots and a constant smile. SCP-6619 wears normal glasses, layered silver chain, and a jade earring on each ear. The head of SCP-6619 is green with an edge curl, an anomaly that has yet to be explained. SCP-6619 is always seen wearing a normal gas mask to prevent any form of pollutants or diseases that affect the lungs.

SCP-6619 is highly organized and structured, presenting herself as a well-oiled machine. With a tendency to be a little too controlling, SCP-6619 often delegates tasks and takes the lead in projects or events. SCP-6619 has shown a reputation for getting things done, regardless of any obstacles, which is why they are a popular public figure.

SCP-6619's mandatory physicals have shown no abnormal patterns or physiological structures besides the green hue of the skin, and the hair color is similar to chlorophyll, a distinctive green pigment found in plants. SCP-6619 has not shown any durability outside of that of a regular human.

Addendum: Upon requested interviews to understand the origin of SCP-6619's physical appearance and green hair, SCP-6619 refused to give any information, stating that it was unnecessary and irrelevant to her political career. All interview requests were denied afterwards. Research is ongoing to determine the origin of SCP-6619's anomalous features.
