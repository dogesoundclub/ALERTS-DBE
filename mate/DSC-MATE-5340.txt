Item #: SCP-5340

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5340 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. She must be provided with a headset with LED and given ample opportunities to smoke cigarettes. The goggles found on her forehead are not to be removed at any cost. She must avoid contact with any other SCPs and vaccination against any airborne diseases is mandatory.

Description: SCP-5340 is a female humanoid of human species. She has orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Her eyesight is normal, but wears glasses for protection. She carries herself with a gold chain and is almost always seen with a cigarette in her hand.

SCP-5340 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. She displays exceptional wit and engages in activities that create light-hearted situations. SCP-5340 is frequently seen telling funny stories or performing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Such activities may hinder her focus, but SCP-5340 is capable of performing her duties as a Doctor flawlessly.

During the initial containment procedures, it was observed that the goggles on SCP-5340â€™s forehead may have an anomalous effect, which needs further observation. SCP-5340 claims that the goggles help her see beyond the visible light spectrum.

Addendum: SCP-5340 has proven to be an excellent Doctor and has displayed exceptional skills in treating anomalies. Her wit and humor may pose a hindrance, but SCP-5340 has been instrumental in calming down distressed SCPs.
