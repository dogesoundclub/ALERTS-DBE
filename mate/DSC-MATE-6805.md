Item #: 6805

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6805 is to be monitored daily by Foundation agents to ensure that its status remains stable. DSC-MATE-6805's humanoid form and legal profession requires that it interacts with the outside world. Therefore, it is allowed to continue its job while wearing a specially designed camouflage to prevent attracting unwanted attention.

Description: DSC-MATE-6805 appears as an average human male with orange stripes on his face and a red victory band on his forehead. He wears normal glasses and a gold earring on both ears. His most notable feature is his constant smiling expression. DSC-MATE-6805 is usually seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-6805 is prone to forgetfulness and easily gets sidetracked, often causing humorous situations such as getting lost and missing important appointments. However, when he is focused, DSC-MATE-6805 is an excellent lawyer, and his clients often speak highly of him.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6805 came to the attention of the Foundation after a report was filed about a lawyer who could remember every detail about their clients except their names. The Foundation monitored DSC-MATE-6805 and deemed him safe for continued outside interaction.
