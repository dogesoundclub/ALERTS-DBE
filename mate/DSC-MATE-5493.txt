Item #: SCP-5493

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5493 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with ample space for movement. The cell should be equipped with a high-voltage electric fence and a neural scrambler to deter any escape attempts.

Under no circumstances are staff members to initiate communication with SCP-5493, lest they are wearing a Class D Hazmat suit.

Description: SCP-5493 is a male monkey identified as an electrician, weighing approximately 15 kilograms. SCP-5493 exhibits noticeable facial features such as a frightened mouth, an expression in its eyes implying fear and anxiety.

SCP-5493 sports a unique appearance, wearing a police cap, a jade earring on each ear, a red scarf around its neck, and a LED gas mask over its mouth.

SCP-5493 has been confirmed to exhibit self-awareness, tool use ability and has shown the intelligence of a trained electrician. However, SCP-5493’s ability to control and manipulate electronic objects is considered unusual and potentially dangerous.

SCP-5493’s personality is described as quirky and humorous. SCP-5493 uses humor to distract and deceive from its true intentions.

SCP-5493 has shown a tendency to tamper with electronic equipment within its reach, resulting in unexpected and anomalous effects. Its behavior should be considered a significant hazard to the Foundation's security.

Addendum: After Incident 5493-L4, SCP-5493's containment procedures have been updated with the required use of Class D Hazmat suits for staff approaching the containment area. Inquiries into SCP-5493's origins are still ongoing.
