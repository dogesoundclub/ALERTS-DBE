Item #: 1185

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1185 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a single bed, a desk, and a chair. They are to be allowed to keep their personal belongings, including their gold chain and candy stick. SCP-1185 is to be allowed access to writing materials, craft supplies, and any other materials they may request for creative purposes.

Description: SCP-1185 is a male human with unique facial features. Their skin has multiple spots, and they exhibit a frightened expression at all times, resulting in a perpetually open mouth. Their eyes resemble ski goggles, and they often wear a police cap and a jade earring. SCP-1185 works as a beautician when not contained.

SCP-1185 exhibits a highly imaginative personality, often involved in creative hobbies and interests. They enjoy writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. SCP-1185's personality can contribute to their ability to manipulate reality through the power of suggestion, which they use purposely to create costumes and makeup that have an almost magical effect on their customers. This has led to several people being brought to the Foundation for monitoring and containment.

SCP-1185's gold chain and candy stick possess anomalous properties, with the candy stick being able to distort the perceptions of those who ingest them. These items are a potential threat to the security of the Foundation, and as such, SCP-1185 is to be continually monitored during access to these items.

SCP-1185 has not shown any violent tendencies and is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, due to the risks posed by their anomalous abilities, SCP-1185 is to be contained indefinitely.
