Item #: SCP-2281

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2281 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-2281 is to be strictly limited to authorized personnel with Level-2 security clearance. SCP-2281 is allowed to continue with its profession as a fashion designer, but all clothing produced by SCP-2281 must be inspected for potential anomalous properties before being sold to the public.

Description: SCP-2281 is a human male with a distinctive mouth spot on his upper lip and frequently displays a frightened expression. SCP-2281 wears prescription nerd glasses and a jade earring in their right ear. Additionally, SCP-2281 can often be seen with a cigarette in their hand.

SCP-2281 is highly observant and attentive to details, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, this perfectionism can lead to excessive amounts of time spent selecting the "perfect" gift for someone. SCP-2281 has occasionally exhibited anomalous properties in relation to their gift-giving tendencies.

SCP-2281 is capable of sensing the emotional state of an individual and can create clothing items imbued with anomalous properties that match or enhance that emotional state. These anomalous properties can range from boosting confidence to inducing feelings of despair or fear in the wearer.

SCP-2281's abilities appear to be subconscious, with SCP-2281 unaware of any control over their gift-giving beyond their usual meticulousness. The Foundation is monitoring SCP-2281 for any further anomalous properties or abilities.
