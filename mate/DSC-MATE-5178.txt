Subject 5178 is a curious case, an ordinary-looking human with a peculiar penchant for organization. Their visual features are striking, with spots dotting their skin and a medical mask hiding their mouth. They don a purple cap and headset, likely as part of their job as a news anchor, and wear gold earrings that glint in the light. Beyond their physical appearance, it is their personality that sets them apart. 5178 is obsessed with detail, taking pride in their ability to alphabetize their spice rack or color-code their closet. While seemingly harmless, this trait could prove useful in uncovering the smallest of details others may overlook. Approach with caution, as there is more to this seemingly ordinary human than meets the eye.
