Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9524 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not on duty as a firefighter. Any requests for impromptu activities or party planning must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-9524's medical mask must be maintained and replaced as necessary to prevent the spread of disease. Any unapproved removal of the mask will result in immediate quarantine.

Description: SCP-9524 is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on their face and purple lips. Their orange eyebrows and brown hair styled in a 90s fashion are also noteworthy features. SCP-9524 has a two-color band on their forehead and wears a gold earring and chain as accessories.

SCP-9524 is a firefighter by profession and has demonstrated typical human physical capabilities. However, their spontaneous side and tendency towards planning can lead to unpredictable behavior, which poses a risk to containment protocols. SCP-9524 has a reputation among their coworkers for surprising them with impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit.

SCP-9524 has yet to exhibit any anomalous abilities or behaviors beyond their noted appearance and personality. However, their disregard for authority and tendency for spontaneity warrant close monitoring.

Addendum: On 20██, SCP-9524 requested approval for an impromptu parade involving the emergency vehicles at their station. Despite hesitation from Level 3 personnel, the event was approved, and SCP-9524's enthusiasm was contagious. The event was well-received by the local community and raised morale among the firefighters. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of SCP-9524's ability to influence social situations.
