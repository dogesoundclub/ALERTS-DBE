Item #: 4401

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4401 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to electronic devices and the internet shall be provided for the subject's programming needs, but otherwise denied. Any interaction with mechanical or electronic objects outside of work must be monitored to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject and the objects. Subject must be provided with a standard gas mask for safety measures.

Description: Subject 4401 is a humanoid female of the species Homo sapiens. The subject is 5'6" and has distinctive facial features, including purple lips and green-edged curls. The subject's green skin and cross earrings are abnormal, yet appear natural for the subject. Subject carries a gas mask as part of fashion choice, but often uses it to protect themselves from any potentially dangerous chemicals.

Subject 4401 is a highly skilled programmer and is very caring towards both animate and inanimate objects. They frequently give names to their car, talk to plants, and even anthropomorphize their household appliances. The subject displays no signs of malicious intent towards their surroundings or fellow staff, and seems to be a valuable asset for any programming team they work with.

Addendum: Subject 4401's ability to anthropomorphize inanimate objects has led to several unusual incidents, including the "awakening" of an abandoned server, and the discovery of a "sentient" printer. While such events should not pose a direct danger, caution must be exercised in case of any unexpected consequences.
