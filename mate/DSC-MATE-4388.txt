SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-4388

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4388 must be monitored at all times through close-quarters observation, as well as remote surveillance. Communication with SCP-4388 is restricted to Foundation personnel with Level-3 clearance or higher. Any communication must take place in a soundproofed chamber to prevent her voice from being overheard by unauthorised individuals. In the event of a containment breach, administration of Class A amnestics is both mandatory and sufficient.

Description: SCP-4388 is a human female of approximately 25-30 years of age, with orange stripes covering her face as a distinguishing feature. Despite her mundanity, SCP-4388 presents several peculiarities that can be considered anomalous. She exhibits characteristics similar to those of an empath and has a profound understanding of human emotions. SCP-4388 is deeply affected by the pain and suffering of others, and has been known to experience emotional outbursts and cry when exposed to their emotions. Additionally, SCP-4388 appears to possess a strong bond with animals and nature.

SCP-4388 is an urban delivery driver who drives for various businesses and courier services; however, the exact locations and businesses remain classified. SCP-4388 has been observed to transport anomalous packages and parcels, often without her knowledge. It is unknown whether SCP-4388 is aware of the anomalous nature of these packages, or if she is being deliberately used to transport anomalous materials. This presents a potential security risk to the Foundation.

Addendum: During a series of routine surveillance operations, SCP-4388 was observed wearing a choker around her neck, which seemed to emit a low-level electromagnetic field. The purpose of this device remains unknown, and further investigation is required. SCP-4388 has also been seen wearing a hoodie that obscures part of her face, which is in violation of delivery driver dress codes. The hoodie appears to obstruct any attempts at facial recognition, and its material seems to be resistant to various forms of analysis.

SCP-4388 is considered cooperative and poses no immediate danger. Given her potential exposure to anomalous entities and objects, her containment is essential for the protection of the Foundation and the wider public.
