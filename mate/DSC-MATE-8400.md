Item #: DSC-MATE-8400

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8400 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Adequate firefighting equipment should be made available for its use, as its employment as a firefighter is part of its containment.

DSC-MATE-8400 is not to be allowed to smoke within the facility, and any attempts to do so should be met with disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-8400 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. It appears to be of a typical build for a humanoid of its height and weight, aside from its characteristic rabbit ears and teeth, as well as sporting a blue bandana tied around its head and a gold earring on one of its ears.

DSC-MATE-8400 is employed as a firefighter at a local fire station, and during its time in containment, it has shown a high level of proficiency in firefighting procedures and use of firefighting equipment. Its speech patterns and behavior are consistent with a human male of its age and profession, though it has been noted to possess a dry sense of humor that often catches other individuals off guard.

DSC-MATE-8400 is known to carry a cigarette with it at all times, though it has been informally warned against smoking within the facility. Its preference for smoking has been noted to cause irritation among some staff members, as well as a potential fire hazard.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8400 was recovered from a local fire station after an incident in which it was witnessed by several members of the public putting out a fire unassisted, using a fire hose meant for human use. DSC-MATE-8400 was cooperative during its transfer to Foundation custody and was found to possess no anomalous properties outside of its rabbit-like appearance and smoking habits.

Despite repeated requests from DSC-MATE-8400 to return to its position as a firefighter, it has been informed that containment is necessary for the protection of public safety.
