Item #: 6005

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6005 is to be monitored at all times through remote observation systems. Any changes in behavior or physical appearance must be reported immediately to the supervising agent in charge of the case. Subject 6005 is designated as a low-level anomaly and poses no immediate threat to the public. As such, they are permitted to work and study normally under the supervision of Foundation agents posing as coworkers and classmates.

Description: 

Subject 6005 is a humanoid male with distinctive features that set him apart from the general populace. The most notable of which is the Mouth Spot located above his lips. The spot seems to be harmless, and no anomalous effects have been observed from it. However, mundane individuals may find it unsettling or off-putting. Another strange aspect of his appearance is the frightened expression that often appears on his face, even when not in danger. Repeated attempts to alleviate this fear have not been successful. 

Subject 6005's eyes are an unusual shade of green and appear to be artificial. Careful examination reveals that they are VR Jade LED, which enable him to interface with virtual reality systems in ways that are beyond the capabilities of a normal human. Furthermore, the subject has a mohawk that runs from the top of his head to the nape of his neck. The hair is naturally black, and it is believed that he styles it himself.

Subject 6005 wears a jade earring in his left ear, which has been observed to resonate with certain occult artifacts, suggesting he may have been exposed to anomalous objects or entities. As a safety precaution, he is required to wear a normal gas mask when entering areas identified as hazardous by the Foundation.

Personality:

Subject 6005 is known to have an insatiable curiosity about the world and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others. Despite this, he can become easily overwhelmed when presented with overwhelming amounts of information. His fear is sometimes his greatest ally, as it keeps him from diving too deeply into dangerous or forbidden subjects. 

Overall, Subject 6005 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, as his curiosity and ability to interface with digital systems has enabled him to learn more about other anomalies and how to contain them. His fear, while it may seem like a hindrance at first, often keeps him from causing dangerous situations, making him a reliable member of the team.
