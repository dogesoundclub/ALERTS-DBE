Item #: SCP-9563

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9563 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel are required to wear noise-cancellation headsets when engaging with SCP-9563 to avoid the risk of being drawn into its confessional anecdotes. Any non-authorized personnel found within SCP-9563's chamber are to be immediately removed and given Class-C amnestics.

Description: SCP-9563 is a male monkey, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall, wearing a retro cap, and a red scarf. SCP-9563's most notable feature is its nerdy glasses, while his other accessory, a green jade earring, is suspected to only be for aesthetic purposes. His frightened mannerisms are evident in SCP-9563's facial expression and body language.

SCP-9563 is a licensed beautician and has a charming personality, able to easily establish rapport with anyone, regardless of their personality. SCP-9563's contagiously jovial personality makes him an effective confidant, and a threat to the Foundation's security.

SCP-9563 has the anomalous ability to make anyone within a 10-meter radius feel comfortable to share their life stories and darkest confessions. It's rumoured that SCP-9563's charms have even been effective on the Foundation personnel.

Addendum 9563-1: SCP-9563 was discovered on the streets of ██████, under surveillance from the GOC. SCP-9563's manipulative personality was deemed too dangerous to be at large, and SCP-9563 was eventually captured and transferred to Site-██. Despite being told repeatedly, SCP-9563 continues to claim that he was transforming animals into humans and performing beauty treatments on them.

Addendum 9563-2: Personnel interacting with SCP-9563 have reported several changes in their behaviour, including a sudden urge to divulge their darkest secrets or compulsive behaviour to please SCP-9563. All interactions are to be kept brief, and personnel are cautioned against developing any emotional attachments to the entity. Any deviation from these procedures may result in disciplinary action.
