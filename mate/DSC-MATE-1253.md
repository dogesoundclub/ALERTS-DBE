DSC-MATE-1253 is to be monitored at all times and in the event of a breach, a team of armed guards shall be deployed immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-1253 is a male tiger, sporting blue clown eyes and a blue bandana on its head. Its left ear is pierced with a jade earring and its mouth is always covered by a medical mask. DSC-MATE-1253 is known to possess an anomalous ability to control and manipulate flames, making it an extremely useful asset to the Foundation in cases of fire-based anomalies.

DSC-MATE-1253's personality is unusual in that it possesses a dry sense of humor, often catching others off guard. While DSC-MATE-1253 may not consider itself the life of the party, it has a unique way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly humorous. Researchers who've worked with DSC-MATE-1253 report that its sense of humor and quips have a mild memetic effect, leading them to develop an attachment to the tiger and risking potential breaches in containment.

Addendum 1253-1: Incident Report

On [REDACTED], DSC-MATE-1253 was dispatched to a fire-related incident outside DSC-173's containment unit. Due to the volatile nature of DSC-173, all personnel were immediately put on high alert. DSC-MATE-1253, however, managed to calm the flames and contain the situation with remarkable ease. During a debrief, DSC-MATE-1253 joked that it was only fair that the Foundation invested in a "fire-resistant peanut butter jar" to contain DSC-173; this caused significant stress among the attending researchers.

Whilst DSC-MATE-1253's ability to defuse a potentially catastrophic situation was appreciated, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring DSC-MATE-1253's behavior and the influence it can have on those around it.
