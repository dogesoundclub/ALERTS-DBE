Item #: SCP-4602

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4602 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-4602 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-4602 is to be allowed access to writing utensils and paper for the purpose of record keeping. Any attempt of SCP-4602 to gift anyone outside of Foundation personnel must be intercepted and secured.

Description: SCP-4602 appears to be a standard human female, with the exception of a few distinct features. SCP-4602 wears a gold chain and a pair of jade earrings. She also has purple lip color and orange eyebrow color. On her blonde hair, SCP-4602 usually wears a ushanka with a two-color band. SCP-4602 works as a banker in ████████ City, and has exhibited no anomalous activity at her workplace.

SCP-4602 displays an obsession with gift giving to others, to the point where not being able to give a gift can cause severe distress. SCP-4602 spends an extensive amount of time and resources researching and acquiring the 'perfect' gift for each recipient. This behavior comes from SCP-4602's ability to observe and attend to details, making her an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-4602 can become overly concerned with giving the 'perfect' gift, and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-4602 was discovered after reports from police suggested she had been giving unusual gifts to her colleagues. SCP agents were dispatched to investigate, transporting SCP-4602 to Site-██ for containment and study.

Addendum: SCP-4602 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel or any interest in escaping containment. As such, containment procedures are deemed effective. Research into the origin of SCP-4602's gift-giving behavior is ongoing.
