Item #: SCP-9149

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9149 is to be kept under constant surveillance and is to be allowed access to the news station for her scheduled broadcasts only. SCP-9149 is to be prevented from using social media or any form of communication that allows her to influence a large number of people. All recordings of her broadcasts are to undergo thorough analysis for any anomalous behavior.

Description: SCP-9149 is a human female serving as a news anchor for a local news station. Her most notable feature is her orange-striped face and red lipstick, accompanied by blue clown eyes. She has a pair of goggles on her forehead and sports a red cross earring in her left ear. Her choice of accessories includes a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-9149's primary anomalous ability is her outgoing and social personality, which can cause her to become the center of attention. SCP-9149 has a penchant for telling jokes and stories so funny that it results in uncontrollable laughter among her listeners. She has the ability to influence people's moods and opinions, making her a potential danger to the general public.

SCP-9149's exposure to SCP-████ has resulted in a noticeable amplification of her abilities. As such, she is to be kept away from all known SCP anomalies that have the potential to enhance her anomalous abilities.

SCP-9149 was discovered after several reports surfaced of anomalous behavior during her news broadcasts. Foundation agents were able to confirm the anomalous nature of SCP-9149's abilities and retrieved her from the news station.

Addendum: During observation, SCP-9149 has demonstrated a level of awareness regarding her anomalous abilities. She has expressed a desire to be free from her containment and resume her normal life. Given the potential danger her abilities pose to the public, this is not possible at this time.
