Item#: 2298

Containment Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2298 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All computer systems within the containment area must be installed with a custom algorithm so as to prevent any outside hacking attempts. No form of internet access should be granted to Item #2298 without explicit approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Item #2298 is a human male by the name of ██████ ███████. They are in their early 30s and stand at 5'11" tall with a slim build. The most notable features of the subject are their unique face markings - a spot on their lips, a constant smile, VR Rainbow LED for eyes, and a goggle on their forehead. They are known to wear a Gold Earring in their left ear at all times.

The subject has a tendency for detail-orientation which expresses itself in odd ways like alphabetizing spice racks or color-coding clothing closets. Item #2298 employs a very systematic approach when it comes to processing information and can think through complex problems in a logical manner with relative ease. They also tend to speak and write more formally, often using technical terms and long words.

Personnel interacting with Item #2298 have reported feeling an unusual sense of calm and trust when engaging with them. Their calm demeanor often creates a relaxing and productive work environment, and their thorough approach ensures that a task is completed to the highest standards. However, it is important to note that their attention to detail can lead to moments where they may become irritable, restless, and anxious. 

Addendum: During testing, it was observed that Item #2298 has a peculiar ability to visually augment reality with their VR Rainbow LED eyes. They have shown to be able to manipulate digital objects and even display AR models of complex designs they are working on. Further research is required to determine the extent of this ability and how it could be incorporated into secure task operations.
