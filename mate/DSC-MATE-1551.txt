Item #: 1551

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1551's whereabouts must be monitored at all times, with his movements tracked through GPS. Due to his reckless behavior, he should be kept away from public areas as much as possible to avoid any unnecessary incidents. All interactions with subject 1551 must be done in a controlled environment, as sudden movements or loud noises can trigger his primal instincts.

Description: Subject 1551 appears to be a male tiger in his mid-30s, standing at 6' 5" and weighing approximately 600 pounds. He has a pair of horned rim glasses perched on his nose and an earring in the shape of a red cross on his left ear. His forehead features a two-color band that runs from temple to temple, reminiscent of the traditional tiger stripes. The silver chain around his neck appears to be his only form of adornment, joined by a whistle that he often plays with when nervous.

Subject 1551's personality can be described as a mix of reckless and impulsive, with a tendency to act before thinking things through. His desire to impress others often leads him into dangerous situations, leading to minor accidents or mishaps. In more controlled environments, he tends to be more calm and collected, often using his natural charisma to charm others.

Addendum: Several incidents have been reported involving subject 1551, including a car crash and a brawl at a local bar. Despite his tendency for reckless behavior, he has yet to display any signs of hostility towards human beings, and it is recommended that he be treated with caution rather than aggression. All field agents must carry a tranquilizer gun when dealing with subject 1551.
