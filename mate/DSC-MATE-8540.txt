Item #: 8540

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8540 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a traffic officer. She must wear her purple cap with a headset and green cross earring at all times during her shift. No contact with inanimate objects is allowed during duty hours.

Description: Subject 8540 is a female human with prominent spots on her skin and a purple lip. Her red clown eyes are highly unusual for a human being, and she is often seen wearing a choker as an accessory. She has a highly unusual personality, often seen talking to her plants and naming her car. 

Subject 8540 possesses an anomalous property. Inanimate objects in close proximity to her become anthropomorphized, developing sentience and a consciousness of their own. This effect is not limited to any particular type of object and has been observed to occur with everything from household appliances to traffic lights.

Subject 8540 is highly empathetic and tends to exhibit nurturing behavior. This tendency extends beyond living creatures and includes her interactions with the anthropomorphized objects surrounding her. In order to prevent direct contact between Subject 8540 and inanimate objects during duty hours, she is equipped with a headset and a green cross earring as a reminder of her duty to humanity. 

Addendum: Due to the unpredictable nature of Subject 8540's anomalous effects, caution must be exercised when handling any objects within her proximity. It is recommended that all personnel in her vicinity be advised of her properties and trained on how to avoid activating her abilities. Additional measures for mitigating the effects of her powers are currently under review by Foundation researchers.
