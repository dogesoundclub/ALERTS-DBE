Item #: SCP-9382

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9382 (also known as "Tiger Firefighter") is to be housed within a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls and ceiling. A standard animal containment cell is to also be provided within this chamber. Access to this chamber is limited to Level 2 personnel or higher and must be approved by the site director.

SCP-9382's daily tasks must involve physically strenuous activities and should be supervised at all times. Medical staff must be present during these activities to monitor SCP-9382's physical condition.

SCP-9382 is allowed to wear his signature red beanie, red victory band on his forehead, red cross earring, and red scarf. The candy stick in his possession is to be replaced every week with a new one.

Description: SCP-9382 is a male tiger with a humanoid physique. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters tall, with orange and black fur that runs down its back to the tip of the tail. SCP-9382 has demonstrated advanced cognitive abilities and possesses significant physical strength.

SCP-9382 claims to be a firefighter and exhibits a high degree of confidence in managing emergency situations. However, SCP-9382 is easily distracted and often forgets important details leading to negligence during crucial moments.

Personality: SCP-9382 is generally friendly and playful, but its scatterbrained tendencies often lead to unintentional comedic moments. Therefore, much care is to be given when assigning it to critical missions. SCP-9382 has expressed regret after failing to respond efficiently to a recent emergency situation.

SCP-9382 has also shown an interest in reading human literature and, upon approval from the site director and senior staff, will be allowed to read books based on its current mental abilities.

Addendum: During an emergency call, SCP-9382 displayed a previously unknown trait, whereby it assumed a quadrupedal position and released an intense flame from its mouth toward the burning building. The heat output was estimated to be over 2,000 degrees Celsius. SCP-9382 seemed to sustain minimal burns during this occurrence, indicating a potential anomalous ability that is yet to be fully understood. Investigation is ongoing.
