SCP-6140, also known as "The Curious Chimp," is a male Monkey with horned rim glasses over his eyes and a retro cap on his head. His forehead features a unique two-color band that sets him apart from typical primates. Sporting a gold earring, gold chain, and cigarette, SCP-6140 is a real estate agent with a curious mind that seeks out obscure or unusual information. This curiosity often leads to unusual and humorous situations, where SCP-6140 will randomly spout off esoteric trivia and facts to those around him. Despite his often-humorous attitude, SCP-6140's intelligence cannot be underestimated, making him a valuable asset to any team. However, his tendency to get sidetracked and wander off-topic can prove distracting, requiring some amount of patience from those working alongside him.
