Item #: SCP-8665

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8665 is to be kept in a standard anomalous humanoid containment chamber at all times. All personnel interacting with SCP-8665 are advised to exercise caution, and must not approach within one meter of SCP-8665 at any time.

Description: SCP-8665 appears to be a male rabbit, standing at approximately 30 centimeters in height. It possesses red clown eyes that are capable of exerting a powerful hypnosis effect on anyone who makes direct eye contact with it. Additionally, SCP-8665 wears a hoodie at all times and accessorizes with a gold chain and a cigarette.

SCP-8665's most notable ability is its natural talent for leadership. It possesses a commanding presence that makes it easy for it to take charge of any group, be it at work, in social situations, or in personal life. Despite its small stature, SCP-8665 is also known for being incredibly intimidating.

Early tests have shown that SCP-8665 is capable of hypnotizing an individual within a 5-meter radius of it, and once under its influence, the individual is completely subservient to SCP-8665's will. At this time, it is unknown if SCP-8665 is capable of extending its influence beyond this range.

Addendum: SCP-8665 was first discovered working as a delivery driver for a local food delivery service. Its anomalous abilities were discovered after numerous reports of SCP-8665 using its abilities to control and manipulate customers, coworkers, and superiors. The Foundation stepped in and apprehended SCP-8665, transporting it to its current containment site. Further studies are currently ongoing to determine the full extent of SCP-8665's capabilities.
