SCP-206 has been observed attempting to complete multiple tasks simultaneously, leading to comical situations in which they struggle to carry or manage an excessive workload.

Observers have noted that SCP-206 appears to be completely unaware of their anomalous behavior, treating their tendencies as typical personality traits rather than potential symptoms of a psychological disorder. No medical or psychiatric concerns have been observed during SCP-206's time in containment.
