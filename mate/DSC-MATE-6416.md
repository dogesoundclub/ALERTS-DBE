Description: 

Subject 6416 is a female human with distinctive spots and a smile that can light up a room. Her odd blue clown eyes may enrage or discomfort subjects who unwillingly come in contact with them. Despite this, most subjects will be utterly entranced by her retro cap and the goggles that sit on her forehead.

Subject 6416's smart and organized nature make her an excellent veterinarian, but she also enjoys spur-of-the-moment decisions to liven up dull moments. From impromptu adventures to last-minute party planning, the subject can make any situation entertaining. This behavior may seem innocuous; however, it has to be watched to avoid mishaps at the facility.

The subject is entirely compliant with the standard safety protocols and has shown no signs of attempting any breach of containment. However, they do tend to push the boundaries of these protocols, which require close observation.

Addendum: A request made by the subject for a silver chain has been approved by the site manager.
