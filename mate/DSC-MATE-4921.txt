SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-4921

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4921 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any interaction with SCP-4921 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-4921 is a 35-year-old male fashion designer of Afro-Caribbean descent. SCP-4921's facial features include spots on the cheeks and a wide, infectious smile. SCP-4921's eyes resemble ski goggles, and he sports a brightly colored mohawk with a gold earring on his right ear. SCP-4921 often wears a gold chain around his neck and an LED gas mask.

SCP-4921 exhibits a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This often leads to humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations, to lighten the mood. However, SCP-4921 has been observed to become moody and aggressive when provoked or when his designs are criticized.

SCP-4921's anomalous properties manifest when he creates clothing or accessories. SCP-4921's designs have a memetic effect, causing anyone who wears or carries his creations to become increasingly narcissistic and vain. This effect intensifies the longer the subject wears or carries the item. Testing has shown that subjects who wear SCP-4921's creations for more than 24 hours show signs of delusions of grandeur and a complete detachment from reality.

Addendum: SCP-4921 was apprehended by Foundation agents after a spike in cases of individuals displaying irrational and erratic behavior that was traced back to clothing and accessories designed by SCP-4921.  SCP-4921 has since been contained and all of his designs have been confiscated and securely stored in Site-██.
