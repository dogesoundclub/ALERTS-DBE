SCP-7224 is a humanoid rabbit with a frighteningly timid mouth and eerie blue clown eyes. They stand at an average height of 5'8", with gold earrings protruding from their long, floppy ears. Their attire is often accessorized with a silver chain necklace and a candy stick, which they are incessantly munching on during broadcasts.

SCP-7224 worked as a news anchor before being discovered by the Foundation, where they displayed a wonderful aptitude for entertaining and informing the masses. Despite their apparent timidity, SCP-7224 has a great sense of humor and loves to make others laugh. This attitude has led to situations where they tell funny stories or do silly impersonations to lighten the mood, often to the delight of their colleagues.

SCP-7224's jovial demeanor has been known to affect even the most stoic members of the Foundation, causing them to let their guard down and join in the laughter. Despite their seemingly innocent persona, SCP-7224 is considered extremely valuable due to their ability to uplift morale and bring levity to otherwise grave situations.

Approach with caution, as SCP-7224's jovial mannerisms could potentially cloud one's judgment and compromise the mission at hand.
