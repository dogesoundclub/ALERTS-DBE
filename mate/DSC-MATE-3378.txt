Description: SCP-3378 is a humanoid entity of the female sex, identified as a reporter by the Foundation. It possesses several unique features that distinguish it from a typical human. SCP-3378 possesses an orange eyebrow eye coloration, and their head is adorned with pigtail hairstyles. Their forehead bears a two-color band marking, and they are often seen wearing a gold chain.

SCP-3378 manifests a prominent red lip facial feature. While appearing human, SCP-3378 exhibits an ability to plan and organize events effectively, but it also demonstrates a proclivity for impromptu adventures and spontaneous parties. SCP-3378's personality is unpredictable, and it has been known to play pranks and engage in lively, humorous situations with its friends.

Despite these peculiarities, SCP-3378 has not displayed any anomalous abilities or behaviors that would classify it as anything other than a human. However, as a necessary precaution, SCP-3378 has been contained for observation to ensure that no further anomalous behaviors manifest in the future.
