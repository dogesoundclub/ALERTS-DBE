Item #: SCP-8443

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8443 is to be monitored at all times during its deliveries. SCP-8443 is to be kept isolated from any human interaction when not in operation. Any attempt made by SCP-8443 to make any contact with other humans must be reported immediately to the site supervisor.

Description: SCP-8443 is a male human that works as a delivery driver for a private company. SCP-8443 possesses a unique appearance that is distinctive and easily recognizable. SCP-8443 has a mouth spot on the right side of his mouth, and a blue bandana on his head. He also sports a pair of red clown eyes and a goggle on his forehead. SCP-8443 has a jade earring on its left ear, and a silver chain around his neck. SCP-8443 wears an LED gas mask that obscures its face.

SCP-8443 is a very introverted individual and spends most of his time lost in thought. These thoughts tend to distract SCP-8443, which leads to a lack of awareness of its surroundings. SCP-8443 is prone to accidents, such as tripping on objects or walking into poles.

SCP-8443's gas mask contains an unknown substance that helps to regulate its emotions. This substance seems to calm SCP-8443 and reduces the likelihood of its self-harming behavior. However, the substance also causes SCP-8443 to suffer from memory loss and causes a significant cognitive handicap.

SCP-8443's connections to the company are unknown. It is suspected that SCP-8443 might have an anomalous effect on anything it delivers, but this has not been confirmed.

Addendum: Upon initial containment, SCP-8443 exhibited hostility towards personnel. After the gas mask was removed, SCP-8443 became compliant and cooperative. SCP-8443's amnesia and cognitive deficit made it difficult to determine if it had access to any anomalous capabilities. Further analysis is required.
