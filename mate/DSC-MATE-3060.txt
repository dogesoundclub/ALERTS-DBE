Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3060 is to be kept in a secure enclosure located within Site-██. In addition, any interactions with SCP-3060 must be closely monitored by at least one Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-3060 is a sentient, male Monkey of the Macaca fuscata species, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. The subject possesses a human-like language capacity and has demonstrated a level of intelligence comparable to that of a human with an IQ of 110.

SCP-3060 is notable for its fashion sense, often seen wearing a jade earring and a gold chain, which it acquired through unknown means. The subject is a trained firefighter and uses a whistle to alert others and communicate with team members in emergency situations.

Although typically cooperative, SCP-3060 has a deep curiosity about the world and often exhibits a desire to learn about niche topics. This can manifest in the form of the creature abruptly sharing random and obscure facts with others.

Caution is advised with SCP-3060, as it has demonstrated a level of cunning necessary for its survival in the wild. In one instance, SCP-3060 used tools to escape containment, requiring a significant effort by assigned staff members to recapture the creature.

Currently, no known anomalous properties have been observed in SCP-3060. Its existence, however, presents many questions and concerns regarding the intelligence and self-awareness of animals. Further research and containment is needed.

Addendum: During routine observation, SCP-3060 has demonstrated a fascination with the SCP Foundation database, seeking out information and asking numerous questions about other SCP objects. As such, any information given to the subject must be carefully selected and censored to prevent potential breaches of secrecy.
