Item #: SCP-7144

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7144 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, but must be provided with a stable supply of fresh carrots and candies at all times. Any requests made by SCP-7144 must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-7144 is a humanoid rabbit of approximately 75cm in height. It wears a purple cap and has green hair. Its eyes are obscured by thick nerd glasses, and it sports a scared mouth expression. SCP-7144 also has a gold earring and gold chain as accessories. It is observed to carry a candy stick at all times.

SCP-7144 is capable of speech and has been cooperative and compliant with Foundation guidelines. However, it is prone to anxious behavior, frequently worrying about minor details and obligations. SCP-7144 has a penchant for gift-giving, often spending excessive amounts of time and resources on finding the "perfect" gift for its acquaintances.

SCP-7144's anomalous abilities manifest in its gift-giving. Any gift given by SCP-7144 becomes an object of great sentimental and emotional value to the recipient, regardless of the gift's initial appearance or significance. This effect persists even after the item's usefulness or sentimental value has faded, leading some recipients to develop obsessive attachment to the object.

Addendum 7144-A: Testing of SCP-7144's gift-giving abilities have yielded both positive and negative results. Requests for SCP-7144 to gift dangerous or hazardous objects to Foundation personnel are strictly prohibited. Testing is ongoing to analyze SCP-7144's effects on items of varying complexity and value.
