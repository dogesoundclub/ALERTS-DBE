Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3456 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a minimum size of 10 by 10 meters. The chamber must include objects that provide stimulation to SCP-3456, such as books, music, or puzzles. SCP-3456 must have access to a daily psychiatrist session.

SCP-3456 may leave its cell only after obtaining permission from at least two Level 2 personnel, and under the supervision of at least one armed guard. SCP-3456 may not interact with any animal without permission from the Site Director.

SCP-3456's access to the internet is restricted to sites which have been approved by the Site Director.

Description:

SCP-3456 is a male tiger who has been transformed into a humanoid form. It stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 190 kilograms. SCP-3456 has VR Rainbow LED eyes and Jade Earrings. SCP-3456's head is characterized by a "Not Arranged Green" appearance, and it's often seen with a Red Scarf and a Candy Stick.

SCP-3456 exhibits a unique personality trait: deep empathy and understanding for others. When SCP-3456 witnesses another individual's pain or suffering, it is not uncommon for SCP-3456 to display emotional outbursts and shed tears. SCP-3456 also shows a fondness for animals and nature.

SCP-3456 was originally found by Foundation agents in ████████, Korea, after reports of sightings of an anthropomorphic tiger circulated among the local population. SCP-3456 was taken into custody after it attacked and injured five people in the village. Upon containment, SCP-3456 exhibited symptoms of extreme anxiety and PTSD.

SCP-3456 has cooperated with Foundation personnel and has proven to be a valuable asset in several investigations. SCP-3456's unique abilities have also shown promise in the development of new interrogation techniques.

Addendum:

Dr. ████ has requested an upgrade in SCP-3456's containment chamber, as SCP-3456 has shown signs of restlessness and depression. The request has been approved, and SCP-3456's chamber will now include a larger living space with a variety of vegetation and a small fountain. SCP-3456's daily psychiatry session has been increased from 1 hour to 2 hours per day.
