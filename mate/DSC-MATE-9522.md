Item #: 9522

Object Class: Villain

Species: Human

Gender: Female

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 9522 is to be contained in a maximum-security prison with all communication devices revoked. Any detainee or person attempting to come into contact with 9522 must establish perimeter security and wear an DSC-834 compliant headset to avoid hypnosis. 9522 should only be interacted with trained personnel, and its containment must be visually monitored at all times.

Description:

Subject 9522 is a human female with remarkable spots spread throughout her body. The head of 9522 is the most abnormal aspect, resembling that of a pink rabbit, including floppy bunny-like ears. 9522’s eyes are replaced with high-quality VR Rainbow LED strips that change in color according to emotions. It also has the innate ability to hypnotize people by looking directly into their eyes, causing them to enter a deep trance state, losing any control over their actions.

Personality:

Subject 9522 has a very peculiar, humorous personality, and by far, the most dangerously twisted of all DSC’s in the world. 9522 thrives on humor, making those around it laugh, often causing uncontrollable bursts of amusement. A natural-born jester, 9522 loves to tell funny stories, execute silly impersonations, and play pranks on both friend and foe alike. However, given the subject's hypnosis abilities, approaching 9522 unprepared can result in disastrous consequences.

Observations and Research:

DogeSoundClub personal report that subject 9522 is very unpredictable, violent, and incredibly challenging to contain. Its hypnosis capabilities have been noted as being the most potent the foundation has encountered, being capable of making an individual do anything it desires without any memory of previous events.

For these reasons, 9522 is considered an extreme risk to public safety and should be considered as the most significant threat to humanity in modern history. As with all DSCs, further study and analysis on 9522 are ongoing, and this file will be continuously updated with any new findings.
