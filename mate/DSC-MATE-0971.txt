Item #: SCP-971

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-971 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at all times, with access limited to authorized personnel only. As SCP-971 has demonstrated a tendency towards brainstorming and creativity, containment personnel are advised to keep the monkey engaged with puzzles and games to prevent potential mental deterioration.

Description: SCP-971 is a male monkey of unknown species, standing approximately 50 cm tall. The monkey is often seen wearing a Doge hat on its head, and a silver chain around its neck. It also has a distinctive 2-color band on its forehead and a jade earring in each ear. SCP-971 has an affinity for wearing glasses with its eyes, which appear normal.

SCP-971 exhibits a highly curious and energetic personality, displaying a strong tendency towards brainstorming and creativity. Its natural inclination towards generating new and unique ideas has led to some humorous situations, such as suggesting wild and outlandish solutions to problems simply to see the response of others. SCP-971 has shown no signs of aggression towards humans or other entities, but it is recommended that extreme caution be exercised when handling SCP-971 due to its unpredictable nature.

SCP-971 was first discovered working as a reporter for a local news station, where it had been able to maintain a level of anonymity despite its non-human appearance. Upon investigation by the Foundation, it was discovered that SCP-971 had been utilizing its unique abilities to uncover stories and generate headlines that rivalled even the best human reporters.

Addendum: Due to SCP-971's impressive intellect and creativity, it has been recommended that it be considered for relocation to Site-17, where it could potentially be of great benefit to Foundation research efforts. However, further testing and evaluation will be necessary before any reassignment is permitted.
