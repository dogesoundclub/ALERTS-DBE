SCP-9581's primary function is to respond to emergency calls and extinguish fires. Its body is equipped with various tools and gadgets, including a retractable hose, an air tank, and a thermal camera.

Addendum 9581-01: On ██/██/20██, SCP-9581 was sent on a mission to put out a raging fire at an abandoned warehouse in the outskirts of the city. Upon arrival, SCP-9581 discovered that the building was inhabited by a group of rogue individuals practicing illegal activities. SCP-9581 engaged in combat with the inhabitants and attempted to apprehend them. However, the group managed to disable SCP-9581's primary functions, resulting in the robot's shutdown. After recovery, SCP-9581 showed minor signs of deviancy, expressing self-doubt and anxiety. SCP-9581 was reprogrammed to avoid engaging in conflicts beyond its primary functions.
