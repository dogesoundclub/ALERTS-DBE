Item #: SCP-1787

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1787 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-47. Due to the nature of its abilities, SCP-1787 is to be monitored at all times by Level 2 personnel. Any attempted escape or use of its anomalous properties is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1787 is a male human of unknown age, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. It displays anomalous abilities related to organization and efficiency, making it a valuable asset to the Foundation.

SCP-1787's physical appearance is notable for the orange stripes on its face, and the gold earring it wears. It usually has green hair covered by a purple cap, and its eyes are always seen behind nerd glasses. SCP-1787 is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck.

The most concerning aspect of SCP-1787's abilities is its tendency to be controlling, particularly when it comes to group projects or events. This can sometimes result in humorous situations, but it can also lead to conflicts with other Foundation personnel. Care should be taken to avoid antagonizing SCP-1787, as it has shown a willingness to use its abilities to manipulate others.

Addendum: SCP-1787 was originally discovered working as a train driver in [REDACTED], where it would often re-arrange cargo in the most efficient manner possible, regardless of the intended destination. It was eventually apprehended by Foundation personnel and brought to Site-47 for containment and study. Further research is required to fully understand the extent of SCP-1787's anomalous properties.
