Item #: 5051 

Object Class: Humanoid 

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5051 is currently employed as a police officer and must maintain regular contact with human society. However, due to their peculiar fashion sense, they must avoid drawing attention to themselves.  Any interactions with the subject must be kept professional, as they have demonstrated a tendency to make sarcastic remarks where inappropriate. 

Description: Subject 5051 is a male humanoid, appearing to be roughly in their mid-thirties. They dress eccentrically, wearing a bucket hat and featuring a two-color band around their forehead. Additionally, they keep a goggle on their forehead at all times. The subject carries a portable gas mask with built-in LEDs that illuminate their face. 

Personality: The subject displays a distinct sense of sarcasm and wit, making them difficult to interact with as they often respond with unexpected deadpan jokes. They do not seek attention, but their humor and eccentric dress attract it nonetheless. Any attempts to suppress or intimidate the subject with authority have failed, as they maintain an unshaken will and sharp tongue in any situation. 

Due to their personality traits, it is advisable to approach the subject with caution and professionalism. Any attempts to engage in casual conversation are discouraged, as the subject may interpret it as a challenge and respond with their dry humor. While they are stable and pose no immediate danger, their anomalous behavior may cause a disruption in standard protocol, leading to unnecessary delays or errors if not handled carefully.
