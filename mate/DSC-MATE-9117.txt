Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9117 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a pressure-sensitive floor and a remotely-controlled airlock system. SCP-9117's LED gas mask is to remain secured to its head at all times, as removal may result in the release of an unknown gas. Access to SCP-9117 is to be granted only with the approval of at least two Level 2 personnel. All interactions with SCP-9117 are to be recorded for further study.

Description: SCP-9117 is a human male, approximately (INSERT HEIGHT), with distinctive orange stripes on his face. Its mouth is frozen in a state of perpetual fright, which leads to its nickname "The Frightened Veterinarian". SCP-9117 wears wired nerdy glasses over its almond-shaped eyes and a green cross earring adorns its left earlobe. It sports a gold chain around its neck and wears an LED gas mask that emits a dim amber light.

SCP-9117's personality is known to be impulsive and rash, often causing it to act before thinking things through. This recklessness results in SCP-9117 getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to impress others. However, SCP-9117's affable behavior and willingness to assist in any situation have made it a valuable addition to the Foundation.

Addendum 1: SCP-9117's medical expertise in veterinary science has proven to be invaluable in analyzing and treating anomalous creatures.

Addendum 2: Recent experiments have revealed the unknown gas emitted by SCP-9117's LED gas mask is a potent hallucinogen, affecting both humans and anomalous entities alike. Further investigation of this gas is ongoing.
