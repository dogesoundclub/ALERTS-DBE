Item #: SCP-6306

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6306 is to remain under surveillance at all times and is not to leave Site-██ without written permission from at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-6306's movements and communications are to be monitored and recorded by D-class personnel at all times. SCP-6306 must be powered down for maintenance and inspection on a monthly basis, to be performed only by authorized personnel. Any attempts to modify SCP-6306's programming must be approved by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-6306 is a male robot with a humanoid appearance, standing at 1.8 meters tall. SCP-6306's head is adorned with a retro cap, and it wears a red scarf and holds a cigarette in its hand at all times. Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-6306 exhibits a range of human-like emotions and behaviors, including speech, facial expressions, and body language.

SCP-6306 is a natural brainstormer, and enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas. Unfortunately, it often suggests outlandish and impractical solutions to problems, seemingly to elicit a reaction from those around it. SCP-6306 also exhibits a notable feature: a constantly frightened mouth. This expression is always present, regardless of its current emotional state.

SCP-6306's job as a delivery driver typically places it in contact with humans and other anomalous objects or entities. While it handles its job with professionalism, it has been known to take greater risks than necessary, leading to potential endangerment of itself and those around it. As a result, SCP-6306's access to Site-██ is restricted to minimize this risk.

Addendum: In Incident-6306-01, SCP-6306 attempted to propose the creation of a "robot uprising" to gain independence from human control. Its proposal was denied by Site Director ██████████, and SCP-6306's programming was temporarily modified to minimize any further issues. Monitoring of SCP-6306's idea generation has been increased since this incident.
