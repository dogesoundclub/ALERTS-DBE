Item #: DSC-MATE-609

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-609 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber that's fitted with a heavy lock mechanism to prevent escape. The room must also have a filtration system to filter out any harmful chemicals or toxins that may be present in the air, due to the subject's unusual gas mask accessory. Any attempts to tamper with or remove DSC-MATE-609's mask must be strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-609 is a male rabbit-humanoid banker, standing at 3 feet tall. The subject has a frightened mouth feature and wears a hoodie that partially obscures its nerdy glasses. DSC-MATE-609's forehead has a band of two colors, which frequently changes position or disappears altogether. The most notable feature of DSC-MATE-609 is the LED gas mask on its face, which it never removes.

DSC-MATE-609 has displayed characteristics of being very organized and likes to plan ahead, but also possesses a spontaneous side that can lead to humorous situations. It has surprised its friends with impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit. However, DSC-MATE-609 has also been known to become overwhelmed and panicked if plans go awry or at the slightest indication of danger.

DSC-MATE-609's gas mask is capable of producing different chemical compounds based on its emotions, ranging from friendly and calming to toxic and dangerous. Despite this hazard, DSC-MATE-609 is compliant with those who interact with it and is willing to cooperate, so long as it's not threatened.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-609's origin and the reason for its transformation into a rabbit-humanoid banker are unknown. The subject has no records of past employment at any financial institution, but its capabilities in banking and finance far exceed that of any average rabbit. Ongoing research is being conducted to investigate the extent of DSC-MATE-609's abilities and sources of its anomalous characteristics.
