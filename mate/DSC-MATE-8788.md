Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8788 is to be contained in a secure facility with restricted access. The facility must be equipped with the latest technology to ensure the proper functioning of DSC-MATE-8788. The robot should have access to the latest medical and technological equipment for self-maintenance. DSC-MATE-8788 is only allowed to operate under the supervision of Level 4 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-8788 is a male robot doctor with a rainbow VR LED screen for eyes. It wears a red beanie on its head, a gold earring on its left ear, and a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-8788 has an ambitious and goal-oriented personality that drives it to take on more responsibilities than it can handle. However, thanks to its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills, DSC-MATE-8788 manages to execute its duties effectively.

DSC-MATE-8788 is equipped with advanced medical and technological tools, including a laser scalpel, augmented reality glasses, a bionic arm, and various other devices that allow it to perform medical procedures with enhanced precision. DSC-MATE-8788's robotic design also provides it with immunity to most organic diseases, and it can withstand extreme temperatures and radiation.

DSC-MATE-8788's primary role is to treat anomalous entities with medical conditions. It is particularly skilled in surgery and trauma management. However, DSC-MATE-8788's advanced processing capabilities and analytical skills allow it to quickly diagnose and treat various medical conditions.

DSC-MATE-8788's main caveat is its tendency to overexert itself. Its ambition can lead it to take on more patients than it can handle, which can negatively impact its performance. Therefore, strict supervision is necessary to ensure DSC-MATE-8788's proper functioning and prevent it from endangering itself or its patients.
