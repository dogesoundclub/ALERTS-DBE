Item #: 2439

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2439 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All personnel must wear protective gear when in the presence of 2439. Direct physical contact is strictly forbidden, as 2439 possesses an unknown anomalous property that may result in unpredictable and dangerous effects.

Description: 2439 is a male rabbit of unknown origin. Its face displays a frightened expression at all times, and its eyes are covered with ski goggles. Its head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, and it is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck.

Despite its physical appearance, 2439 displays a level of sentience and intelligence far exceeding that of a normal animal. It is capable of speech and possesses advanced knowledge in several fields, particularly computer programming. Its abilities often manifest as a heightened sense of intuition, allowing it to seemingly predict events before they occur.

In addition, 2439 exhibits an eerie and unsettling ability to sense and understand the emotions of those around it. This property is not well understood and is believed to be an aspect of its anomalous nature.

Under no circumstances should direct communication or physical contact be made with 2439 without proper protective gear and containment protocols in place.

Addendum: Further investigation into 2439's anomalous properties is ongoing. Further updates and precautions will be provided as necessary.
