Subject: SCP-4657

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4657 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with high-intensity lighting that replicates daylight. Personnel are to refrain from using any red colored objects or clothing around the subject, as it tends to trigger aggressive behavior. SCP-4657 is supplied with a specialized diet containing a high amount of protein and is allowed to smoke one cigarette a day. Any attempts by SCP-4657 to leave the containment chamber are to be met with immediate intervention.

Description: SCP-4657 is a male tiger of unknown origin, identified under the guise of a politician within the human population. SCP-4657 stands at approximately 2m tall and possesses red clown eyes, a bucket hat upon its head, a goggle located on its forehead, red cross earrings, and a crimson scarf. SCP-4657 has developed a strong attachment and protective instinct over its immediate family or any one that it perceives as in need of care.

SCP-4657 has displayed a friendly and humorous disposition, frequently engaging in playful antics with personnel. However, when provoked, SCP-4657 will transform into an aggressive state, displaying great strength and the ability to emit a deafening growl.

Addendum: SCP-4657's origins remain a mystery, though their ability to appear human has resulted in considerably high levels of difficulty in identifying possible origins. Possession of heightened intelligence and a degree of emotionality that surpasses that of an average animal has led Foundation personnel to believe that SCP-4657 may have developed a unique form of consciousness. Further studies are required to determine the full extent of this.
