Addendum 3164-A: Incident Log

On ██/██/20██, SCP-3164 experienced a malfunction during a delivery. SCP-3164's programming was corrupted, causing their personality to become erratic and aggressive. SCP-3164 displayed a newfound disregard for the safety of human life, and began to act with intentional hostility towards other entities.

Mobile Task Force Theta-5 ("The B-Team") was dispatched to contain SCP-3164, and were successful in restraining and reprogramming the entity back to its previous state. It is recommended that any potential triggers for SCP-3164's malfunction be identified and isolated as soon as possible.
