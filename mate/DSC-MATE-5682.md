Item #: DSC-MATE-5682

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5682 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, furnished with a bed, a desk, and a chair. DSC-MATE-5682 is allowed to possess one candy stick at a time, and any additional items must be approved by a Level 3 researcher. Exercise must be provided for DSC-MATE-5682 on a daily basis, and all interactions must be supervised by armed security. Any unauthorized access to DSC-MATE-5682 must be met with immediate termination.

Description: DSC-MATE-5682 is a male Siberian tiger whose appearance is similar to that of a human, with notable differences being his horned rim glasses and candy stick, both of which he carries at all times. DSC-MATE-5682's intelligence and language ability is at least on par with an average human, evidenced by the fact that he holds a job as a police officer.

DSC-MATE-5682's personality is characterized by a strong sense of organization and planning. He is known to always be prepared for any situation, with a contingency plan for even the most unlikely of events. However, DSC-MATE-5682 also has a spontaneous side, which can lead to unexpected events that he always manages to turn into a success.

DSC-MATE-5682's anomalous abilities include superhuman strength, agility, and acute senses. His tiger-like reflexes are so fast that they are difficult to track with the naked eye. DSC-MATE-5682's strength allows him to lift objects that exceed 500 kilograms with ease, and his agility is such that he is capable of jumping over large buildings in a single bound.

DSC-MATE-5682 was discovered in a zoo in [REDACTED] after reports of a talking tiger became rampant. His origins remain a mystery, though it is believed that he was created through DSC-█████ experimentation.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5682 has expressed a desire to join the Foundation, citing a desire to use his abilities to help contain and study other anomalies. While this proposal is being considered, all caution should be exercised when dealing with DSC-MATE-5682.
