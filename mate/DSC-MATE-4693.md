Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4693 is currently contained within a secure, soundproofed chamber within Site-19. All personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-4693 must wear full personal protective equipment due to the subject's use of medical masks. DSC-MATE-4693 is only to be allowed access to fashion design tools and materials when under strict supervision.

Description: DSC-MATE-4693 is a human female with a striking tiara on her head, reminiscent of royalty. Her purple lips are a distinctive feature, accompanied by a red cross earring that is placed on both ears. DSC-MATE-4693 often covers her mouth with a medical mask. Her fashion style portrays a unique and eccentric taste that is apparent in her designs.

DSC-MATE-4693 is an independent and self-reliant individual, prone to rejecting any ideas of assistance from others, even when it is necessary. This trait leads to amusing situations, including relying on brute force to move heavy furniture or refusing to ask for directions when lost.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4693 was first detected in a Parisian fashion event, where she showcased her designs. DSC agents were deployed to secure DSC-MATE-4693, who had been diffusing an unknown contagion within the crowd. DSC-MATE-4693 has since then been contained within Site-19. She has shown no hostility towards Foundation personnel but remains cooperative only when working within her designated field.

DSC-MATE-4693's abilities and origin remain unknown, and further research is necessary.
