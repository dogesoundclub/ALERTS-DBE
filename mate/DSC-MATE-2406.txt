Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2406 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-2406 is restricted to Level-2 personnel and above for observation purposes. Under no circumstances are staff members to engage in any physical contact with SCP-2406 unless authorized by on-site security personnel.

Description: SCP-2406 is a male simian genetically resembling a type of monkey (Papio hamadryas). The subject is observed wearing a "Doge" hat and shaded glasses. SCP-2406's atypical appearance is further accentuated with the addition of a cigarette, which it appears to smoke consistently.

The most notable attribute of SCP-2406 is its strong sense of duty and responsibility as a theater manager. Despite its playful nature, SCP-2406 always prioritizes its duties and responsibilities to the theater's patrons and employees. It appears that SCP-2406 has an innate understanding of their needs and is quick to ensure the theater is running smoothly. 

SCP-2406 is an excellent host and can engage with any audience, contributing to a fantastic, enjoyable experience for all individuals in attendance. Its charisma often leads to dancing, singing, and other upbeat, party-oriented events enjoyed by staff members and clientele alike. SCP-2406's unique personality highlights its dual nature of knowing how to have fun while maintaining its sense of responsibility.

Addendum:

SCP-2406's anomalous attributes are still under investigation. Preliminary tests suggest that SCP-2406's high intelligence, charisma, and sense of responsibility are likely a result of a combination of genetic manipulation and temporal anomalies. Further research is necessary to determine the extent to which these attributes can augment its performance in various scenarios.
