Item #: SCP-3267

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3267 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access is to be granted only to Level 2 personnel with authorization by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-3267's diet consists mostly of vegetables and fruits, and occasionally, candy. No animal flesh is to be provided under any circumstances, as it leads to aggressive behavior. Any personnel in contact with SCP-3267 are to be reminded not to use any threatening or violent language due to its easily frightened nature.

Description: SCP-3267 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 1 meter in height. Its face exhibits a permanently frightened expression, with a wide open mouth. Its eyes are bright red and appear circular, much like clown or anime eyes, which provides it with excellent vision in low-light conditions. SCP-3267 wears a Doge hat on its head and a single jade earring in its right ear. It also wears a gold chain around its neck and carries a candy stick at all times.

SCP-3267's behavior towards humans is generally docile and submissive. However, it has been observed to become aggressive when presented with animal flesh or upon hearing violent or aggressive language. SCP-3267 appears to be a very caring and nurturing individual, often treating its friends and family as though they were its own children. This behavior has led to some humorous situations during containment.

SCP-3267 was discovered working at a fast-food restaurant in [REDACTED], where it served customers happily until an incident in which it viciously attacked a customer who threatened it with a knife. Foundation agents were called in to contain SCP-3267 and transported it to Site-██ for further study.

Addendum: SCP-3267 has demonstrated the ability to speak, albeit in a high-pitched, falsetto voice. It has expressed an interest in writing poetry and has been allowed to do so under supervision for research purposes. SCP-3267's poetry is often whimsical and child-like in nature, with themes of love, friendship, and nature.
