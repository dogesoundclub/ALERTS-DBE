Item #: SCP-2480

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2480 is to be housed within a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with a specially designed ventilation system capable of accommodating its cigarette usage. SCP-2480 is allowed to maintain its profession as a fashion designer provided that its products do not contain anomalous properties or pose a threat to the public.

Description: SCP-2480 is a humanoid entity of the species Panthera tigris, standing at 1.93 meters tall and weighing approximately 115 kilograms. It appears to be a male entity with green hair styled in a purple cap, wearing normal glasses over its yellow eyes. A gold earring is present on each of its ears, with a goggle often seen resting on its forehead.

SCP-2480 is capable of communicating fluently in Human English, displaying a great sense of humor and a love for making others laugh. It is often seen telling funny stories and performing silly impersonations, sometimes to the point of interfering with its daily routine. SCP-2480 is often seen smoking a cigarette, and displays a degree of irritation when asked to extinguish it.

Addendum: It has been noted that SCP-2480's fashion designs are considered highly fashionable and favored by many in the fashion industry. Several Foundation personnel have expressed an interest in obtaining SCP-2480's designs for personal use. However, this request was denied as it violates the Foundation's mission to contain and study anomalous entities.
