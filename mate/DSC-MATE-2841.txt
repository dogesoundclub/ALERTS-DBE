Item #: 2841

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2841 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-2841 is allowed to retain its employment as a banker, provided it is monitored during all business hours and all interactions with non-foundation personnel are recorded.

SCP-2841 is required to wear its LED gas mask at all times while outside of its containment chamber to prevent possible anomalous effects.

Researchers are permitted to interact with SCP-2841 for the purpose of conducting interviews or study, with approval from at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2841 is a female human with distinct orange stripes on its face and pig-tails on its head. Its eyes are a bright orange and it is commonly seen wearing a gold earring and silver chain.

Of note, SCP-2841's most unusual feature is its ability to connect with individuals on a very deep level. It possesses an alluring charisma that often leads to it being able to extract information from individuals with ease. To date, no anomalous psychic abilities have been observed or measured, and it is currently unknown what allows SCP-2841 to make such deep connections with others.

SCP-2841's smile is disconcerting to some but is believed to be a natural facial expression as opposed to an anomalous effect. Despite its friendly disposition, SCP-2841 is to be considered dangerous and unpredictable, and all interactions should be conducted with caution.

Addendum: SCP-2841 has expressed a desire to use its anomalous ability to help the Foundation in its goals. As such, permission has been granted to allow SCP-2841 to serve as a liaison with certain external groups or individuals which are deemed low risk. Any such interactions will be monitored and recorded for review.
