Item #: SCP-7530

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7530 is to be contained in a standard rabbit hutch within a secure containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-7530 is strictly limited to Class D personnel and above, who must wear protective gear when interacting with the subject. Any instances of SCP-7530-1 (see Addendum 7530-1) that appear within a five meter radius of SCP-7530 must be terminated immediately.

Description: SCP-7530 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, standing at approximately 30 cm tall and weighing 1.5 kg. SCP-7530 is distinguishable from non-anomalous rabbits by its unusual fashion accessories, which include a Doge hat, a pair of jade earrings, a red scarf, and a candy stick.

SCP-7530 displays a consistently frightened expression, with its mouth open and eyes widened. When approached by unfamiliar humans, SCP-7530 will attempt to flee or hide, although it does not display any signs of increased stress beyond those typically seen in rabbits.

SCP-7530 exhibits a scatterbrained personality, with a tendency to forget tasks or become easily distracted. This has the potential to lead to dangerous situations, as SCP-7530 has been observed to wander out of containment in pursuit of shiny objects or tasty treats. As such, SCP-7530's containment chamber is to be checked hourly for any signs of breach.

Addendum 7530-1: SCP-7530 has been observed to emit a high-pitched squeal when in close proximity to certain individuals, designated SCP-7530-1. SCP-7530-1 instances have not been found to exhibit any anomalous properties themselves, although their presence appears to elevate SCP-7530's stress levels and increase its desire to escape containment. It is recommended that all individuals who do not require direct interaction with SCP-7530 maintain a distance of at least five meters.
