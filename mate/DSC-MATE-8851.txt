SCP Foundation report on subject 8851:

Subject 8851 is identified as a male Tiger with a profession as a Doctor. He exhibits a strong sense of independence and has been known to resist authority or rules which he perceives as unnecessary. Rumours suggest he sneaks out of the office early or takes a day off without permission.

Subject 8851 is often seen wearing nerd glasses on his piercing eyes, a red beanie on his head, with a goggle resting on his forehead. He sports a single Jade earring on one of his ears and wears a medical mask to conceal his identity.

SCP Foundation agents have noted that the subject has some strange abilities, as he can heal his own wounds at an incredible pace. It was also reported that subject 8851 had once healed the wounds of a patient who just got into a bloody car accident, without even touching the patient. This observation raises serious concerns about the origin of the subject's abilities, and a thorough examination of his DNA is highly recommended.

In conclusion, subject 8851 is unique in his appearance and abilities. It is recommended that caution is taken when engaging with him, as his rebellious behaviour puts him at a higher risk of breaking containment. Any unusual behaviour or activity should be reported immediately to the SCP Foundation.
