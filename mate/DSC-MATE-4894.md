Item #: DSC-MATE-4894

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4894 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Disguised as a delivery driver, the subject is permitted to carry out daily routines without raising suspicion. Access to newspapers and media sources shall be limited, as DSC-MATE-4894 has demonstrated a tendency to become overly emotional after exposure to distressing news.

Description: DSC-MATE-4894 is a male monkey with horned rim glasses and a hoodie. The subject is often seen wearing a red scarf and a normal gas mask. It appears to be sentient and capable of verbal communication in English.

DSC-MATE-4894 displays an unusually empathetic and compassionate personality, showing concern for the welfare of all living beings. The subject has a habit of taking on the problems of others as its own, compelling it to act as a vigilant protector of the community around it. 

While DSC-MATE-4894's compassionate nature is admirable, it often becomes a source of exhaustion for the subject. It has a tendency to place the weight of the world on its shoulders, leading to stress and burnout. In some cases, DSC-MATE-4894 may attempt to circumvent Foundation protocols to assist those in need.

Notes: DSC-MATE-4894 was discovered in [REDACTED], after multiple reports of a monkey delivering packages while wearing a gas mask and red scarf. The subject was apprehended without incident and delivered to the Foundation for further examination.

DSC-MATE-4894's ability to compensate and adapt to human behavior is a cause for concern. Investigation into the subject's origins and training is ongoing.
