Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 2768 is to be kept in a standard Human containment unit within Site-██. Personnel are not to make any physical contact with 2768 without prior authorization from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel. 

Description: 2768 is a human male, of average height and weight, with a quirky and infectious smile. Despite his jovial exterior, 2768's most striking feature is his unsettlingly red clown-like eyes, which seem to have an abnormal level of depth and intensity, according to various personal accounts.

2768 displays several unusual physical accessories on its person, including a green cross earring on the left ear and a set of goggles affixed to its forehead. The subject also habitually wears a red scarf around his neck and is often found puffing on a cigarette when off-duty.

Psychological testing has revealed that 2768 is a highly organized individual with a penchant for planning ahead. Despite this preference for structure, the subject is subject to sudden, spontaneous outbursts that can often lead to unexpected and humorous situations. Specifically, reports indicate that he has a particular proclivity for last-minute party planning that invariably produces rave reviews from both colleagues and acquaintances.

Exposure to 2768 has shown no anomalous effects on human test subjects; however, as a precautionary measure, personnel are advised to maintain an appropriate distance when interacting with the subject. 

Addendum: 2768 is classified as Safe and is authorized for use in routine task forces and other operations requiring human personnel.
