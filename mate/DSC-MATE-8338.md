Description: Officer 8338 is an adult male monkey that stands at approximately 3 feet tall. 8338 bears the mark of frightened-mouth, the curved stretch of the lips peered through by an unerring stare, a mixture of fear and intense curiosity. He wears a retro cap that covers his hairy, brown head with a pair of goggles strapped around his forehead, which he refuses to wear. He also wears a police uniform and carries a whistle around his neck.

Personality: Officer 8338 has a strong sense of independence that extends to resisting any rules or authority that he deems unnecessary or arbitrary. Despite this, Agent 8338 takes his job as an officer in urban fantasy seriously and is dedicated to keeping the public safe from supernatural entities. However, 8338's actions can sometimes lead to some rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission. His impulsiveness and independent nature can sometimes make him difficult to manage, but his determination and courage in the face of danger make him a valuable asset to the Foundation.

Note: Any personnel found giving Officer 8338 any alcoholic or caffeinated beverages as well as not adhering to the feeding schedule will be dealt with severely.
