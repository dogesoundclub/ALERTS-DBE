Item #: SCP-6374

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6374 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with additional safety measures to ensure the safety of personnel in case of escape or containment breach. Under no circumstances is SCP-6374 to be allowed behind the controls of any train or locomotive. All maintenance tasks relating to trains and tracks must be carried out by Foundation personnel with SCP-6374 observing from a safe distance.

Description: SCP-6374 appears to be a male monkey of an unknown species with red clown eyes. Its head is adorned with a purple cap featuring a headset, and its ears have a gold earring. SCP-6374 is particularly attached to its red scarf and whistle, which it keeps on its person at all times.

SCP-6374 is a practical and hands-on individual, often fixing things in unconventional ways. It is not above using duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects or rigging up makeshift solutions to solve problems others may find too complicated. Despite its talent for improvisation, SCP-6374 is prone to reckless behavior and prefers to act on a whim rather than carefully consider consequences. This has led to several incidents and containment breaches in the past.

SCP-6374's anomalous properties manifest when it is in control of a locomotive or train. While operating any form of transportation, SCP-6374's behavior becomes erratic, and it begins to exhibit increased strength and agility, able to negotiate obstacles and navigate tracks with impossible speed and accuracy. Passengers and crew on the locomotive have reported feeling a sense of unease and dread in its presence.

Addendum: SCP-6374 was discovered when reports of a runaway train being operated by a monkey surfaced in the media. Foundation agents were able to track down SCP-6374 and take it into custody before it could cause any severe damage. SCP-6374's intelligence and abilities make it a significant potential asset if properly trained and controlled. However, its unpredictable nature and lack of cooperation make it challenging to work with. Research into its abilities and physiology is ongoing.
