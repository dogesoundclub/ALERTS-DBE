Item #: SCP-9053

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9053 is to be contained within a reinforced, soundproof room to prevent disturbing nearby personnel. Access to SCP-9053 is only allowed with the permission of Level 4 personnel and a full security escort. SCP-9053 is to be kept well-fed and given nicotine gum as a substitute for cigarettes.

Description: SCP-9053 appears externally as a tiger with a frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes. The tiger has an earring with the Red Cross symbol on one ear, and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-9053 also wears a goggle on its forehead.

SCP-9053 identifies as a politician and has a personality trait that leaves it introspective, often daydreaming for long durations. This personality sometimes leads to several comical situations, the most common being SCP-9053 accidentally walking into poles or tripping while lost in thought. 

Further observations of SCP-9053's politicking have indicated that it has a high degree of charisma and empathy toward its constituents. Additionally, it is exceptionally skilled at navigating the political landscape in its favor - making successful elections and further spreading its influence within urban environments.

SCP-9053 is capable of limited telepathy and mind control, with immediate powers towards humans who are already believed to share their political views. 

Addendum: SCP-9053 is to be monitored regularly due to its nature as a master manipulator of public opinion. Administration of amnestics is authorized to maintain secrecy and prevent uncontrolled mindset alteration.
