Subject 3703 is a high-ranking politician with a peculiar appearance which makes him stand out in any crowd. His mouth is marked with a strange spot, and his eyes are encased behind ski goggles, which seem to serve no purpose other than to add to his eccentricity. His head is not arranged in any particular fashion and is often styled in a messy and disheveled manner, giving him an air of nonchalance.

Upon closer inspection, one can notice a goggle adorning his forehead, seemingly out of place, but the subject seems to pay it no mind. His ears are pierced with a striking green cross earring, adding to his already unusual appearance. He is often seen sporting a silver chain around his neck, and he always has a candy stick sticking out of his pocket - his preferred snacking choice.

Despite his unusual appearance, Subject 3703 possesses an impressive work ethic and a flair for leadership. He has a strong sense of organization and plans everything down to the minutest detail. However, he also has a spontaneous side to him, leading to instances of last-minute party planning and impromptu adventures with his friends. These instances often result in humor and mirth, as he manages to pull it off successfully.

One must be careful around Subject 3703, for although he seems jovial and jocular, he is also an astute politician. He has a sharp mind, and his wits are as honed as his appearance. His strategic planning and spontaneous nature make him a force to be reckoned with, with the potential of leading his nation to greater heights.
