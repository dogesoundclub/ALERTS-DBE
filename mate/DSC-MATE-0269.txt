Job: Subject 269's work entails delivering news to the populace. As a news anchor, he is required to report on current events, often with accuracy and restraint.

Containment: Subject 269 is to be contained within a secure enclosure, consisting of a specified living area, food and water stations, climate control, and daily interaction with assigned staff members designated to monitor their behavior for possible signs of obsession or distress.

Note: Despite their tendency towards monomania, Subject 269 has thus far demonstrated no potential for harmful behavior towards either themselves or others. However, caution is recommended when dealing with this subject, particularly if their obsessive behavior intensifies.
