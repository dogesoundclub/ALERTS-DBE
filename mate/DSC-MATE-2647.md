Item #2647, designated as "The Artistic Banker," is a human female with unique physical characteristics. Her facial features display various spots juxtaposed with red lipstick, with her eyes sporting an unnaturally bright shade of orange; further distinctive characteristics that make her stand out in a crowd include pigtail-esque hair and exaggerated cross-shaped earrings that seem to be glowing with an unknown force.

As a talented banker, she has a remarkable and highly analytical mind that enables her to excel in her duties at her workplace. However, what makes Item #2647 unique is her personal creative side that she often expresses through various artistic forms, such as painting, drawing, writing, or any other craft that evokes her imaginative demons.

Having undergone considerable training and an extensive screening process, Item #2647 remains highly cooperative and compliant with the Foundation, and she has demonstrated a deep understanding of her corporate and social responsibilities. She shows no apparent adverse effects on human minds or biological systems, making her an invaluable asset to the Foundation's data analysis team.

As with all DSCs, Item #2647 is under constant monitoring and is kept in a highly-secured area, but we are confident that we can harness her unique abilities and innovative thinking into an asset in the fight against anomalous entities. The Foundation is fortunate to have such talent on our side.
