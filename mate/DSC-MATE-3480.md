Item #: 3480

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3480 is to be monitored under normal conditions at all times. They are allowed to work as a veterinarian as long as their daily activites do not raise any suspicion. Their living quarters must be inspected bi-weekly, without Subject 3480 being present in the premises.

Description: Subject 3480 is a humanoid entity of the female sex covered in orange stripes, donning a bucket hat on the head, gold earrings on the ears, a silver chain around the neck, and sporting a captivating smile. Of note, the eyes seem to be cybernetic in nature, featuring VR Rainbow LED lights. The subject is often seen smoking a cigarette.

Beyond its distinctive appearance, Subject 3480 presents unusual mannerisms, including an unusual attention to detail that often manifests as obsessive behavior. They can spend hours alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet, and any mess or disorder in their surroundings can lead to bouts of anxiety and distress.

The subject is capable of functioning as a vet, although their colleagues have reported that Subject 3480 displays an unusual level of empathy towards even the most aggressive animals, leading to a near-constant state of exhaustion. It is unknown if the subject's hyper-detailed personality is related to their professional skills and if there are any further anomalous effects. Further research is necessary.

Addendum: Further interviews with Subject 3480 suggest that they are aware of their abnormal behavior but refuse to get help, claiming that the world needs more order and that it would be an insult to their intelligence to seek assistance. It is unclear if this particular aspect of their personality has any effect on their anomalous qualities. End log.
