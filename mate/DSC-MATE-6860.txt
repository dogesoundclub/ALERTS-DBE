SCP-6860 is a female human of average height and build, with distinct orange stripes across her face and striking purple lips. Her glasses, while standard in appearance, seem to enhance her vision and give her an almost predatory gaze. She is often seen wearing a gold tiara with a two-color band across her forehead and a single gold earring in her left ear.

SCP-6860 is a skilled mechanic and is often found covered in grease and oil while working on various machines and vehicles. She has a fondness for tinkering and can make even the most complicated device work without fail. However, it is unknown how she obtained her mechanical skills, and further investigation is needed.

While SCP-6860 may seem tough on the outside, she is a very emotional being and can be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or television shows. She has a deep appreciation for music and art that evokes strong feelings, often using them as a way to process her emotions. It is suggested that personnel handling this SCP use caution when discussing sensitive subjects, as she may become overwhelmed.

SCP-6860 wears a gold chain around her neck and is often seen wearing a standard gas mask, though it is unknown why she does so. It is suggested that standard precautions be taken when interacting with this SCP, as further study is needed.
