Item #: 2180

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2180 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. All visiting personnel must wear a Class A hazmat suit before entering 2180's cell due to the risk of contamination.

Description: Subject 2180 is a human female beautician with a noticeable purple lip and blue clown eyes. Their head portrays a rainbow festival appearance, but attention should be given to the goggles on their forehead, resembling those of a mad scientist. 2180 also wears a red cross earring, a choker, and a normal gas mask as accessories.

2180 has been noted to communicate with a dry sense of humor, which can surprise those who are not familiar with their personality. Despite not being the life of the party, 2180's deadpan jokes are often surprisingly entertaining.

Subjects who have come into contact with 2180 report experiencing unusual effects, including changes in skin and hair color, the appearance of unusual tattoos, and temporary, highly localized blindness.

Research into 2180's powers and their source is ongoing, with a particular focus on preventing any accidental and potentially harmful effects.
