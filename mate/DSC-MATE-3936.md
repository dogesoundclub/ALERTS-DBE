Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3936 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell reinforced with reinforced steel bars to prevent escape.

Any attempt at escape should be met with lethal force.

Description: Subject 3936, also known as the "Traffic Tiger," is a male tiger with purple fur and a distinctive cap with a headset. His forehead features two color bands, with a red cross earring on each ear, and he is always seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle.

3936's abilities include enhanced hearing, agility, and strength, making him a formidable opponent in close combat. However, his introverted and introspective personality often leads him to daydream or become lost in thought, resulting in comic mishaps such as walking into poles or tripping over objects.

3936 is employed as a traffic officer by local law enforcement agencies, using his heightened senses to help control traffic and prevent accidents. Despite his seemingly benign job, 3936 has been implicated in several instances of vigilante justice, using his formidable physical abilities to take on and defeat criminal elements.

It is currently unknown how 3936 gained his abilities or how he is able to communicate in human language. Further study of this anomalous subject is recommended.
