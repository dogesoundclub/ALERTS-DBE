Item #: 5508

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5508 is to be kept under constant surveillance while on the premises of the car dealership they work at. They are not to be allowed access to any electronic devices not approved by the Foundation. Any attempts at unauthorized use of DSC-MATE-5508's LED technology must be met with immediate disciplinary action. In addition, under no circumstances should any member of the public be allowed to glimpse the jade LED eyes of DSC-MATE-5508, as this may trigger a memetic effect.

Description: DSC-MATE-5508 is a female human with green hair in a purple cap, jade earring, and an LED gas mask. Their eyes have been replaced with jade-colored LED screens, which appear to be either an advanced prosthetic or some form of cybernetic enhancement. The subject speaks in a soft, almost whispering voice and is known to be highly persuasive.

Personality: DSC-MATE-5508's highly creative and artistic personality may appear to be at odds with their occupation as a car salesman. However, upon further investigation, it is clear that they use their artistic flair to help sell cars. They frequently post artistic photographs of the cars they sell on social media, as well as other creative ads. Their cybernetic enhancements allow them to alter the appearance of the cars they sell in real-time, which has resulted in an unprecedented success rate in their sales.

Addendum: Incident 5508-01

On ██/██/20██, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-5508 had been using their LED technology to create visual illusions on potential car buyers. This led to a significant increase in car sales, but also resulted in complaints from customers who felt they had been tricked. DSC-MATE-5508 was reprimanded and reminded of the importance of ethical behavior in their line of work. Additional measures were implemented to avoid such an incident occurring again.
