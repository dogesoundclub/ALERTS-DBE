SCP-3094 is a fascinating specimen of the human species, distinguished by her striking physical appearance and eccentric fashion accessories. Subject is easily identifiable by her signature red lip and shiny gold earring, which contrast sharply with her retro cap and LED gas mask. Most notably, however, are her eyes, which are fitted with high-tech VR rainbow LED lenses that give off a colorful and surreal glow, almost as if she were an otherworldly creature.

Despite her unusual appearance, SCP-3094 is a highly skilled reporter, and her nurturing and caring personality makes her an asset in any journalistic investigation. This personality trait has, however, led to some humorous situations, as SCP-3094 sometimes tends to take care of her colleagues and sources in a maternal manner, fussing over them and making sure they have everything they need. She is also known to treat her family members and close friends as if they were her own children, which has led to some amusing situations where she scolds them for not wearing enough layers or leaving the house without an umbrella.

Overall, SCP-3094 is a unique and valuable asset to the Foundation, both for her journalistic skills and her endearing personality. However, due to her highly noticeable appearance, she should be carefully monitored during all field operations to avoid attracting unwanted attention.
