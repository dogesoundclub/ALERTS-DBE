Item #: 5965

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5965 is to be monitored closely and any unusual behavior is to be reported immediately. Due to their profession, access to high-end fashion materials and tools should be limited to avoid potential anomalous properties. A daily limit of tasks and responsibilities should be set to prevent subject from taking on more than they can handle.

Description: Subject 5965 is a humanoid male with orange stripes on their face, a blue bandana on their head, and jade LED eyes. They wear a green cross earring and a gold chain as an accessory. Despite their normal appearance, subject 5965 has shown to have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can lead to them taking on more tasks than they can handle.

Subject 5965 has been identified as a fashion designer and has shown an unusual talent for creating garments with anomalous properties. It is believed that their eyes and earring may have been modified with anomalous properties. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Personality-wise, subject 5965 is surprisingly upbeat and can often be seen juggling multiple tasks at any given moment, much to the amusement of others. However, containment personnel are advised to be cautious as this behavior can lead to them becoming overburdened and potentially causing harm to themselves and others.

Due to their unique talents, subject 5965 may be a valuable asset to the foundation if properly contained and controlled. SCP-5965 research and collaboration is currently underway.
