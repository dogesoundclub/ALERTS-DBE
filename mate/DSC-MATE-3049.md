Item #: 3049

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the unpredictable behavior of 3049, he is to be kept under constant surveillance at all times. He is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and is to be provided with basic amenities. Access to 3049 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher with written permission from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: 3049 is a human male with distinct features that set him apart from other humans. He has spots scattered across his face, making his appearance similar to that of a leopard. He has red clown eyes that appear to be permanently dilated, and his head is made of a metal purple material, which has unknown origins.

On his forehead, he wears a pair of goggles that seem to have no practical use. His ears are pierced with a jade earring, and he wears a silver chain around his neck. He wears a medical mask over his mouth at all times, and it is unknown whether this is for his protection or that of others.

3049 is a natural leader and possesses an innate talent for taking charge of any situation he finds himself in. He has a commanding presence and often finds himself in leadership roles both in his professional and personal life. His personality is enigmatic, and he tends to keep to himself, making it difficult to decipher his motives or intentions.

Addendum: 3049 was discovered when reports started coming in about a lawyer that was able to plea bargain impossible cases without any formal training. Investigations led to the discovery of 3049, who was operating under an assumed name. After a short struggle, he was brought into custody and has been contained ever since. It is still unknown how he is able to do what he does, and research is ongoing.
