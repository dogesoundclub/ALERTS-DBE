Description: DSC-MATE-7986 is a human female of unknown age and origin. She stands at 5'8" and has a distinct appearance, with an orange side hairstyle and red clown eyes. Her lips are purple, and she has a unique two-color band on her forehead. She also wears a green cross earring and a gold chain as accessories.

DSC-MATE-7986 possesses excellent observational skills and attention to detail, making them a valuable asset in gift-giving situations. However, these traits can also lead to excessive concern over finding the perfect gift, causing DSC-MATE-7986 to spend an excessive amount of time and resources in the pursuit of the ideal present.

DSC-MATE-7986 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and has been permitted to continue her work as a firefighter. However, her anomalous appearance makes it necessary to limit her interaction with the general public.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7986 has expressed interest in further testing to determine the extent of her anomalous abilities. Further study is currently under consideration.
