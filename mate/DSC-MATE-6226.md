Item #: 6226

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its humanoid nature, Item #6226 must be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-19. Any requests made by Item #6226 must be screened by at least two Level 3 personnel. The walls of its chamber must be plated with reinforced steel to prevent escape attempts. Item #6226's requests for writing utensils, paper, and any office equipment as agreed in the Foundation's contract must be compliant with standard human use. 

Description: Item #6226 is a humanoid entity of simian origin, identified as a Capuchin Monkey. Item #6226 is a male subject with a retro cap on its head, two-colored band on its forehead, shade glasses, and a set of goggles resting on its forehead. Item #6226 is often seen wearing a gold earring with a gas mask, while smoking cigars in its recess time in its chamber.

Personality: Item #6226 possesses a dry sense of humor that often catches the Foundation personnel off guard. Though not particularly fond of socializing, Item #6226 is capable of delivering deadpan jokes that prove humorous to those it confides in. Nevertheless, its ability to manipulate its surroundings is a threat to the Foundation's clandestine efforts. Item #6226 often requests Foundation resources, which it uses to gain access to privileged information that it then publishes in local newspapers with its employer, The Global Times. The Foundation is concerned that its personality makes it a potential security risk.

Addendum: Level 3 access control ensures Item #6226 is unable to access Foundation databases without orders from high-ranking officials. Item #6226's contract contains a non-disclosure agreement of Level 4 clearance, thereby prohibiting the sharing of any privileged information. In the event Item #6226 violates the contract, Foundation personnel must delete the information and retrieve or eliminate the Journalist.
