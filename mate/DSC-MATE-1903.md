DSC-MATE-1903, designated as a Tiger humanoid specimen, is a Security Guard at this Foundation. His brawny build and sharp predatory senses are unparalleled among his peers. Interestingly enough, he dons a red cross earring and wears normal glasses, a stark contrast to his fierce appearance. 

DSC-MATE-1903’s impulsive nature is something to take note of. He can often be found chasing after his prey, whether it be a rogue Class D subject, or even an elusive candy stick. His tendency to act on his emotions presents a challenge to containment, but he has proven himself an asset in maintaining order. 

DSC-MATE-1903’s unpredictability is both his biggest strength and weakness. He can be a wild card in any given situation, but has a heart of gold and a sense of humor that can lighten the darkest of moods. Careful observation and management of DSC-MATE-1903 is essential, but his loyalty and protective instincts towards his fellow Foundation employees, as well as his love of candy, make him an invaluable member of the team.
