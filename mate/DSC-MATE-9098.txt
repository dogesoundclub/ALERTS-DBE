Description: Subject 9098 is a female human of average height and weight. Their face has distinctive orange stripes that are not a result of makeup, and their eyebrows are also orange in color. They have short, witch-like hair and wear a medical mask over their mouth as a fashion statement. Additionally, subject 9098 wears a gold chain around their neck, and gold earrings in both ears.

Subject 9098's profession is that of a beautician, and they are well-known for their traditional beauty techniques that have been passed down through their family and community. While they have a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to their work, they also have a playful side and enjoy telling jokes and sharing stories with those around them.
