Item #: 8755

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8755 is to be allowed to continue her job as a fast food worker with no interference from Foundation personnel. Close monitoring of her activities, however, is advised to ensure that her ability to connect with others does not extend beyond the realm of normal human interactions.

Description: Subject 8755 is a female human with normal glasses and distinctive accessories including a purple cap with a headset, green cross earrings, and a silver chain. Her most notable feature, however, is her ability to charm and connect with others in a way that is not typical of most humans.

Subject 8755's personality is infectious, often leading to humorous situations where she can get strangers to open up about their life stories or share funny anecdotes that bring people closer together. It is unknown if this ability is the result of a specific magical or anomalous effect, or if it is simply due to her unique personality.

Due to the potential for this ability to be exploited by outside forces, subject 8755 has been placed under ongoing surveillance.

Addendum 8755-1: Interview Log

Interviewer: Dr. ██████

Subject 8755: Good evening, Doctor! How can I help you today?

Dr. ██████: Can you describe your ability to connect with people in more detail?

Subject 8755: Well, I just have a way of talking to people that makes them feel at ease. I've always been a people person, I guess. I can usually tell from body language and facial expressions when someone is uneasy or uncomfortable, and I try to put them at ease.

Dr. ██████: Have you ever encountered someone you couldn't connect with?

Subject 8755: Not really. I mean, there are some people who try to put up walls and barriers, but I usually find ways to get through to them eventually. It's just a matter of understanding what's going on beneath the surface.

Dr. ██████: Do you think your ability could be used for dangerous purposes?

Subject 8755: I guess it's possible, but I don't really see how. I'm just a fast food worker, after all! But if you think there's something I should be looking out for, I'm happy to cooperate.
