Description: 7057 is a human female with distinctive facial features, including several spots and a purple lip. They possess an odd shaped head that is predominantly orange in color and they have one gold earring on their left ear. They work as a train driver, but are known to spend time lost in thought, often resulting in humorous accidents.

They have displayed a tendency to engage in deep thought at inappropriate times, often losing awareness of their surroundings. Despite this, they maintain a good sense of humor and do not take themselves too seriously. When not lost in thought, 7057 acts as a diligent and focused train driver.

Additional Notes: 7057 has displayed a resistance to certain types of mind-altering effects, but as of yet, the cause of this resistance is unknown. Testing is ongoing.
