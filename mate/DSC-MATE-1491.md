Description: DSC-MATE-1491 is a male Bengal tiger, standing approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing 180 kilograms. The subject's most notable feature is a perpetually frightened expression, as evidenced by the subject's mouth being slightly agape. DSC-MATE-1491's eyes are equipped with thick, nerd glasses and his head is adorned with unkempt, not arranged green hair. The subject's ears are pierced with a red cross earring.

DSC-MATE-1491 is primarily known for its occupation as a delivery driver, which is believed to be its cover in the human world. Despite its imposing size and appearance, DSC-MATE-1491 possesses a dry sense of humor that is often delivered in a deadpan manner. Personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-1491 should be cautious, as the subject has a tendency to catch people off guard with its wit.

DSC-MATE-1491 has yet to exhibit any anomalous abilities, and it is believed that the subject's unusual appearance is the result of genetic experimentation. Further research is required to determine the origin of DSC-MATE-1491 and the extent of its capabilities.

Addendum: During routine maintenance of DSC-MATE-1491's containment chamber, personnel discovered a medical mask in the subject's possession. It is unknown at this time whether the mask serves any purpose or if it is merely a fashion accessory. Further investigation is required.
