Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9450 is to be monitored at all times to ensure they adhere to their schedule and do not deviate from their designated train route. SCP-9450 is to be given regular mental health evaluations and any signs of deviation from their normal behavior are to be reported immediately.

SCP-9450 is to be provided access to a designated smoking area and is allowed to smoke one cigarette per hour during their train ride. Any attempts to deny them this access may result in erratic behavior.

Description: SCP-9450 is a female train driver with distinctive orange stripes on their face. Their red clown eyes and Tiara give them a unique appearance. They wear a red cross earring and a choker as accessories. SCP-9450 usually has a cigarette in hand while on duty.

SCP-9450 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards their job. They take their responsibility for their passengers' safety seriously and ensure that their train always arrives at its scheduled time. However, SCP-9450 also has a humorous side and enjoys entertaining their passengers during the ride. They often dance and sing along to music, encouraging the passengers to join in.

Personnel have noted that SCP-9450's behavior seems to change when they smoke. They become more focused and intense, often staring intently at the train tracks ahead. At times, SCP-9450 has been observed to mutter to themselves or speak in tongues while smoking.

SCP-9450 has expressed a strong disgust towards those who cause disruptions and delays. Personnel are advised to avoid any actions that may cause SCP-9450 to become upset, as their behavior may become unpredictable.

Addendum: SCP-9450 has been observed on several occasions to exhibit subtle reality-altering abilities. Passengers have reported that the train ride seems to pass much more quickly than expected, and that time appears to have passed differently while on the train. Further research is required to determine the extent of these abilities.
