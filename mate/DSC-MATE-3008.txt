Item #: SCP-3008

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3008 is to be housed within a secure facility and monitored at all times by Foundation personnel. Any attempts to tamper with or modify its programming must be reported immediately to the lead researcher.

Description: SCP-3008 is a male robot designed to appear as a humanoid police officer. It is equipped with a single green cyclops eye and VR rainbow LED eyes. SCP-3008 sports a police cap on its head, with a goggle on its forehead, and medical mask over its mouth.

SCP-3008 has a gold earring on one ear and a gold chain around its neck. It is highly capable and intelligent, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, this sense of duty can sometimes lead to SCP-3008 taking on more than it can handle, resulting in humorous situations.

Addendum: SCP-3008 has been designated as a reporter and may be used by the Foundation for investigative purposes. Its programming allows it to research and report on various subjects related to the paranormal, making it a valuable asset in the Foundation's efforts to contain and research anomalous phenomena. However, caution must be exercised, as SCP-3008's tendency to take on too much could potentially compromise its safety and the safety of Foundation personnel.
