Item #: SCP-3093

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3093 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. Due to the dangerous nature of SCP-3093's abilities, any personnel entering SCP-3093's chamber must be equipped with titanium-reinforced armor and equipped with .45 caliber pistols. Any interaction with SCP-3093 must be supervised by no fewer than two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3093 appears to be a male Bengal tiger with a height of 2.3 meters and weight of approximately 400 kg. The subject possesses a distinctive red scarf and cigarette which is always present in its mouth. SCP-3093 shows signs of extreme anxiety, often appearing frightened or distressed.

SCP-3093 has a unique ability to communicate with humanoid entities using spoken language, in particular English. This ability extends to the ability to read and write.

SCP-3093 has been observed to have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, particularly in its role as a licensed veterinarian. Despite its obvious species disadvantage (SCP-3093 is unable to make notes on paper or use a pen without assistance from handlers), it is extremely proficient in its field of veterinary medicine. SCP-3093 has been utilized successfully in numerous Foundation missions and is thought of by handlers as an important asset.

SCP-3093 has also been observed to possess a more humorous side, often leading to situations in which it is the life of the party, getting other personnel to dance and sing along to its favorite songs. Despite being a dangerous anomaly, SCP-3093 is considered to be an asset to the Foundation, as long as it is handled with extreme care.

Addendum: Dr. █████ reprimanded [DATA EXPUNGED] for allowing SCP-3093 access to Level-3 restricted documents. Personnel are reminded that SCPs are not colleagues and should not be treated as such. Any similar incidents will result in disciplinary action.
