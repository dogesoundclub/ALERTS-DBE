DSC-MATE-1964 is a humanoid entity of the human species, identified to be a car salesman in the urban setting. The subject bears several anomalous features on the face, including a prominent mouth spot and a clown mouth that appears to be permanently fixed in a wide smile. DSC-MATE-1964's blue clown eyes give off an unnerving stare, causing unease to those who interact with the subject. 

DSC-MATE-1964 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, adorned with a red victory band on the forehead, and a green cross earring on the ear, which is inexplicably immune to magnetic forces. The subject also sports a gold chain and a cigarette, which constantly emits smoke, with no apparent source of ignition. 

The subject's personality is particularly intriguing, displaying a high level of creativity and a vivid imagination. DSC-MATE-1964 has been observed indulging in peculiar hobbies, including writing poetry, crafting elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting rare or odd objects. These interests seem to have no correlation with the subject's car sales profession, raising concerns about the nature of DSC-MATE-1964's true intentions. 
 
Further investigation is ongoing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-1964's anomalous capabilities and potential threats to society. Until then, all interactions with DSC-MATE-1964 must be authorized and undertaken with extreme caution.
