Item #: 1106

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1106 is to be monitored at all times through surveillance cameras in their workplace and home. They are to be approached only by personnel wearing Level 2 gas masks and gloves. Subject's movements must be recorded and reported in detail to the Foundation. Any abnormal behavior or activity must be reported immediately to the supervisor on duty.

Description: Subject 1106, also known as the "Banker," is a human female of average height and build. They wear a purple cap with a headset over their black, straightened hair. One of their defining features is the purple shade of their lipstick. They also sport a goggle on their forehead for unknown reasons. Their ears are adorned with emerald green cross earrings, which contrast with their purple accessories. They wear a silver chain around their neck.

The Banker's personality is a force to be reckoned with. They harness a natural talent for leadership and gravitate towards taking control of situations. They often fill the role of leader or organizer within their professional and social circles, and they're not afraid to take charge in their personal life either. This behavior may indicate a desire for power and control, which is something to take note of.

Special Note: The Banker's use of a normal gas mask as an accessory is quite intriguing. It is unknown if it serves a purpose or is purely for aesthetic reasons. Further observation is recommended.
