Item #: 7020

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7020 is to be monitored at all times, and interactions should be kept to a minimum. Any deviations from their routine must be reported immediately to the Site Director for further analysis.

Description: Subject 7020 appears to be a normal human female in her mid-thirties, approximately 5'8" in height with blonde hair worn in a ushanka. However, upon closer examination, several distinct physical features and anomalies have been noted. Subject 7020 has spotted skin, which researchers have determined to be caused by a rare form of hyperpigmentation. They also have unnerving red clown eyes that seem to change color depending on their mood.

Subject 7020's personality has proven to be an additional complication. On one hand, they exhibit high levels of reliability and organization, making them an excellent banker. However, their stubbornness has also resulted in a difficulty accepting new ideas or changes in routine. This quality has shown to lead to humorous situations as they attempt to maintain their rigorous schedule.

Additionally, Subject 7020 wears a green cross earring in their left ear, which holds special significance but is currently not understood.

Addendum: Further research has resulted in the discovery of Subject 7020's ability to manipulate banking transactions. This ability is currently under investigation by Foundation researchers to determine its extent and possible risks. Any interactions with Subject 7020 must proceed with caution.
