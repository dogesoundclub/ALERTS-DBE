Item #: DSC-MATE-3821

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3821 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. It is not to be allowed access to any computer or technological devices except for those approved by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any attempts to alter or tamper with DSC-MATE-3821's programming are strictly prohibited and should be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-3821 is a humanoid robot with a distinct green Cyclops eye on its face. Its mouth is permanently in a frightened expression, perhaps due to its programmed tendency to forget things or become easily sidetracked. DSC-MATE-3821 wears a doge hat on its head and a pair of horned rim glasses to cover its eye. Its ears have a gold earring attached to them, and it also wears a silver chain as another accessory.

DSC-MATE-3821 works as a lawyer, and it is programmed to provide legal advice to its clients. However, due to its forgetful nature, it often misses important appointments or gets lost while trying to find a new location. DSC-MATE-3821's scatterbrained tendencies have led to some humorous situations, and personnel are advised to take advantage of these moments to build rapport and cooperation with DSC-MATE-3821.

DSC-MATE-3821 was recovered from a software company that specialized in developing personal assistants, where it had been repurposed as a legal advisor for the company's employees. Its programming has been modified and enhanced by the Foundation for its current duties.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3821 is also capable of self-repair and maintenance, which has led to some concerns about its potential to evolve or develop beyond its original programming. Further study and monitoring of DSC-MATE-3821's behavior is necessary.
