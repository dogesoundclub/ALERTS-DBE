Description: Subject 5277, also known to his colleagues as "Dr. Bananas," is a 5'5" bipedal monkey species. It displays human-like intelligence and the ability to speak fluent English. It wears a blue bandana on its head and nerdy glasses on its eyes, giving it a unique appearance. The subject's ears host a gold earring on the right ear, with a silver chain hanging around its neck. Most notably, it wears an LED gas mask to aid in breathing outside its natural environment, as well as to obscure its identity.

Personality: Subject 5277 has been deemed eccentric and sometimes forgetful, with a tendency to get sidetracked easily. Although its scatterbrained nature can be humorous, it also can hinder important responsibilities, such as forgetting appointments and important meetings. Whether this attributed behavior is a result of its monkey species or merely a product of its isolated lifestyle is unknown.

Additional Notes: Subject 5277's intelligence level exceeds that of the average monkey species but remains vague, as its origins and abilities are unknown. Subject 5277 has claimed to possess a high amount of capital and shown no guilt or remorse in unethical practices concerning its position in the banking industry. All attempts to identify its origins or acquaintance with outside parties remain unsuccessful. Further analysis is necessary.
