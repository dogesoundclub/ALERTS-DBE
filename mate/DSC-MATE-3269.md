Item #: DSC-MATE-3269

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3269 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All interactions with DSC-MATE-3269 must be done remotely, using surveillance cameras and intercom systems. Personnel must not come within 5 meters of DSC-MATE-3269 unless authorized by Level 4 clearance.

Description: DSC-MATE-3269 is a female human of average height and build. Her most notable features are the spots on her face, and the purple lip. DSC-MATE-3269's eyes are red and resemble those of a clown, and her head is green with curling edges. DSC-MATE-3269's forehead bears two colored bands, and she wears a medical mask over her mouth for unknown reasons. She also wears a silver chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-3269 is highly creative and possesses a vivid imagination, which has led to her developing several unusual hobbies and interests such as writing poetry, designing elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. However, DSC-MATE-3269's anomalous abilities are yet to be deduced but they are believed to pose a potential threat.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3269 was initially discovered working as a reporter for a local news outlet, where she displayed no abnormal behavior. However, she became a person of interest when she began broadcasting a series of strange, cryptic messages through the airwaves. The Foundation intercepted these broadcasts, and an investigation was launched, which led to DSC-MATE-3269's containment. All broadcasting equipment in DSC-MATE-3269's possession has been confiscated.

Due to the potential threat DSC-MATE-3269 poses, all interviews and interactions are to be conducted remotely using appropriate technology to limit any potential anomalies. Further testing is ongoing.
