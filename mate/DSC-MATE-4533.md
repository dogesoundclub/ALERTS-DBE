Description: Subject 4533 is a human male, identified as a veterinarian. The subject’s most notable facial feature is a pattern of spots, which are commonly seen in felines or canines. The subject’s eyes resemble ski goggles, and they often wear a medical mask over their humorous smile. They can be seen wearing a blue bandana around their head, with a green cross earring dangling from their left ear. Subject 4533 always wears an ornate silver chain, which appears to have some sentimental value.

The subject advised that he was able to communicate with the cats, and orchestrated their return to containment. Investigation is currently ongoing, as the ability to communicate with anomalous entities is a clear indication that Subject 4533 will require further observation by the Foundation.
