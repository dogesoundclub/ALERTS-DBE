Item #: 2677

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2677 is to be kept under constant surveillance at all times. It is to be housed in a secure containment chamber, and any interaction with it should be conducted by at least 2 personnel wearing level 4 containment suits.

Description: Item #2677 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighing 34 kg. It possesses a pair of horned rim glasses over its eyes, and a two-color band on its forehead.

In addition to that, it wears a jade earring in its left ear and can always be seen carrying a candy stick as an accessory. Item #2677 is a highly intelligent, highly social, and highly manipulative creature. 

Personality tests performed on this creature have shown that it is highly nurturing, often anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, giving them names, and talking to them as if they were alive.

Its powers of persuasion are considerable, as it is often able to convince others (even humans) to do its bidding. This has resulted in several incidents where Item #2677 has been able to gain access to restricted areas or obtain certain materials.

It is currently posing as a real estate agent, and surveillance has revealed that it has been selling properties all over the city to various entities, both living and dead. Due to the highly manipulative nature of this creature, it is highly recommended that personnel not interact with it unless absolutely necessary.

Addendum: Item #2677's increased reliance on anthropomorphizing inanimate objects has led to an increased risk of containment breach. Personnel are advised to stay alert and report any signs of increased activity from the creature immediately.
