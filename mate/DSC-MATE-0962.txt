SCP-962, designated to the Electrician role, is a male human with distinctive features. His face consists of a mouth spot and a frightened mouth, causing discomfort and uneasiness upon direct eye contact. SCP-962 often hides his face behind a medical mask to avoid any unwanted interactions with others. 

Observations indicated that SCP-962 has a fixation towards details, often obsessing over color-coding his closet or alphabetizing his spice rack. This personality trait can manifest in unexpected ways, leading to disruptive behavior and disruptions in his assigned tasks.

SCP-962 wears a headset with a LED light, allowing the creature to work even in low lighting conditions. His accessory, a red scarf, enhances his confidence and gives him a sense of protection against the outside world. 

SCP-962's role as an electrician should be monitored and limited to critical tasks only, given his behavioral tendencies. Any disruption in operations should be reported immediately to the assigned Site Supervisor.
