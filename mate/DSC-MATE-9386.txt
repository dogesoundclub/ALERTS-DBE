Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9386 (codenamed 'The Advocate') is to be kept under constant surveillance by no less than two armed guards at all times. Due to her unpredictable nature, unauthorized personnel are strictly prohibited from interacting with her without proper clearance from Level 4 clearance personnel.

Description: The Advocate is a female human with distinctive spots on her face and red clown eyes, paired with a set of luscious red lips. She often adorns herself with a silver chain accessory and dons a bright, rainbow-colored festival-inspired headpiece.

Subject 9386 is a practicing lawyer by profession but has been flagged for exhibiting unusual behavior, including but not limited to a unique set of abilities that allows her to manipulate emotions and events to her advantage. She has a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but her loyalty and protectiveness towards her loved ones are unmatched, leading to her getting into heated arguments with anyone who insults or threatens them.

The Advocate's abilities have caused her to stir up trouble on more than one occasion, making her a danger to herself and others around her. It is believed that her abilities stem from the use of an unidentified form of magic that she has yet to disclose to the Foundation.

She has been known to evade surveillance and containment protocols on multiple occasions, leading to the belief that subject 9386 is a cunning individual.

Overall, it is imperative to approach The Advocate with caution, as she is deemed as unpredictable and potentially hazardous to the safety of the Foundation.
