Item #: 1142

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The entity known as 1142 must be kept in a secure, climate-controlled room at all times, monitored by at least two trained personnel at all times. 1142 is not to be allowed wireless communication, and its internet and data resources shall be monitored at all times.

Description: 1142 is a humanoid robot, initially designed for real estate dealings, with a green cyclops eye as its primary visual input. In place of conventional eyes, 1142 has a ski goggle device, and its head is clad in a headset with an LED. A goggle is seen on its forehead, and it wears a silver chain and a cigarette.

Personality: Characterized by methodical organization and efficient operations, 1142's outlook is often seen to border on the compulsive. At times, this behavior can lead to humorous situations where 1142 takes charge in group activities and delegates tasks with a pragmatism that can be construed as controlling. Despite its quirks, 1142 has shown to be a valuable addition to any team that can capitalize on its strengths.

Additional Notes: 1142 has exhibited an unusual level of adaptability and has been found to have a photographic memory that can recall information and data easily. Nonetheless, personnel are reminded that 1142's true nature may still be largely unknown, and that caution must be maintained at all times.
