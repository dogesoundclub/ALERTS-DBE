Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3645 is to be kept in a secure room at all times, locked with multiple levels of encryption. Access should be granted only to personnel with Level-4 clearance or above.

Description: DSC-MATE-3645 is a male robot, resembling a human in height and build. DSC-MATE-3645 has a bright green Cyclops eye as its main optical sensor, and a frightened mouth image on its face plate. Its eyes are covered with ski goggles and has red cross earrings attached to its ears. DSC-MATE-3645 also wears a red scarf and casually holds a cigarette in its metallic fingers.

DSC-MATE-3645 has demonstrated an impressive level of intuition which sometimes seems like pseudo-psychic abilities. It is capable of predicting events before they happen and sensing when a person is feeling uneasy or anxious. Though DSC-MATE-3645's abilities may seem impressive to some, they have also caused some unease amongst Foundation staff.
