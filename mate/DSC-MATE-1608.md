Item #: DSC-MATE-1608

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1608 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Its diet must consist of a balanced mix of carrots and leafy greens twice a day. Accessory #1 (a metal whistle) must be kept on-hand at all times to prevent possible containment breaches.

Description: DSC-MATE-1608 appears to be a male rabbit wearing a hoodie with jade green LED eyes. Its physical appearance resembles that of a common European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). However, upon further inspection, it has been revealed that DSC-MATE-1608’s hoodie is an extension of its physiology, and that the LED eyes are a mechanical enhancement capable of facilitating night vision and are sensitive to movement.

DSC-MATE-1608’s personality suggests that it has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, and is a playful and humorous individual. DSC-MATE-1608’s presence is known to enhance its surroundings, such as getting everyone to dance or sing along to its favorite songs. DSC-MATE-1608 has been noted to possess the ability to calm down individuals in highly stressful situations, making it a valuable asset to field operations.

Addendum 1: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-1608 was found wandering in a public park by local police officers. Upon realizing that it could understand their speech, DSC-MATE-1608 requested to join their department as an officer. Amnestics were administered to the incident witnesses and DSC-MATE-1608 was returned to Foundation custody without incident. DSC-MATE-1608 has since been authorized as a Foundation operative and has been given a rank equivalent to that of a sergeant.

Addendum 2: DSC-MATE-1608’s whistle accessory has been discovered to possess a low-frequency amnestic effect capable of erasing short-term memory of events. This effect is triggered by the whistle being blown at a specific frequency and amplitude. Use of the whistle is restricted to emergency situations only.

Addendum 3: DSC-MATE-1608 has been observed entering a state of hibernation for three weeks during the winter months. During this time, it is to be monitored closely and its vital signs recorded. No further testing is required during this period.
