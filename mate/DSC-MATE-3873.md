Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3873 is to be monitored at all times and kept in a humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No physical contact is allowed with DSC-MATE-3873 unless authorized by Level 4 personnel or higher. As an intelligent and speech-capable humanoid, DSC-MATE-3873 may be granted access to limited entertainment and reading materials as long as they have been screened for any potential anomalous effects. 

Description: DSC-MATE-3873 is a male monkey of indeterminate species, standing at approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) in height. Its eyes are replaced with Virtual Reality Rainbow LED devices and it wears a bucket hat on its head. DSC-MATE-3873 possesses a gold earring on its left ear and is frequently seen smoking cigarettes. DSC-MATE-3873 is proficient in speaking several human languages and has a charming personality that has been noted as both funny and uncanny. DSC-MATE-3873 is also well-versed in politics and has successfully run for and won elections in several countries. 

DSC-MATE-3873 is highly protective of its loved ones and friends, and will not hesitate to engage in arguments or physical altercations if it feels they have been insulted. Although DSC-MATE-3873 appears to be laid-back and easy-going, its protective instincts can escalate to a dangerous level if pushed far enough. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3873 was discovered in [REDACTED], where it had entrenched itself in the political scene under the guise of a charismatic and well-regarded individual. It was eventually brought to the attention of the Foundation by a whistleblower who had worked with DSC-MATE-3873 in the past. DSC-MATE-3873 was subdued and transported to Site-██ for containment. The Foundation is currently conducting ongoing research to determine the source and extent of DSC-MATE-3873's anomalous properties.
