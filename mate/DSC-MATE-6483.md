CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

DSC-MATE-6483 is to be contained in a standard human containment cell and monitored at all times by at least one Level 2 staff member. DSC-MATE-6483's personal belongings are to be confiscated and securely stored within the facility. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-6483 must be supervised and recorded.

DESCRIPTION:

DSC-MATE-6483 is a female human of average height and weight. DSC-MATE-6483 bears blue clown eyes and a pair of jade earrings in its ears. DSC-MATE-6483 also wears a gold chain as an accessory, and is often seen with a cigarette in its hand. DSC-MATE-6483's occupation is that of a veterinarian.

DSC-MATE-6483 displays an acute level of observation skills and holds a strong focus on detail, making it an exceptional gift-giver. However, it may become overly preoccupied with selecting the "perfect" gift, often spending a considerable amount of time fretting over what to choose and where to find it.

DSC-MATE-6483 is not known to exhibit any anomalous traits or behaviors. However, its close attention to detail and observational nature make it a potential security risk if left unmonitored.

ADDENDUM:

During a routine check of DSC-MATE-6483's cell, staff noted a significant number of handmade origami figures scattered throughout the room. It is currently unclear if this indicates any potential anomalous ability or if it is simply a personal hobby. Further investigation is required.
