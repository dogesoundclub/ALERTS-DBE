Item #: DSC-MATE-6940

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6940 is to be monitored at all times and must keep a low profile to remain undetected by the general public. Any sudden changes in demeanor or behavior must be reported to the Foundation immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-6940 appears to be a human female of average height and weight, with an unusual appearance. She sports purple lips and spots on her face, and her eyes resemble those of a clown, being bright blue in color. Her head is covered in blue metal that can not be removed. DSC-MATE-6940 always wears gold earrings, a silver chain, and a goggle on her forehead.

DSC-MATE-6940's personality is characterized by her analytical and logical nature, often engaging in heated arguments and debates over trivial matters. Despite her quirky and humorous behavior, DSC-MATE-6940 is a skilled real estate agent, able to persuade and convince clients to buy properties using her logical arguments.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6940 has shown an unusual resilience to physical damage. While investigating her, Foundation agents attempted to break the metal covering her head. However, it proved to be indestructible and could not be removed from DSC-MATE-6940's head. We are uncertain of the purpose of this metal cover and are continuing to research this matter.
