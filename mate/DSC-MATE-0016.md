Description: DSC-MATE-16 is a humanoid male identified as a doctor. His face features a unique mark on his mouth, and he possesses a smile that seems to be permanently etched onto his face. DSC-MATE-16's most striking feature, however, are his blue clown-like eyes, which have been observed to glow under certain lighting conditions.

DSC-MATE-16's head is adorned with a blue bandana, and he wears a gold earring in one ear. He is often seen with a silver chain hanging from his neck. Despite his unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-16 is a completely human entity, and all attempts to determine the cause behind his anomalous characteristics have been inconclusive.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-16 is known to be extremely outgoing and sociable, often drawing attention to himself with his humor and storytelling. Personnel who come into contact with him often find themselves unable to resist his charisma, and have been observed to laugh uncontrollably at his jokes and anecdotes.

However, there have been reports of DSC-MATE-16's behavior taking a darker turn, particularly when he feels threatened or cornered. In such situations, he has been known to exhibit abilities beyond that of a normal human, including inciting hallucinations, and inducing vomiting or fainting in those he perceives as threats.

Currently, research into DSC-MATE-16's abilities and origins is ongoing. Until further notice, all personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with this entity.
