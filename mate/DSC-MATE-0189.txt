Item #: SCP-189

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-189 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with a feeding area and a sleeping area. The feeding area will contain a selection of fruits and vegetables, along with a daily multivitamin supplement, to meet SCP-189's dietary needs. The sleeping area shall contain a standard cot. SCP-189 is not to be allowed access to any medical supplies or equipment unless authorized by a Level 3 supervisor.

Description: SCP-189 is a male monkey with red clown eyes. SCP-189 has a retro cap on its head and a two-color band on its forehead. It is also adorned with a gold earring in each ear and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-189 exhibits a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge of situations.

SCP-189 is able to speak and understands several languages, including English, Spanish, and French. SCP-189 has claimed to hold a Doctorate in medicine, although no records to support this claim have been found. SCP-189 has displayed the ability to diagnose illnesses and injuries in other SCP subjects and non-anomalous individuals, seemingly using its own natural senses.

SCP-189's personality is domineering and confident. SCP-189 often asserts its dominance over other SCPs and personnel, demanding respect and loyalty. SCP-189 has shown a particular interest in the field of medicine and has requested access to medical supplies and equipment on several occasions. These requests have been denied due to SCP-189's anomalous nature and the risk of misuse.

Addendum: Following Incident-189-A, SCP-189's requests for medical supplies and equipment have been permanently denied. All requests must be reviewed and signed off by a Level 3 supervisor. SCP-189's anomalous nature presents a danger to both itself and others, and all interactions must be closely monitored.
