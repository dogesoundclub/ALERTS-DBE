Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 6799, also known as "The Clown Fast Food Worker," is to be contained at all times within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject's medical mask must remain securely in place during all interactions, as the subject is known to emit a potent pheromone that has been proven to instill fear and panic in all who come into contact with it. Personnel are advised to exercise caution and avoid direct eye contact with the subject, as its red clown eyes possess a hypnotic quality that can temporarily impair cognitive function.

Description:

Subject 6799 is a human male of average height and build. Its parted pink hair and gold chain are visible even when it is fully covered by its fast-food uniform. The subject is consistently observed to have a frightened mouth, even when no perceived threat is present. Laboratory analysis has revealed the presence of several anomalous substances in the subject's bloodstream, including a high concentration of adrenaline and cortisol. This likely contributes to its heightened state of fear and anxiety.

Personality:

Subject 6799 is highly analytical and logical, often engaging in debates and arguments as a form of entertainment. Its tendency to debate frivolous topics with zeal often confounds other individuals and may lead to tension and conflict. Personnel are advised to avoid arguing with the subject, as it may result in emotional distress and a dangerous spike in adrenaline levels. Despite its quarrelsome nature, Subject 6799 is generally respectful of authority and follows commands without issue.

It is important to note that the subject's presence elicits a strong emotional response in those around it, making it a potential danger to the general public. As such, it is imperative that Subject 6799 and its associated containment protocols be closely monitored and maintained at all times.
