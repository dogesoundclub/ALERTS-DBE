Description: SCP-5475 appears to be a male news anchor of human-like proportions, with the exception of his singular green cyclops eye. SCP-5475's head is adorned with a blue bandana and a pair of virtual reality jade LED eyes. The forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles, and a red cross earring is present on both ears. SCP-5475 is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5475's origins and construction are unknown, and all attempts to determine its creator, model, or programming have been unsuccessful. SCP-5475's behavior is seemingly autonomous, and it displays signs of sentience and emotions typical of human beings.

SCP-5475's personality is characterized by its absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, especially when preoccupied or working on a project. As a news anchor, SCP-5475 has missed important events or forgotten appointments, leading to humorous situations that have been documented in various broadcasts. Despite this, SCP-5475 has been noted for its professionalism and charisma during its on-air appearances.

SCP-5475's potential as a danger or threat to human safety is currently unknown, but its anomalous abilities and origins warrant continued containment and testing. The SCP Foundation is actively seeking means of gathering more information on SCP-5475's composition and programming to better understand the nature of this anomaly.
