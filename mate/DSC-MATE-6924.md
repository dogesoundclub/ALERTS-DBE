Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6924 is contained within Site-██, and is allowed to practice her veterinary job under close supervision. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-6924 requires prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-6924 appears to be a human female, approximately 26 years of age. She has a unique facial feature - red lips - which are coated with an unidentified pigment. DSC-MATE-6924's eyes are circular VR Jade LEDs, that shine iridescent shades of green. The anatomy of her head is likewise unusual in that it possesses an arrangement of green foliage which appears neither natural nor genetically tweaked.

DSC-MATE-6924 generally behaves congruent with that of a standard human being, but she exhibits a peculiar trait - she is frequently lost in thought or daydreaming. This can be manifested as a degree of absentmindedness, in which she is prone to colliding with objects or stumbling, as though she is not registering their presence.

Such a characteristic, though relatively benign, must be obstructed to others, as open disclosure of the DogeSoundClub and its secrets to outsiders can threaten our safety and further containment procedures.

Personality: DSC-MATE-6924 is an enigmatic individual, whose mind appears to be inscrutable. They tend to be very introspective and may spend a lot of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This can sometimes lead to embarrassing situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

Despite her quirks, DSC-MATE-6924's innate skill as a veterinarian is unparalleled. Her ability to empathize with animals is outstanding and has proven useful in many containment operations. DSC-MATE-6924 is cooperative and open to suggestions regarding her performance within the Foundation.

Addendum: Given DSC-MATE-6924's unique visual modifications and unexplained head structure, a thorough physical examination revealed contraband genetic modifications, rooting out the necessary information may have helpful insights that could benefit containment efforts in future occurrences.
