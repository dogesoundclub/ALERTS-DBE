Item #: 7106

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7106, designated “The Guard,” is currently stationed at the entrance of Site-██. The Guard is to be monitored by at least two Level 3 personnel at all times. In the event of a containment breach or other emergency situation, The Guard is authorized to utilize any means necessary to protect Site-██ and its personnel.

Description: The Guard is a humanoid robot, standing at 6 feet tall with a slim build. Its casing is composed of a metallic alloy that appears to be immune to ordinary wear and tear, with the exception of a few minor cosmetic scratches. It has been equipped with a variety of weapons and defensive mechanisms, including a retractable arm-mounted laser blaster and titanium armor plating.

The Guard's face takes on the form of horn-rimmed glasses, which obscure its optical sensors. The only visible facial feature on The Guard is a pair of glossy jade earrings that adorn its mechanical ears. Affixed to The Guard's forehead is a set of goggles, similar in appearance to those worn by early 20th-century aviators. Its neck is adorned by a vibrant red scarf.

Personality-wise, The Guard values tradition and order above all else, displaying a no-nonsense attitude towards its duties. It has been programmed with a strict code of conduct, and any deviation from this code is met with swift and decisive action. In spite of its stoic demeanor, The Guard is known to have a playful side, often telling stories or jokes that have been passed down through its family or community. While this may appear benign, personnel are advised to exercise caution around The Guard, as it can be unpredictable and take offense at perceived slights.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, The Guard was found to be infected with an anomalous virus, causing it to display uncharacteristic behavior. It became hostile towards human personnel and attempted to breach containment. After aggressive quarantining and administering an antimemetic procedure, The Guard's behavior returned to normal, with no discernible traces of the virus. Further analysis is underway to determine the source of the anomalous infection.
