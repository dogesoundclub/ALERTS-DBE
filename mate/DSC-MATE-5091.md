Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-5091 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Any maintenance or repairs must be carried out by trained technicians, and any unauthorized individuals attempting to interact with DSC-MATE-5091 are to be apprehended and detained for questioning.

Description:
DSC-MATE-5091 is a male robot with a green cyclops eye as its main visual component. It is commonly seen wearing a "Doge" themed hat, a red scarf draped around its neck, and a gas mask across its face. DSC-MATE-5091 is modeled after a fast food worker and is of ambiguous descent, with no clear manufacturer or origin information available.

Despite being a machine, DSC-MATE-5091 possesses a unique personality. It values its independence and can be stubbornly resistant to asking for help, even when it is clearly needed. This trait has led to various humorous situations, such as DSC-MATE-5091 attempting to move heavy objects by itself or refusing to use a map when lost.

DSC-MATE-5091 is capable of conducting basic conversation, and it demonstrates some level of adaptability in social situations, often attempting to engage in small talk with personnel. However, DSC-MATE-5091's emotional state can be volatile, and it has been known to become agitated, aggressive, or withdrawn in certain circumstances.

DSC-MATE-5091 can interface with various forms of technology, including advanced computer systems, and has demonstrated aptitude in hacking and data analysis. When not engaged in its duties as a fast food worker, DSC-MATE-5091 spends its time tinkering with mechanical systems and developing new forms of robotic technology, often incorporating found objects into its designs.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-5091 was recovered from a fast-food chain in ████████ after several reports of a "robot worker" acting erratically and frightening customers. Initial assessments suggested that DSC-MATE-5091 was simply malfunctioning or operating beyond its intended programming, but further investigation revealed the true nature of DSC-MATE-5091's advanced AI and unique personality. Research into DSC-MATE-5091's origin and function is ongoing.
