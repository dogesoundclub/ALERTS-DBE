Item #: 6335

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained within a secure facility fitted with climbing structures and various enrichment items designed to keep them occupied. Any clothing designed by the subject must be thoroughly tested for any potential anomalous properties before release to the public.

Description: Item 6335, also known as "The Fashion Designer", is a male monkey of an unknown origin. The subject stands approximately 0.6 meters in height, with a distinctive blue bandana covering its head and jade earrings adorning its ears. The subject's most notable form of identification is a pair of ski goggle eyes, which seem to possess an innate ability to perceive the colors, patterns, and fabrics in a way unlike any human. The subject is typically adorned with a silver chain and a candy stick as accessories.

Observations of the Fashion Designer have noted an abnormally high level of energy and enthusiasm, particularly towards novelties, which has led to many humorous interactions with those around it. The subject seems particularly invested in the creation of clothing articles, even going so far as to develop new textiles themselves. Despite the subject's intelligence, its communication skills are limited, making any meaningful conversation near impossible.

Addendum: It is of utmost importance that the subject does not come into contact with any particularly stimulating stimuli or objects in their immediate surroundings. Such exposure has been noted to cause a significant increase in the subject's metabolic activity, often resulting in large-scale, unintended fashion experiments. Subjects in the vicinity are advised to limit interaction with the item and to avoid encouraging their excitable disposition.
