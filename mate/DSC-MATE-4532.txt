SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-4532 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall when upright. Identification is confirmed through the presence of a blue bandana on its head and a red cross earring in its left ear. Its eyes are currently unknown, as they are almost always obscured by a medical mask worn over its mouth.

While initially discovered working as a reporter, SCP-4532 has since displayed a strong sense of independence and a rebellious streak that often leads to conflicts with authority. It has been observed to engage in behavior such as sneaking out of its office early or taking days off without proper permission.

While its behavior may be considered uncooperative, SCP-4532 has proven to be otherwise harmless and cooperative with Foundation personnel. It is currently being held in a containment cell in Site-██ and is undergoing further evaluation.
