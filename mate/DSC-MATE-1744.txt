Description: 

Subject 1744 is a human female with a tendency towards nurturing and protective behavior. However, her criminal record as a Mafia Boss is of extreme concern. Subject 1744's complexion exhibits orange stripes across her face and is often seen wearing a red lip. Her eyes are a bright, almost glowing red that change in intensity based on her mood, with elongated pupils resembling those of a clown. 

Subject 1744's physical features are reminiscent of a 00s School Girl, with gold earrings each in the shape of an angel's wing. She is often seen sporting a silver chain, which lends to her fierce reputation as a Mafia Boss. 

One of the most disturbing aspects of 1744's personality is her tendency to anthropomorphize objects, including her plants or household appliances. It is not uncommon for 1744 to give objects names and converse with them. This attachment extends even to inanimate objects, which have been witnessed being used as weapons in her criminal dealings. 

Addendum:

Subject 1744 is deemed a serious threat to society. Due to her manipulating personality, supposed nurturing nature and her skill in the criminal underworld, containment and surveillance must continue indefinitely.
