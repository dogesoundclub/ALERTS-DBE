Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4287 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with access to basic amenities such as food, water, and hygiene.

All personnel are mandated to avoid direct interaction with DSC-MATE-4287 except for research purposes deemed necessary by authorized personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-4287 is a human male with spots on his face, frightened mouth, and red clown eyes that are consistently present on its face. Its head is not arranged in a normal fashion and appears to be green. There is a two-color band on its forehead and jade earrings that are pierced through its ears.

DSC-MATE-4287 has shown no anomalous abilities as of yet, but its personality traits and tendencies have led to its containment. It displays an overwhelming love for adventure and has shown no fear of trying new things, even when they may result in injury or death. It has survived bungee jumping accidents and getting lost in the wilderness, leading to several humorous stories.

Interaction with DSC-MATE-4287 has shown that it is compliant with requests made by personnel, but it may attempt to persuade them to allow for more adventurous activities or use of equipment that could lead to dangerous situations. The presence of a candy stick seems to have a calming effect on DSC-MATE-4287 and is recommended as a way to prevent any attempts at escape or agitation.

Addendum: Due to its risky nature, DSC-MATE-4287 is to be monitored closely and any requests for potentially dangerous activities are to be denied. It is advised that all personnel remain vigilant and alert when interacting with DSC-MATE-4287.
