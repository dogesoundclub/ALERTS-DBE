Item #: 1373

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 1373 is allowed to continue operating as a train driver, as its functions have been deemed safe for human interaction. However, personnel interacting with 1373 must wear protective gear and stay vigilant at all times.

Description: 1373 is a male robot train driver with a frightened mouth and horned-rim glasses serving on the urban railroad. Its head is adorned with a red beanie, and its mouth is fitted with a medical mask, which it wears at all times. While its appearance seems docile, 1373 is highly observant and attentive to details, providing the perfect opportunity for personnel to receive a thoughtful gift. However, its obsession with providing the "perfect" gift can lead to overzealousness.

Personality: 1373's creator designed it with meticulous care, imbuing it with an overabundance of empathetic traits. This design flaw often makes 1373 anxious and preoccupied with the need to cater to others' needs and anticipate their desires, which can be a burden. Nonetheless, its personality makes 1373 an excellent gift giver, and its functionality is unparalleled when it comes to its duties as a train driver.

Addendum 1373-1: After the breakdown of 1373's creator, the robot has exhibited unusual behavior, which is of concern to Foundation personnel. Its devotion to gift-giving has been exacerbated, showing signs of recklessness in its pursuit of the perfect gift. Personnel must monitor 1373's activities and behavior to ensure its functionality and safety to other personnel.
