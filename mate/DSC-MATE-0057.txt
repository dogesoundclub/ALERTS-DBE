Item #: SCP-57

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-57 is to be confined to a secure, temperature-controlled containment chamber at all times when not in use. The robot must be inspected regularly by maintenance personnel for any signs of malfunction or tampering, and any issues must be reported immediately to site supervisors.

SCP-57 may be activated for transport purposes only under the direct supervision of at least two Level 3 researchers. No unauthorized personnel are allowed within 50 meters of the containment area while SCP-57 is operational.

Description: SCP-57 is a robotic train driver designed for heavy-duty transport tasks. The entity stands at approximately 6 feet in height and weighs roughly 300 pounds. Its metallic shell is coated with a layer of reflective silver, and it has a pair of humanoid arms and legs that are capable of locomotion. The entity's face is concealed behind a pair of thick, rectangular nerd glasses.

SCP-57's primary accessory is a silver chain that hangs around its neck, along with a jade earring worn in one of its ears. It is often observed smoking a cigarette, despite lacking the biological needs of organic entities.

SCP-57 possesses an ambitious and goal-driven personality, often striving to accomplish more than what would be deemed practical or achievable by conventional standards. Its exceptional strategic thinking and organizational skills often enable it to achieve its ambitious goals. However, failure to accomplish a task can lead to increasingly erratic and unstable behavior, posing a risk to anyone in its vicinity.

SCP-57's anomalous abilities are currently not well understood, but it has shown the capability to control and manipulate electronic devices within its proximity. Further tests are being conducted to determine the scope and limitations of these abilities.

Note: SCP-57 was recovered from an abandoned research facility after reports of unauthorized activities were noticed via remote surveillance. It is believed that the entity was involved in the illicit activities carried out in the facility, although its precise role remains unknown. Investigation into its origin and creator is ongoing.
