Special Containment Procedures: The individual bearing the designation 4755 is to be monitored closely for any signs of psychological distress. Counseling is to be made available to them should their empathetic and compassionate nature become overwhelming. Any personal information or documentation containing identifying information is to remain confidential to prevent exploitation by outside individuals or organizations. 

Description: 4755 is a human female with a distinct orange stripe pattern on her face, red lips, and bright orange eyebrows. On her head sits the likeness of a pink rabbit with a fluffy tail. These physical features, while unusual, are not anomalous in nature. It is her personality that has garnered the attention of Foundation personnel. 

4755 is highly empathetic and compassionate, often taking on the emotional burdens of those around her. Her desire to fix others has also included instances of self-sacrifice, making her a valuable asset to any organization seeking cooperation and teamwork. However, her dedication to fixing the problems of others has been known to lead to feelings of exhaustion and burnout. 

Addendum: 4755 came to the attention of the Foundation after an encounter with a suspected anomalous entity. Following the incident, the individual requested anonymity and was offered a job as an investigative reporter. Since then, she has proven invaluable in gathering information about anomalous phenomena while also providing insight into the human element of these encounters. Further testing and observation are ongoing.
