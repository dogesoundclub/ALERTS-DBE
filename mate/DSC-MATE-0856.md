Description: DSC-MATE-856 is a female human with unusual physical features. The subject has orange stripes on her face, a tiara on her head, and red cross earrings. DSC-MATE-856's eyes are replaced with virtual reality jade LED, and she frequently wears a medical mask over her mouth. She also wears a silver chain around her neck.

DSC-MATE-856 is a highly empathetic individual who has the ability to sense and interpret the emotions of others. She often uses this skill to help people in difficult situations, providing comfort and support where needed. DSC-MATE-856 has shown no malicious intent, and seems to genuinely want to help those around her.

However, DSC-MATE-856's abilities are closely linked to her electrical wiring.
