Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4403 requires no special containment procedures, but should be monitored for any signs of emotionally charged behavior that may endanger themselves or others. Any behavioral changes should be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 4403 is a human male known for his distinctive purple cap and green cross earring. He is employed as a traffic officer, tasked with ensuring the smooth flow of vehicles and pedestrians in heavily congested urban areas.

Subject 4403 possesses a unique personality, characterized by an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He is often seen carrying books, documentaries, and other educational materials, and loves to share newfound knowledge with others. This passion for knowledge has led to an extensive collection of information on obscure topics that have no apparent relevance to his job.

Despite his unusual interests, Subject 4403 is a dedicated and efficient traffic officer. He uses his knowledge of human behavior to anticipate and prevent accidents, earning the respect and admiration of his colleagues and the public.

DogeSoundClub personnel speculate that Subject 4403's obsession with knowledge may be linked to his unique headwear and earring, which may have been imbued with anomalous properties. Further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Addendum: Subject 4403 has expressed an interest in joining the Foundation's research division. While this request has not been granted at this time, his knowledge and passion make him a valuable asset to the organization, should he ever be recruited.
