Addendum: Interview Log 2613-1

Interviewer: Dr. ██████
Interviewee: SCP-2613

Dr. ██████: Good morning, SCP-2613. How are you feeling today?

SCP-2613: Fine, doctor. Just trying to stay busy.

Dr. ██████: I understand. Can you tell me a little bit about your job here?

SCP-2613: Sure thing. I work the counter, take orders, make change, that sort of thing. Been doing it for years.

Dr. ██████: Do you enjoy your work?

SCP-2613: I take pride in what I do. Plus, it's steady work, and it keeps me busy.

Dr. ██████: I see. And can you tell me a little bit about your family or community?

SCP-2613: Heh, now that's a loaded question. My family's been here for generations, and we've always been part of the town. We got our own traditions and ways of doing things.

Dr. ██████: That's interesting. Can you give me an example of one of your traditions?

SCP-2613: Oh, sure. One thing we do is tell stories. Passed down through generations, you know? Some of them are funny, some of them are scary. But they all got a lesson in them.

Dr. ██████: I see. And how does telling stories help your community?

SCP-2613: Well, it brings us together, for one thing. And it helps remind us of where we came from. Plus, it's just fun.

Dr. ██████: Thank you, SCP-2613. That's all for now.

SCP-2613: No problem, doc. Good luck with the rest of your research.
