Item #: 7959

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7959 is to be kept in a standard human-sized containment chamber furnished with furniture and fixtures suitable for a rabbit. The chamber must provide ample space for exercise and have a source of fresh water and organic food. Subject 7959 is to undergo regular health checkups by a licensed veterinarian.

Description: Subject 7959 is a male rabbit standing at three feet tall. It wears a purple cap with a headset and has a two-color band on its forehead. Its eyes are covered with normal glasses, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. It's also frequently seen carrying a candy stick as an accessory.

Subject 7959 is an anomaly in that it displays an uncommon attachment to inanimate objects. It expresses a very nurturing and caring attitude towards these objects, often giving them names and talking to them as if they were sentient. This behavior extends to the point of anthropomorphizing household appliances, which subject 7959 tends to have in its containment chamber, giving them names and personalities. 

Subject 7959 has expressed an interest in being a firefighter and has been trained to assist in firefighting operations. Its small size and nimble movements make it suitable for accessing tight spaces and extinguishing fires. Careful monitoring is to be administered to avoid any harm to subject 7959 while performing its duties.

Addendum: In light of subject 7959's caring personality, it might be a useful addition to any containment chamber of sentient objects that exhibit loneliness or psychological distress. However, the ethics of such an arrangement warrant further discussion.
