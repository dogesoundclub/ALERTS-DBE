Item #: 9108

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9108 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of SCP-9108's abilities, no physical contact is to be made with it by any personnel at any time. Only remote communication through an intermediary device or via closed-circuit cameras may be used to communicate with SCP-9108.

Description: SCP-9108 appears to be a humanoid rabbit creature standing approximately 5 feet tall. It wears a distinct retro cap on its head, along with a pair of Ski goggles tightly wrapped around its eyes. SCP-9108 has an unusual gold earring on each of its ears, which could possibly be associated with its culture, species, or affiliation with a particular group. On its forehead, SCP-9108 has a goggle, functioning as a secondary visual aid. It sports an LED gas mask as its accessory, which appears to function as an additional layer of protection against unknown factors.

The anomalous properties of SCP-9108 manifest when it makes direct physical contact with other entities, living or otherwise. SCP-9108's touch can induce instantaneous laughter in its victim, causing the body to uncontrollably burst into a frenzy of chuckling, giggling, and trance-like states of euphoria. It is worth mentioning that some of the victims who suffered prolonged effects of SCP-9108's laughter have to be administered amnestics to prevent long-lasting psychological damage.

SCP-9108 appears to be sapient and sentient, with a great sense of humor and a playful personality. It has been observed to enjoy telling stories, jokes, and doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood, even in seemingly dire situations. SCP-9108 is responsive to requests for entertainment but may retaliate if provoked or mistreated. 

SCP-9108 is currently under Foundation custody, following its apprehension in the city of ████████ after a series of unusual incidents involving uncontrollable laughter were reported by the local authorities. It is unknown how many others like SCP-9108 might exist but are yet to be discovered. Further research on SCP-9108's origins and potential uses is ongoing.
