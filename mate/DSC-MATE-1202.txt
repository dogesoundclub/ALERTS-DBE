Item #: SCP-1202

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1202 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with regular check-ins and maintenance performed by trained staff every two hours. Under no circumstances is SCP-1202 to be allowed access to open flames or firefighting equipment. 
If SCP-1202 requests a Candy Stick, it may be granted one as a reward for its cooperation, but care should be taken to monitor its sugar intake to prevent potential behavioral changes.

Description: 
SCP-1202 is a male human of average height and build with distinctive orange stripes on his face. Furthermore, SCP-1202 features a perpetually frightened-looking mouth, giving the impression of a permanent state of anxiety or apprehension. 
His head is covered in shaggy green hair that appears to grow and style itself unpredictably, which has been confirmed as a minor anomalous property. 
Above his brow line, SCP-1202 sports a red victory band that he can be seen adjusting frequently.
SCP-1202 commonly carries a Candy Stick, which it consumes from time to time.

SCP-1202 appears to be a friendly and humorous individual, often making jokes or telling amusing anecdotes to others. However, some reports suggest that SCP-1202's sense of humor is potentially inappropriate or insensitive. Any research into SCP-1202's humor and its effects should be supervised by professional psychiatrists.
 
Addendum: Knowing SCP-1202's prior occupation as a firefighter is concerning. Suitable measures must be taken to avoid any accidents caused by SCP-1202's anomalous properties. It's highly advised that all staff members avoid making any fire-related jokes or references while interacting with SCP-1202.
