Description: Subject 3915 is a human female with striking red lips and a distinct two-color band across her forehead. She is often seen wearing a green cross earring on either ear. Subject 3915 has a keen analytical and logical mind, with a proclivity towards dry and sarcastic humor.

Her wit is often used to make light of tense or high-pressure situations. It is important to note that Subject 3915 is prone to becoming emotionally detached from her work, leading to ethical quandaries. 

Background: Subject 3915 was discovered during a routine Foundation investigation into an illegal money-laundering operation. She had been employed by the bank in question for several years, being one of their top-performing employees. Upon further investigation and questioning, it became apparent that Subject 3915 was unaware of her own abilities, having never used them maliciously. She was subsequently offered employment by the Foundation and accepted, hoping to use her unique abilities for the greater good. 

Addendum: Subject 3915 has expressed an interest in exploring the anomalous world further, citing her own abilities as proof of their existence. The Ethics Committee is currently reviewing her request for limited field work.
