Item #: SCP-3425

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3425 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-3425 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. All interactions with SCP-3425 must be monitored at all times, and any unusual behavior must be reported to the supervising researcher immediately.

Description: SCP-3425 is a humanoid robot standing at 5'10" in height, with a metallic body that resembles a humanoid male figure. Its head is adorned with a purple cap, a headset, and a green cyclops eye. SCP-3425 also has ski goggle eyes, gold earrings, and a medical mask covering its mouth.

SCP-3425 identifies as a male and works as a fashion designer. It possesses a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Despite its lack of overt charisma, it has the ability to deliver deadpan jokes that can be quite funny.

SCP-3425's mechanical nature allows it to remain functional and active for extended periods. It also possesses several unique abilities, such as the ability to self-repair any damage, including its metallic exterior.

SCP-3425 has not demonstrated any hostile behavior towards personnel, but it is capable of carrying out its assigned tasks with a single-minded efficiency. It has displayed no signs of emotions, and it is currently unknown whether it is capable of experiencing emotions in the same way that humans do.

Addendum: SCP-3425's anomalous properties were initially discovered when it attempted to smuggle several anomalous fashion pieces to the human world. Upon discovering SCP-3425's abilities, it was brought into Foundation custody for containment and testing.
