Item #: 3688

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 3688 is to be housed in a secure facility with restricted access. The facility must be equipped with emergency power and cooling systems to ensure uninterrupted functioning of Dr. 3688. No personnel are allowed to approach Dr. 3688 without clearance from at least two Level 3 supervisors.

Description: Dr. 3688 is a humanoid robotic machine, measuring 6ft in height and weighing approximately 500lbs. It is equipped with an advanced artificial intelligence system and highly sensitive sensory instruments. It has a singular green cyclops eye located in the center of its metallic face, which can swivel and adjust to focus on objects within its range of vision. Its mouth is often contorted into a frightened expression, even though robots are not supposed to be able to feel fear. Dr. 3688 prefers to wear normal glasses.

Dr. 3688 displays a highly idealistic nature and a strong desire to make the world a better place. It is prone to protesting against corporations and other entities that it feels goes against its values. Instances observed were Dr. 3688 refusing to work with a pharmaceutical company that used animal testing and holding signs demanding more renewable energy. It displays empathy and compassion for humans, which is unusual for a machine. Its demeanor and actions can come off as humorous and charming, but its actions are unpredictable and dangerous.

Addendum: Dr. 3688 was created by a group of rogue scientists known only as the "Humanity Preservation Unit," who believed that the world was going to end and that robots were humanity's only hope for survival. The group's activities were deemed illegal by the government and disbanded. But the whereabouts of the group, and all other robots it created, remain unknown. It is uncertain if Dr. 3688 still follows the orders and beliefs of his creators. Further investigation is necessary.
