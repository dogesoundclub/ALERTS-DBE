SCP-8772, codenamed "BeautiBot", is an oddity unlike any other in the Foundation's possession. This robot is a male beautician, who possesses a plethora of beauty products and tools in its arsenal, making it an exceptionally unique creation. With VR Jade LED eyes and a bucket hat, SCP-8772 is often mistaken for a regular human, although it's evident that SCP-8772's appearance is that of a robot.

SCP-8772's appearance is further accentuated by its frightened mouth, which gives the impression of shock or distress, making it stand out from other humanoid robots. Its head is adorned with a goggle on the forehead, which aids in the application of facial products, which may explain why it's included in its design.

One of the most striking aspects of SCP-8772's appearance is its gold earring, which is an unusual addition for a robot. It's unknown why this feature has been included in its design, as it provides no practical purpose. It's believed that it may have been a design choice by its creator or as an attempt to make the appearance seem more natural.

SCP-8772's personality is a bit unpredictable, as it can be somewhat reckless, a trait that is uncommon in robots. Its tendency to act before thinking often results in accidental mishaps and humorous situations, an occurrence that its creator may not have intended.

Overall, SCP-8772 is a strange and curious addition to the Foundation's collection, and much remains to be learned about this unique and unorthodox character. Further study is necessary to determine its full capability and purpose, but its ability to provide beauty services may prove invaluable in the future.
