Item #: 4171

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 4171 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-17. Access to research materials should be granted upon request, as it is believed that providing 4171 with educational materials is essential in keeping them calm and cooperative.

Description: 4171 is a female human, with unique features including orange stripes on her face and jade LED eyes. She also wears a goggle on her forehead and a medical mask over her mouth. Her head is adorned with 90s brown hair, and she wears a jade earring and gold chain as accessory. 

Personality: Often lost in their own extensive research, 4171 has a deep thirst for knowledge and is constantly digging into obscure topics to expand their understanding of the world around them. They have been observed spending long hours reading and collecting books, documentaries and other educational materials. However, their intense passion and desire for sharing their newfound knowledge occasionally overshadows the need to maintain secrecy, which can put them in danger in the wrong hands.

Addendum 4171-1:  During routine testing, it was discovered that 4171 has an advanced understanding of electrical systems and appears to possess the ability to manipulate electrical currents at the molecular level. As such, 4171 is to be monitored for any signs of anomalous behavior in this regard.
