SCP-7350 is a human male who stands at a towering height of 6'5". At first glance, he appears to be a typical politician, with his perfectly tailored suit and slicked-back hair. However, upon closer inspection, several unique features are noted. His most noticeable feature is a small black spot on the corner of his mouth, which seems to move of its own accord. The subject claims it is a birthmark, but its quiet murmurs would suggest otherwise.

SCP-7350 sports a green cross earring on his right ear, which seems to be an innate part of his body, and cannot be removed by any known means. He is always seen with a silver chain around his neck, which he fidgets with constantly in times of stress.

The subject's personality is best described as determined and focused. He's a man who knows what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it. This ambition has led to him taking on more than he can handle at times, but his strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills have always pulled him through in the end.

SCP-7350 has demonstrated an uncanny ability to charm his way out of any sticky situation, making him a valuable asset in the political world. However, it's important to note that underneath this charm lies a cunning and manipulative nature, and he should never be trusted completely. 

Overall, SCP-7350 is a complex individual whose unique features and personality make him a fascinating subject of study. His motivations are still largely unknown, but one thing is certain- he's a force to be reckoned with.
