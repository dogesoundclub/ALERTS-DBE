Item #: 273

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 273, also known as “Train Driver”, is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times when not in use. The room must be kept at a constant temperature of 20°C and monitored for any unusual activity. An emergency shutdown button must be present at all times in case of unexpected behavior.

Description:
273 is a robotic train driver with one green cyclops eye as its face feature. The subject's eye is accompanied by a perpetually frightened mouth, and its eyes resemble ski goggles. Its head is covered with green hair in a purple cap, while a medical mask covers its mouth. 273 always wears a red scarf around its "neck".

Personality:
273 is a very introspective robot and appears to be lost in thought most of the time. It often daydreams, leading to accidental encounters with objects and the world around it. Its tendency to get lost in thought makes it an unreliable driver at times, but it is far from dangerous as it always prioritizes the safety of its passengers. 

Addendum:
Though 273 is an intelligent robot, it requires maintenance due to its introspective programming resulting in occasional glitches. Repair and maintenance costs related to 273 are to be covered by the company that owns the train on which he operates. Any changes to 273's programming require the approval of the DogeSoundClub.
