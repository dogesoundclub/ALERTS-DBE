Item #: 7207

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7207 is to be monitored at all times and restricted to standard human living arrangements. Item 7207 is permitted to continue their current profession as a real estate agent, but all clients are to be thoroughly screened by Foundation agents and must sign non-disclosure agreements. Item 7207 is not to be approached by non-Foundation personnel under any circumstances.

Description: Item 7207 is a male human with orange stripes on their face and a perpetually frightened mouth. Their eyes are VR Jade LED, and they wear a retro cap and jade earring. Item 7207 possesses a very creative mind and exhibits a vivid imagination, often engaging in hobbies such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, or collecting unusual objects.

Item 7207's unique appearance and personality traits pose no immediate danger to Foundation personnel or the general public. However, their imaginative abilities have been known to attract the attention of otherworldly creatures and entities, putting Item 7207 in potential danger.

Further research is ongoing to examine the extent of Item 7207's abilities and potential threats to both themselves and the Foundation. Any suspicious behavior or unexplained events related to Item 7207's work or personal life must be reported immediately to Foundation agents.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, Item 7207 reported encountering a group of mysterious figures attempting to purchase a property through them. Description of these figures appear to be consistent with Class-A non-human entities. Foundation personnel have been dispatched to track and contain these entities, and Item 7207 has been placed under additional protection until further notice.
