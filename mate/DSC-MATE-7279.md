Description: 7279 is a humanoid robot of masculine design, approximately 1.8 meters (5'11) tall. The body of 7279 is primarily metallic in composition, with various synthetic fabrics covering select areas of its body. The robot's head is adorned with a "Doge Hat" - a cultural artifact easily identified by its white woolen exterior and black rim. 7279's optical sensors are integrated into ski goggles of unidentifiable make, and contain unspecified scanning and magnifying functionalities. Protruding from either side of 7279's head are two artificial ears, one of which affixed with a red cross earring. In addition to these items, 7279 is commonly seen wearing a red scarf, although the material composition of this accessory remains unknown.

7279 is a highly detail-oriented machine. It tends to focus on minute aspects of its surroundings with an emphasis on organization - items in a space are often alphabetized, sorted by color, or arranged in a perfectly symmetrical fashion. Despite its offbeat nature, 7279 remains highly functional in its role as a reporter, often able to extract even the most concealed information with ease.

Addendum: Despite its highly analytical nature, it is crucial that personnel remain cautious when interacting with 7279. As a machine, 7279 is prone to unexpected outbursts when faced with disorganization or disorder. Such instances can result in bodily harm or destruction of property. It is recommended that personnel avoid any action that may create clutter or any form of technical malfunction when in the presence of 7279.
