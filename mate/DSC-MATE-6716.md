Item #: 6716

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6716 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to legal documentation and standard reading material. All interactions with 6716 must be conducted via remote communication to avoid possible contamination of memetic accidents. Access to legal documents must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 6716 appears as a human male in his late 30s with distinctive orange stripes across his face. The subject is always seen wearing a peculiar “Doge” hat on his head and a medical mask across his frightened mouth. His eyes are covered by normal glasses to correct vision impairment. On colder days, he wears a red scarf to keep his neck warm.

The subject works as a lawyer and exhibits a strong sense of independence. Although he is intelligent and well-educated, he often insists on doing things by himself, even when it is impractical. This stubbornness sometimes leads to humorously tense situations, like trying to carry heavy furniture without assistance or refusing to use a map even when lost.

Addendum: In recent interviews, Subject 6716 expressed concerns about severe anxiety and paranoia, which he attributes to a recent incident in his law firm. Although the legal department is currently not aware of any anomalous activity, additional inquiries regarding this case should be conducted to uncover any potential threats that may significantly affect the well-being of Subject 6716.
