Item #: SCP-2292

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2292 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced door. All personnel entering the chamber must be accompanied by at least two armed guards. SCP-2292 is allowed to have a computer with internet access for programming work, but all files and programs are to be monitored by Foundation technicians for unusual code or behavioral patterns.

SCP-2292's red scarf and jade earring are to be kept in a locked container in its chamber. Access to SCP-2292's cigarette is restricted and monitored.

Description: SCP-2292 is a male tiger of unknown origin, possessing anomalous abilities related to programming and computer systems. SCP-2292's facial features include a consistently frightened mouth, even when expressing contentment or pleasure.

SCP-2292 is able to rapidly process and write complex computer code and programs, exceeding that of even the most skilled human programmers. SCP-2292's abilities allow it to hack into secure computer systems and bypass firewalls with ease.

SCP-2292 is also known to be highly sociable and outgoing, often seeking out attention from Foundation personnel. It enjoys telling jokes and stories, often inducing uncontrollable laughter in those around it.

SCP-2292 possesses a red scarf and jade earring, which it claims are important to its personal identity. The reason for these accessories and SCP-2292's background remain unknown.

Addendum: SCP-2292's abilities have been used to facilitate Foundation espionage and infiltration operations. However, caution must be exercised when using SCP-2292 in the field, as its outgoing personality can potentially reveal its anomalous nature and the existence of the Foundation to outside parties.
