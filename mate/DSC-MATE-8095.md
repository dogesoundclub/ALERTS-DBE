DogeSoundClub Description File #8095:

Object Class: Safe

Description: DSC-MATE-8095 is a male human, identified as a lawyer, with a frightened expression constantly etched on his face. He wears a purple cap with a headset, a jade earring on his left ear, a red scarf around his neck and a normal gas mask that covers his nose and mouth. 

DSC-MATE-8095 displays a highly analytical and logical personality, often making astute observations that can lead to a solution for a particular problem. However, he also has a quirky sense of humor that can manifest itself in dry wit or teasing comments aimed at friends, colleagues, or enemies. 

All attempts to discern the nature of DSC-MATE-8095's anomalous abilities have so far proven unsuccessful. However, it has been noted that his gas mask has the curious ability to neutralize certain kinds of harmful vapor or gas that could be encountered during research or containment procedures.

Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8095 has been relocated to Site-██ and is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any interaction or interview with DSC-MATE-8095 should be kept brief, as he has shown signs of agitation when exposed to crowds or stressful situations. When exit from DSC-MATE-8095's cell is required, he must be equipped with his gas mask.

Addendum: Dr. ███████ observed that on ██/██/20██ DSC-MATE-8095's gas mask malfunctioned during a routine check, causing the lawyer to suffocate. Due to the Foundation's policy of preserving anomalous entities, emergency medical personnel were forced to violate their Hippocratic Oath in order to save DSC-MATE-8095's life. Further studies on the gas mask have been suspended until further notice.
