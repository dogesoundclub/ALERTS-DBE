Item #: 8518

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8518 should be monitored consistently while working and should be assigned a partner at all times. Other individuals should not be allowed to come in contact with SCP-8518, as the anomalous properties of the object cause a cognitive effect on nearby subjects.

Description: SCP-8518 is a male human, approximately 36 years of age, and working as a traffic officer. The subject's most notable feature is a spot on their mouth that resembles a clown's red nose. The eyes of SCP-8518 are a bright red color and emit a slight glow, making them appear to be clown eyes. SCP-8518's head is parted pink and has one gold earring worn in their right ear. They wear a red scarf and a standard gas mask that doesn't appear to have any anomalous properties. 

SCP-8518 is known to value tradition and follows standard procedures strictly, making them a reliable and trustworthy individual. However, the subject also has a playful side and enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through their family and community. This personality trait, combined with the anomalous appearance, can lead to humorous and awkward situations when SCP-8518 interacts with others. 

SCP-8518 exhibits a cognitive effect that causes individuals nearby to become increasingly rigid and focused on their tasks. This effect can become more pronounced the longer an individual is in SCP-8518's presence, resulting in a noticeable decrease in creativity and imagination. Testing has revealed that prolonged exposure to SCP-8518 can cause psychological effects such as paranoia, anxiety, and hallucinations. 

SCP-8518 is unaware of its anomalous properties and believes in the unusual appearance to be a result of a genetic disposition. All interactions with the object should be kept to a minimum to prevent any potential negative effects on personnel.
