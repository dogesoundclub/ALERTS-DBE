Description: DSC-MATE-5742 is a humanoid female identified as a real estate agent, with the appearance of blonde hair worn in a Ushanka, wearing green cross earrings, choker, and carrying a cigarette. The most notable feature of DSC-MATE-5742 is a series of orange stripes across her face, which is the origin of her nickname "Tabby."

DSC-MATE-5742 has demonstrated a personality trait of strong independence, often resistant to following strict protocols or perceived arbitrary rules. DSC-MATE-5742 has been observed as a rebellious agent, often seen sneaking out of the office early or taking unauthorized leave.
