SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: 5059

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5059 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to a small outdoor enclosure for exercise. The chamber is to be reinforced with a layer of steel mesh to prevent escape. Item 5059's diet is to consist of fresh vegetables and fruits, with a small amount of protein. Personnel are not to approach item 5059 without proper protective gear due to its unpredictable behavior.

Description: Item 5059 is a male rabbit of indeterminate breed, standing at roughly 1 meter in height on its hind legs. Its fur is a mottled brown and black, with a distinctive blue bandana tied around its head. Item 5059 is always in a state of fear, with a constantly agape mouth and wide eyes. It displays a notable aversion to loud noises and sudden movements.

Item 5059 displays a unique ability to mimic sounds, including human speech. It often uses this ability to garner attention and to make others laugh. It has been observed to tell humorous stories and perform silly antics for entertainment. Its sense of humor, however, can often come across as inappropriate or crass, making it difficult to control in social situations.

Along with the blue bandana, item 5059 also wears a pair of goggles on its forehead, a gold chain around its neck, and carries a whistle in its mouth. The purpose of these items is unknown.

Addendum: Item 5059 has demonstrated an unusual talent for pickpocketing and thievery, leading to the loss of several items from Foundation personnel. It is recommended that all items of value be secured when in the presence of item 5059.
