SCP-2590 wears a jade earring on her right ear and a choker around her neck. She is also frequently seen wearing a standard gas mask, which she claims she needs to protect herself from pollutants.

SCP-2590 displays a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. She has been observed telling funny stories and doing impersonations to lighten the mood in the containment chamber. However, she can become easily agitated and has a tendency to lash out if provoked.

SCP-2590's occupation as a farmer has led her to display a deep knowledge of agriculture, plant genetics, and various farming techniques. She has expressed a desire to continue her work in agriculture if given the opportunity.

Addendum 2590-A: Foundation personnel are advised not to engage SCP-2590 in prolonged conversations, as she has been known to use her humor as a means of distracting and manipulating others.
