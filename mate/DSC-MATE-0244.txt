Item #: SCP-244

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-244 is currently employed as a reporter for a local news outlet. Foundation agents have been installed within the news agency to monitor SCP-244's reports for any mention of anomalous activity. Any such references are to be redacted prior to publication.

SCP-244 is to be allowed unrestricted access to Foundation-owned media archives, as requested, to aid in their research.

Description: SCP-244 is a male human, estimated to be in his mid-thirties, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. The subject's most notable features include a prominent spot on the lower lip and ski goggle-shaped eyes, which are a result of anomalous genetic mutations.

SCP-244 often wears a retro cap on its head and a medical mask over the mouth. The mask serves both to protect from airborne pathogens and to conceal SCP-244's unique features. The subject also frequently wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-244 exhibits a laid-back and easy-going personality. However, the subject becomes fiercely protective of their loved ones, often leading to humorous situations such as heated arguments with individuals who insult friends or family members.

SCP-244 has displayed no overt anomalous abilities or traits. However, the subject's unique mutations have piqued Foundation interest in terms of potential future research.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-244 submitted a request to interview containment specialist Dr. ███████. Upon review and approval by O5 Command, the interview was conducted under strict supervision. See supplemental file SCP-244-Interview-01 for a transcript of the interview.
