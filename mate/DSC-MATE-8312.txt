SCP-8312, also known as "The Red Clown," is a humanoid entity that appears as a female car salesman. They possess striking red clown eyes and flaunts a bold red lip. Their head is unkempt and colored a sickly green, while their ears are adorned with intimidating red cross earrings.

SCP-8312 is often seen wearing an intricate silver chain and holding a cigarette. Despite their unusual appearance, they have been known to charm potential customers with their laid-back and easy-going demeanor. However, those who cross them or insult their loved ones will quickly feel the full force of their fiercely loyal and protective personality.

Despite their seemingly comical appearance, SCP-8312 is not to be taken lightly. They have been observed engaging in heated arguments and physical altercations with those who insult or harm their friends and family. SCP-8312's loyalty is not limited to just human relationships either; they have been known to form strong bonds with inanimate objects, particularly cars.

Approach with caution and do not underestimate SCP-8312's tenacity and protective nature. Any attempts at containment should take into account their strong connections and bonds to the people and objects they hold dear.
