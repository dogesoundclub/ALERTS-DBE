Item #: 1843

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 1843 is to be kept in a secure locker at all times when not in use. Access to 1843 requires Level 2 clearance and must be authorized by at least two Foundation personnel. Regular maintenance checks are to be conducted every three months to ensure proper functioning.

Description: 1843 is a humanoid robot identified as a male police officer. It stands at 6’2” and weighs approximately 220 pounds. 1843’s most notable feature is its single green cyclops eye, which glows brightly in low light conditions. Its mouth is in a permanent expression of fear, giving a comical appearance. 1843 can often be seen wearing nerd glasses and goggles on its forehead. It also has a gold earring on its left ear.

1843 is a very energetic and enthusiastic being that enjoys getting others excited about things, often leading to humorous situations. It is equipped with a silver chain and whistle, and it’s uncertain if they are part of its default programming, or if they have been added by previous handlers.

1843 has been programmed with a wide range of law enforcement tactics, and its programming can be updated with new information as required. However, it has shown a strong interest in detective work, and its enthusiasm for the job sometimes causes it to overlook important details.

Addendum: Due to 1843’s comical appearance, it is often used as a morale booster for Foundation personnel, offering a distraction from the more serious work they undertake. However, caution should be taken to ensure its programming remains in line with the goals of the Foundation, and any potential security risk is addressed.
