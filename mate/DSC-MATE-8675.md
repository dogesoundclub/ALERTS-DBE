Subject 8675 may appear relatively normal, but her personality holds some peculiarities. She is highly reliable and organized in her work, but her stubbornness proves challenging to deal with. She adheres strongly to her routines and struggles with new ideas or unexpected changes that challenge her. This could result in potentially harmful effects if not managed appropriately.

Addendum: Subject 8675 has not shown any overtly anomalous signs, but her adherence to routines and resistance to change warrant further investigation. The Foundation is to continue monitoring Subject 8675 and her designs to prevent any potential anomalous effects from reaching the public.
