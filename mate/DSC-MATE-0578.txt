Item #: 578 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 578 is to be kept under strict surveillance at all times. Access to the subject is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. Any unauthorized interaction with the subject will result in immediate termination. 

Description: Subject 578 appears as a female human, with striking red clown eyes and witch short hair. Their lips are painted red, and they wear a two-color band across their forehead as well as golden earrings. Subject 578 is often seen smoking a cigarette. 

Personality: Subject 578 displays an unusually high level of empathy and compassion, which can at times attract attention from individuals or entities that require such qualities. While this may seem admirable, this tendency can also lead to them taking on other people's problems and becoming emotionally exhausted. 

The subject, although human, is known to possess anomalous properties to a degree that is not fully understood. It is recommended that all staff employed at the facility avoid direct eye contact with the subject and not engage them in conversation or make physical contact in any way. 

Due to the unpredictable nature of the subject, any changes in behavior or noticeable power surges should be reported immediately to the containment team. Failure to do so may result in grave consequences.
