SCP-847, codenamed "Hopscotch," is a unique anomaly in our world of urban fantasy. This police officer appears to be a rabbit, with characteristic long ears and fluffy tail. His frightened mouth and blue clown eyes leave a lasting impression on all who interact with him. Do not let his cute appearance fool you: 847 is a formidable member of law enforcement.

Despite his small size, this creature is bold and courageous. He possesses a strong sense of justice and is determined to uphold the law at all costs. However, his impulsive nature often gets the better of him. SCP-847 is known to act on his emotions before thinking things through. This can lead to amusing situations, such as making spontaneous decisions that others find surprising or humorous. 

In addition to his uniform, SCP-847 is never seen without his silver chain. Its purpose and significance remain unknown. The Foundation has not been able to locate any information about SCP-847's origins or how he acquired his abilities. It is clear, however, that he is not an ordinary rabbit. He is intelligent and capable, and his presence on the force is welcome.

SCP-847, Hopscotch, may be different from other officers in appearance, but he deserves our respect and admiration for his dedication and bravery in the face of danger.
