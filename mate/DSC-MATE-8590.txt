Item #: SCP-8590

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8590 is to be contained in a high-security facility at all times. No staff or personnel are allowed to have any direct contact with SCP-8590, and all communications must be conducted via an audiovisual interface from a safe distance.

SCP-8590 must be kept sedated at all times, with a combination of tranquilizing agents and antipsychotic medication, to prevent any sudden outbursts or violent tendencies. Any attempts by SCP-8590 to communicate through telepathic or psychic means must be monitored closely and reported to senior personnel immediately.

In the event of a containment breach, all staff and personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and follow established emergency protocols.

Description: SCP-8590 is a human male of indeterminate age, approximately 6'3" (192cm) tall, with an athletic build and an imposing physical presence. His face is characterized by a constant, almost unnerving smile, and his eyes are bright red with an unusual clown-like appearance.

SCP-8590 sports a distinctive combination of green hair with a purple cap, a two-color band across his forehead, and a single gold earring hanging from his left ear. He is frequently seen with a candy stick held between his teeth.

SCP-8590 possesses heightened psychic abilities, including the ability to predict events before they happen and to sense the emotions of those around him. He has displayed a remarkable aptitude for reading body language and vocal intonation, making him an adept manipulator and master of interpersonal dynamics.

SCP-8590 is known to have ties to organized crime syndicates and is believed to have held various high-ranking positions within these groups. He is considered extremely dangerous and unpredictable, with a tendency towards sadism and violence.

Addendum: SCP-8590 was apprehended by Foundation agents during a joint operation with local law enforcement agencies. He was identified as the leader of a major Mafia syndicate, responsible for multiple high-profile crimes and acts of violence across multiple jurisdictions.

Attempts to interrogate SCP-8590 proved fruitless due to his psychic abilities and resistance to conventional interrogation techniques. He was subsequently classified as an SCP object and transferred to Foundation custody for containment and study.
