Subject 2140 is a peculiar specimen of humanity. With vibrant orange stripes on her face and a red lip that seems permanently fixed in a sly smirk, she catches the eye of anyone who dares to look twice. But it's her blue clown eyes that truly make her stand out. Staring straight into them, one can't help but feel unnerved by the glint of something not quite human lurking within. 

The subject's head is topped with flowing blonde hair, and upon closer inspection, one can spot a small wing poking out from her locks. Her ears are adorned with a green cross earring, a symbol of some unknown significance to her. 

Though a real estate agent by profession, Subject 2140's personality hints at a complex and stubborn individual. She operates with a precise reliability, but struggles to adjust to change or accept alternative ideas. This can lead to amusing situations as she obstinately clings to her routines, even in the face of the unexpected. 

Further observation and testing are necessary to determine the full extent of Subject 2140's abilities and potential concerns for containment.
