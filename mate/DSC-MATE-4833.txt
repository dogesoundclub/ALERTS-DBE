**Personality:** SCP-4833 is highly observant and attentive to details, which allows it to excel in its role as a security guard. However, these traits can also make it overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift, and it will often spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone. SCP-4833’s gift-giving skills are notable and well appreciated among fellow Site personnel.

**Additional Notes:** SCP-4833 was recruited as a security guard due to its exceptional abilities in detection and rapid response to unauthorized access. It is known to have good team communication skills and a strong sense of responsibility towards its duties. SCP-4833 has been observed to have a penchant for smoking cigars, a habit which has been allowed due to the lack of evidence regarding its impact on SCP-4833’s behavior or health. Any incidents linked to its smoking habit are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.
