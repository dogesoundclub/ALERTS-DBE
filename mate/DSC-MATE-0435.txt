Item #: SCP-435

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-435 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. Access is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-435 must be done in a controlled and monitored environment.

Description: SCP-435 appears to be a male tiger, with a frightened expression on its mouth. Its eyes are hidden behind a pair of normal glasses, and its head is not arranged in its natural fur color, instead being colored green. Extended observations have shown that the green color is not due to any dye or pigment.

Several features on the SCP-435's face are noteworthy. It wears a pair of goggles on its forehead, and a two-color band is visible on its forehead. A red cross earring is also noticed on its ears. SCP-435 also wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-435 is capable of speaking in human language, which it uses to communicate with personnel. Its personality is described as laid-back and easy-going, but it is fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. It has shown humorous tendencies, such as engaging in heated arguments with anyone who insults a friend or family member.

SCP-435's job is listed as a police officer, although it is unclear how it obtained this profession. SCP-435's origins and other details about its species are unknown.

Addendum: Incident Report 435-01

On █/██/20██, SCP-435 became agitated and attempted to break out of its containment chamber. It demanded to see its "partner," whom it claimed was in danger. Under the pretext of checking the SCP-435's chamber, personnel checked on this "partner," who was revealed to be a stuffed tiger toy. SCP-435 calmed down after the toy was returned to its chamber, leading researchers to believe that SCP-435 has a belief that the toy is alive and requires protection. Further research is ongoing.
