Item #: DSC-MATE-9655

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9655 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. It is to be provided with a designated area for mechanical work, and access to tools and equipment upon request. Any requests for materials or supplies must be approved by at least one Level 2 personnel. DSC-MATE-9655 has been issued a standard Foundation uniform and is to wear it at all times when outside of its containment cell.

DSC-MATE-9655 does not require any specific diet or medical care beyond standard humanoid care. However, due to its species and potential for aggression, all interactions with DSC-MATE-9655 must be conducted with caution and under close supervision.

In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to secure themselves in a safe location and to contact security for immediate assistance. DSC-MATE-9655 is to be contained at all costs.

Description: DSC-MATE-9655 is a male tiger with green hair and a purple cap. It has VR Jade LED eyes and a frightened mouth expression. A goggle is worn on its forehead, and a red cross earring in one of its ears. DSC-MATE-9655 is often observed wearing a gold chain as an accessory.

Despite its appearance, DSC-MATE-9655 possesses expert mechanical skills and has worked as a mechanic in the past. Its observant and detail-oriented nature makes it an excellent gift-giver, although it may become overly concerned with providing the "perfect" gift and spend excessive amounts of time on gift selection.

DSC-MATE-9655 has demonstrated occasional abnormal behavior, such as sudden mood shifts and bouts of aggression. Because of this, all interactions with DSC-MATE-9655 must be conducted carefully and with caution.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-9655 exhibited an anomalous ability to manipulate mechanical objects with its mind. Testing revealed that DSC-MATE-9655 was capable of controlling and manipulating machinery, including unlocking and manipulating electronic doors, and repairing damaged mechanical objects without the use of tools. This ability appears to be conscious and within DSC-MATE-9655's control. Further research is necessary to understand the extent of this ability and how it came to be.
