Description: 6980 is a human female, appearing to be in her mid-thirties, with striking red lips and a headset adorned with LED lighting. A two-color band is also present on her forehead, serving as an additional identifying feature.

Of particular note are the accessories worn by 6980, which include a gold chain around her neck and a cigarette frequently clutched between her fingers. 6980 is employed as a banker, using her natural ingenuity and penchant for creative brainstorming to develop new financial solutions.

While appearing to be affable and outgoing, 6980's sense of humor is often irreverent and subversive, seemingly delighting in coming up with outlandish schemes just to gauge the reactions of others. 

Additional notes indicate that 6980 should be approached with caution, as her natural aptitude for problem-solving may lead to the development of unorthodox solutions that could have unexpected consequences. Extreme vigilance is recommended when interacting with 6980, as her true motivations are as yet unclear.
