Item #: 3934

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their position as a train driver, 3934 is currently in containment within their work environment. They are under constant surveillance and must adhere to a strict schedule to prevent any unauthorized excursions. 3934 must also wear specialized gear to prevent any accidental activation of their anomalous properties. Contact with any individuals outside of their designated duties is strictly prohibited.

Description: 3934 is a male monkey of indeterminate species with a distinctive mohawk on their head. Their forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles, which have not been observed to hinder their vision. 3934 also wears a gold chain as an accessory which serves no apparent purpose.

3934 is known for their charismatic personality and ability to connect with others on a deep level. They possess an ability to make those around them more comfortable and open, often leading to humorous situations where strangers divulge their life stories or funny anecdotes are shared.

It has been observed that 3934 possesses an anomalous ability which causes individuals who come into close proximity with them to become more receptive to suggestion. This effect is heightened when 3934 is interacting with individuals directly, and is diminished when 3934 is not actively engaging with others.

Anyone who comes into contact with 3934 should be kept under close observation to prevent any unintended consequences.

Addendum: Due to their unique ability to connect with others, there is potential for 3934 to be valuable in a covert intelligence gathering capacity. Further testing is required.
