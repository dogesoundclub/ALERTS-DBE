Item #: 3271

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3271 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Daily psychological evaluations and physical examinations are mandatory.

Description: Subject 3271 appears to be a human male in his late thirties. His most notable feature is his perpetual grin and his bright red clown eyes, which are most likely due to an anomalous mutation. He wears a doge hat, a red scarf, and often can be found smoking a cigarette. Subject 3271's natural charm and charisma make him a master of salesmanship and socializing, but also make him difficult to contain. He thrives in social situations and can easily manipulate those around him, making him a potential threat to the public.

Personality: Subject 3271 possesses a jovial and playful personality. He is often seen cracking jokes, making balloon animals, or performing silly dances to entertain others. However, his sense of humor is twisted and often contains dark elements that may be construed as sadistic or cruel. Subject 3271 exhibits a love for fast cars and frequently mentions them in conversation. Despite his playful demeanor, he possesses a degree of cunning and manipulation, and it is recommended to approach him with caution.

Addendum 3271-1: Subject 3271 was initially captured following reports of his ability to sell vehicles under dubious circumstances. Upon capture, he was found to be in possession of several anomalous items and weapons. He claims that these were only for self-defense, but baseless as his claims might be, we are monitoring his containment more closely.
