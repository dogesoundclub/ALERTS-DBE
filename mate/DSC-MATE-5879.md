Subject 5879, known to the public as a simple banker, is a peculiar individual. Donning the guise of a police officer, their head is adorned with a rugged, navy blue cap. Their ears are pierced with a glimmering gold earring that seems to bear a strange emblem. Upon their face lies an array of spots, as if they were splattered with ink. However, this is not the most unnerving feature on their face. No, that would be their eyes. Crimson orbs that hold the uncanny resemblance to the eyes of a circus clown. 

But that is not all. Subject 5879 also wears an LED gas mask that emits neon green light in darker rooms. Their personality is equally strange as their appearance. They possess a dry sense of humor that can leave others dumbfounded. They appear impervious to social norms, and their deadpan humor adds an extra eerie layer to their demeanor. While they may not be the happiest individual at a party, they have a way of stealing the spotlight with their unconventional jokes.

Caution is advised when approaching Subject 5879, for their quirky nature may mask a darker inner-self. Observed to be highly intelligent, they may hold secrets that are best left undiscovered. Please report any further findings of Subject 5879 to the Foundation.
