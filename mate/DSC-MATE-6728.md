Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6728 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel, who are to keep a close watch on his activities and movements.

Description: DSC-MATE-6728 is a male human who is a professional journalist and reporter. His most notable features are his orange stripes on his face, a smile that is often seen, and a medical mask that he wears over his mouth as protection. He also has a goggle on his forehead and a green cross earring on his left ear, as well as a gold chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-6728 displays a highly organized and efficient personality, which at times can be interpreted as controlling. He has a tendency to take charge of projects or events and delegate tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. Despite this, he often finds himself in humorous situations due to his insistence on perfection and his strive for control.

Interview logs with DSC-MATE-6728 reveal that he is aware of the existence of the supernatural and has investigated rumors and stories related to such occurrences. However, DSC-MATE-6728's drive to uncover such phenomena may lead to his targeting or putting himself in harm's way, which the Foundation aims to prevent.

Due to DSC-MATE-6728's knowledge of supernatural events and his tendency to investigate them, it has been proposed that he be designated as a member of the Foundation's external network of contacts. This proposal is pending approval from the O5 Council.
