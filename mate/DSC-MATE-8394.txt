Description: SCP-8394, also known as "The Mechanic," is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on his face. His eyes resemble ski goggles and he has a normal blond hairstyle. SCP-8394 is often seen wearing a medical mask and a pair of goggles on his forehead. 

SCP-8394 has demonstrated a highly analytical and logical personality. Its thought processes are highly structured, and its problem-solving skills are notably focused and precise. However, SCP-8394 has also displayed a quirky sense of humor, often lacing its observations with dry wit and sarcasm. 

SCP-8394 is highly skilled in mechanical and engineering skills, often producing highly functional devices with minimal instruction. SCP-8394 has also demonstrated a high degree of proficiency in repairing and maintaining mechanical equipment to a high standard.

SCP-8394's silver chain and jade earring serve as its primary emotional support, and it is highly attached to them. Any attempts to remove them have resulted in highly emotional outbursts from SCP-8394. 

SCP-8394 was discovered after an incident involving the accidental construction of a highly advanced device that was capable of disabling electronic equipment within a large radius. SCP-8394 was located and detained without incident, and it has been kept in SCP Foundation custody since then.

Addendum: SCP-8394 has displayed strong resistance to memetic hazards, test logs have shown SCP-8394 being immune to any visual or auditory memetic agents that it has encountered. Research is currently ongoing into the causes of this immunity.
