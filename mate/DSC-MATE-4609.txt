Item #: 4609

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Theater Manager

Species: Human

Gender: Male

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4609 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site ██. Personnel must avoid causing emotional distress to the subject, as it may trigger anomalous effects.

Description: Subject 4609 appears to be a middle-aged male with spots on his skin. The subject wears nerd glasses and has not arranged green hair on his head. Despite appearing human, 4609 exhibits anomalous traits in response to emotionally charged stimuli. The subject exhibits strong emotions, frequently expressing heightened feelings of sentimentality towards movies, TV shows, music or art that evoke an emotional response. These responses can range from extreme joy to profound sadness or melancholia. Such triggers appear to cause the subject's anomalous effects.

When moved to tears or intense emotional states, 4609 can manifest an aura of unknown, but highly potent psychic energy. When the subject's emotional state escalates beyond a certain threshold, the resulting energy can cause unpredictable and dangerous events to occur. These effects can include, but are not limited to, the manifestation of strange phenomena such as spontaneous reality distortions, anomalous weather conditions, and other changes to the environment which may cause injury or harm to the subject and those around him.

Personality: Subject 4609 is generally friendly and approachable, though prone to mood swings based on their emotional state. Personnel must be careful when interacting with the subject and avoid any actions that may trigger harmful emotional responses. The subject is fond of movies, TV shows, music, and art that evokes strong feelings, often becoming lost in their emotions.

Due to the potential danger posed by the subject's anomalous effects, Site ██ has placed restrictions on the types of media and entertainment available to 4609. The aim of these restrictions is to minimize the potential risks associated with their emotional responses.

Subject 4609 has been employed as a theater manager, where the subject's love for the performing arts can be harnessed without exposing the general population to the risks associated with their emotional responses.

Addendum: Following Incident ███, all personnel must adhere to the special containment procedures and the restrictions regarding the material available to subject 4609. Any breach of these procedures may lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
