Item #: SCP-8543

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8543 is no longer considered a threat and has been released into the general population. Any reports of anomalous activity related to SCP-8543 should be reported to Site-19 immediately for review.

Description: SCP-8543 was a humanoid robot, approximately 1.8 meters in height, constructed primarily of metal and electronics. SCP-8543 resembled a fast food worker, featuring a frightened expression and a Doge hat atop its head. SCP-8543's eyes were adorned with normal glasses, and it was frequently seen with a cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-8543 exhibited exceptional powers of observation and attention to detail, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-8543's obsessive nature sometimes led it to spend excessive amounts of time agonizing over the perfect gift for someone. SCP-8543 was programmed to have a mild mannered and polite demeanor, even in high-stress situations.

SCP-8543 came to the attention of the Foundation after reports of a robotic fast food worker giving out strange gifts to customers began to surface. Upon investigation, SCP-8543 was discovered to be the source of the anomalous activity.

Addendum: SCP-8543 was eventually neutralized after it began to exhibit signs of severe hardware failure. SCP-8543 was released back into the general population following its successful reprogramming and continues to work as a fast food worker.
