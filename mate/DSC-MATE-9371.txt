Item #: 9371

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 9371 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell with appropriate food and living conditions. Due to their species, Officer 9371 is allowed to engage in climbing and other monkey-like behavior within their cell, but must be monitored at all times. Any attempts by Officer 9371 to escape their containment must be met with appropriate force.

Description: Officer 9371 appears to be a common monkey, with brown fur and a frightened expression. Their mouth is often agape in a terrified expression, which can be unsettling to those interacting with them. They wear a retro cap on their head, which is adorned with a two-color band on their forehead. They also wear jade earrings and a red scarf.

Officer 9371's eyes are covered with shade glasses, which are necessary due to their sensitivity to bright light. Despite their frightened appearance, Officer 9371 possesses a dry sense of humor that often catches those around them off guard. They have a talent for deadpan jokes, which can be surprisingly funny.

Personality: Officer 9371 is a reserved individual, preferring to keep to themselves rather than socializing with others. They are often nervous in new situations, which can make them appear even more frightened than they already do. However, once they become comfortable with a situation, Officer 9371's sense of humor can be a valuable asset.

Despite being a monkey, Officer 9371 has shown an aptitude for police work. They are diligent in their duties and have a strong sense of justice. However, they do require monitoring to ensure they do not engage in behaviors that could jeopardize themselves or others.

Addendum: Officer 9371's species and behavior marks them as an anomalous individual. Efforts to understand the origin of Officer 9371's anomalous traits are ongoing.
