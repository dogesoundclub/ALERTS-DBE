SCP-5386, known by her colleagues as "Emotion Engine," is a human female of average height and build. SCP-5386's most striking feature is her purple lipstick which contrasts with her golden blonde hair that appears to have a pair of wings extending from the back of her head. SCP-5386's blue clown eyes, framed by her jade earrings, are often obscured by a medical mask as part of her standard personal protective equipment.

SCP-5386's emotional sensitivity, while potentially problematic in a high-pressure situation such as operating a train, may be an asset in interpersonal communication or negotiation situations. However, due to the potential for information breaches and for preservation of SCP-5386's mental well-being, SCP-5386's training and on-job performance are closely monitored.

SCP-5386 is also observed to wear a gold chain which appears to hold sentimental value to her. Further investigation into the significance of the chain is ongoing.

Overall, SCP-5386 presents as an atypical train driver, but her unique features and emotive tendencies may provide insight into potential psychological anomalies. Further testing is recommended.
