Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4480 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with necessary amenities for rabbit physiology. Access to any electronic devices within the containment chamber is strictly prohibited. SCP-4480 is to be fed a diet consisting of fresh vegetables and fruits, in addition to a regular supply of hay and water.

Description: SCP-4480 appears as a male rabbit, standing at approximately 0.6 meters in height. Its fur is a shade of green, appearing disheveled and unbrushed. The eyes of SCP-4480 are obscured by horned rim glasses, while a single golden earring is visible on the left ear.

SCP-4480 exhibits a forgetful and absent-minded personality, often losing track of important events and appointments. It is speculated that this may be attributed to SCP-4480 becoming lost within its own thoughts, which could potentially be related to its former profession as a firefighter. SCP-4480 retains memories of its previous life and experiences, but such memories may not always be accurate or complete.

SCP-4480 has been observed to display an anomalous effect, which causes electronic devices within its proximity to malfunction. This effect has been seen to range from mild interference to catastrophic system failure. No discernible pattern or trigger for this effect has been identified as of yet.

SCP-4480 was discovered in a residential area, after an incident in which a fire had broken out within a local house. Upon intervention of nearby firefighters, SCP-4480 was discovered to have been helping within the firefighting efforts, before disappearing without a trace. Further investigation led to the discovery of SCP-4480 having been present at other firefighting incidents, under the guise of assisting with the rescue efforts. SCP-4480 was therefore deemed a potential security threat and was subsequently contained by Foundation operatives.

Addendum: SCP-4480 has displayed significant physical and cognitive abilities during testing. This includes heightened agility, reflexes, and a proficiency in firefighting techniques. Further research is required to fully understand the extent of SCP-4480's abilities.
