Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7088 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to her profession as a police officer, DSC-MATE-7088 is permitted to carry her standard-issue firearm and is authorized to leave containment. However, all her movements are to be documented.

Description: DSC-MATE-7088 is a female humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. Despite many unique physical features, DSC-MATE-7088's anomalous capabilities are limited to her appearance.

Her face has a number of lesions, sometimes referred to as spots, and red lipstick which are not unique paranatural attributes. However, DSC-MATE-7088's eyes contain a custom-designed LED rainbow color, causing them to appear computer-generated, rather than natural.

DSC-MATE-7088 wears a medical mask, though no pathological or physiological reason exists for her to wear one. Also, DSC-MATE-7088 wears a red cross earring, a silver chain, and a tiara. The reason behind this is unclear, but research shows no effect on her abilities or persona.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-7088 is an empathetic and compassionate individual, which is amplified by her profession. DSC-MATE-7088 is willing to help individuals and is willing to intervene when someone needs saving. However, DSC-MATE-7088 has shown to become exhausted when people start unloading their personal problems on her, leading her to feel responsible for everything around her.

DSC-MATE-7088 has shown no other anomalous characteristics, and her abilities are limited to her appearance, so she does not present any significant threat to the Foundation.

Addendum 7088-A: DSC-MATE-7088 was recruited into the Foundation under the guise of the global peace force. As an officer of the law and a conscientious individual, DSC-MATE-7088 is a valuable asset to the Foundation. DSC-MATE-7088 is willing to go to great lengths to save people in danger regardless of the cost to herself.
