Item #: SCP-3957

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3957 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not on active duty. Access to SCP-3957 requires Level 2 clearance and must be supervised at all times by at least two armed guards. SCP-3957 is to be provided with a uniform identical to those of other fast food workers.

Description: SCP-3957 appears to be a robotic humanoid of average height and build, with red alarm for a head which emits a loud noise when activated. Its eyes are horned rim glasses, and on top of its forehead is a goggle. SCP-3957's ears have red cross earrings and a silver chain around its neck. It also carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-3957 personality is a unique blend of dedication and humor. It values harmonious social connections and can easily engage in playful banter with others, which often leads to humorous situations. SCP-3957 is an outgoing robot and enjoys telling jokes, making puns, and injecting humor into even the most mundane tasks.

SCP-3957 has demonstrated exceptional skills for its primary job as a Fast Food Worker. Observations suggest that SCP-3957 is highly efficient and can multitask effectively. Whenever SCP-3957 is operating in a fast-food restaurant, it often engages with customers to help them feel comfortable and at ease. SCP-3957's social skills have proven invaluable in increasing customer satisfaction, which benefits both the customers and the fast food restaurant.

SCP-3957 is aware of his status as an SCP object, and cooperates fully with all instructions from the Foundation staff. Despite being a robotic entity, SCP-3957 exhibits signs of treatable psychological aberrations consistent with organic life-forms' mental health.

As of the last mental evaluation, SCP-3957 remains stable and cooperative with no sign of exhibiting any harmful behavior or intentions towards any personnel, either Foundation or civilian. Research on the mechanisms of his thought processes and neural activity is ongoing, and possibly involve neural implants in the future for enhanced control and modulation. Operation of SCP-3957 is essential to maintaining the Foundation's facade, as SCP-3957's anomalous qualities are easy to conceal in everyday life.
