Item #: SCP-1709

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1709 is to be contained within a reinforced steel cage. Any interactions with SCP-1709 should be performed remotely through video and audio feed. The cage must be checked for damages or tampering on a daily basis. Under no circumstances should any personnel be left alone with SCP-1709.

Description: SCP-1709 is a sentient tiger with a red beanie on its head and VR jade LED eyes. SCP-1709 possesses a candy stick, which it is often seen gnawing on. It has a distinctive feature of a constantly frightened mouth. This may be related to its history of being a villain, where it was constantly on the run.

Personality: Despite its reputation as a villain, SCP-1709 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. It has been observed performing selfless acts, such as protecting smaller animals from predators. SCP-1709 also knows how to have fun, often being the life of the party and getting everyone to dance or sing along to their favorite songs. It is unclear whether this behavior is an attempt to put others at ease or a genuine love of entertainment.

SCP-1709 has not displayed any anomalous abilities beyond sentience and vocal communication. Its physical abilities appear to be those of a regular tiger. Its origins and the circumstances of its transformation into a sentient being remain unknown.

Addendum: SCP-1709 has been known to display signs of aggression when its freedom is threatened. Any attempts to remove SCP-1709 from its containment or to harm it will result in immediate termination of the offending personnel. All personnel assigned to SCP-1709 must follow protocol and exercise extreme caution.
