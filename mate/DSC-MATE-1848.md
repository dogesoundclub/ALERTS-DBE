Description: DSC-MATE-1848 is a male Bengal tiger standing approximately 2.5 meters long and weighing 200 kg. DSC-MATE-1848 has been observed wearing a blue bandana around its head and a red cross earring in its ear. DSC-MATE-1848 will also wear a medical mask over its mouth when interacting with humans.

DSC-MATE-1848 exhibits an unusual level of intelligence and observation, beyond what is typical for tigers. It demonstrates a keen attention to detail and may spend significant amounts of time and effort selecting gifts for others. This behavior can become obsessive, with DSC-MATE-1848 becoming fixated on finding the "perfect" gift.

DSC-MATE-1848 is capable of understanding and responding to human speech, although it communicates primarily through body language and vocalizations. DSC-MATE-1848 has displayed a friendly and cooperative demeanor when interacting with Foundation personnel, but caution should be exercised due to its natural predatory instincts.
