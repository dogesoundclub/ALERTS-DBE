Item #: 5601

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5601 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber reinforced with high-strength steel bars to prevent escape attempts. As a monkey, 5601 is capable of feats of acrobatics and should be monitored for any potential escape attempts. The chamber should be furnished with standard medical equipment, since 5601 serves as the facility's resident doctor.

Description: 5601 is a male monkey standing at approximately 2 feet tall. Its eyes are of an unknown color, as the subject is never seen without its trademark hoodie and gas mask, which it uses to conceal its face. 5601 is always seen wearing a silver chain around its neck, which is believed to have some sentimental value. The object class of 5601 was designated as Safe due to its non-aggressive nature towards its captors.

Personality: Subject 5601 presents a unique challenge to its captors, as it has displayed a strong sense of empathy and is attuned to the emotions of others. Despite being unable to speak, 5601 has demonstrated an uncanny ability to communicate with other personnel on a level that extends beyond simple body language. This affable nature has endeared 5601 to many of the other subjects in our facility, who find comfort in its presence.

Research into the origins and abilities of 5601 is currently ongoing. Given its unique traits and abilities, it is conceivable that 5601 may pose a valuable contribution to the advancement of our research in the field of human-animal communication.

Addendum: In light of a recent incident, all personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with 5601. Due to a recent outbreak of a highly contagious virus, 5601 has been put in quarantine until further notice to prevent the spread of infection. All necessary measures have been taken to ensure that 5601 remains comfortable and healthy while under medical observation.
