Subject 3296, codenamed "The Medic," is a female human and the leader of a notorious mafia organization. Identified by her distinctive appearance, which includes a purple cap with a headset, red cross earrings, and a medical mask, she stands out as an enigmatic figure in any crowd.

The most striking feature of The Medic's face is her purple lip, which is rumored to be the result of a botched medical procedure. Some say that she deliberately chose the purple color to match her cap, while others speculate that it is a sign of her status within the criminal underworld.

Despite her intimidating appearance, The Medic is known to have a strong sense of independence and a stubborn streak that can lead to some comedic situations. She is often seen trying to move heavy objects by herself or refusing to use a map when she gets lost, preferring to rely on her own instincts.

As a mafia boss, The Medic commands respect and loyalty from her subordinates, who view her as a reliable and effective leader. However, her past as a medical professional has also given her a reputation for being ruthless and calculated in her methods, using her knowledge of anatomy and medicine to devastating effect.

Those who cross The Medic do so at their peril, for she is not one to forgive or forget a grievance. The only way to stay on her good side is to prove one's worth through loyalty and dedication, and those who do so will find themselves in the favor of one of the most powerful figures in the city's criminal underworld.
