Designation: SCP-6073

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6073 is to be contained in a standard human-sized cell with no less than four security cameras monitoring the cell at all times. Any interaction with SCP-6073 must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel, and no physical contact is allowed.

Description: SCP-6073 is a male tiger of a previously undiscovered species. The subject is 1.8 meters long from nose to tail and weighs approximately 130 kilograms. SCP-6073 primarily resembles a Bengal tiger, though it possesses distinct features such as nerd glasses and a gold earring on its right ear. It also wears a red scarf.

SCP-6073 identifies as a programmer and appears to possess a high level of intelligence that surpasses most humans. Despite its species, SCP-6073 is fully capable of speech and can communicate like a human using voice and gestures.

The personality of SCP-6073 is that of a practical joker, always looking for ways to entertain those around it. It enjoys telling jokes, reciting humorous stories, and doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Though entertaining, these antics can cause disruptions in containment procedures and pose a risk to on-site personnel.

SCP-6073 treats all those around it with respect and politeness, though it is known to get quite excited when discussing programming languages and new technological advancements. Its demeanor and speech patterns are notably refined, indicating a higher level of education and intelligence.

Addendum: SCP-6073 has requested access to a computer and data library to further its programming studies. This request has been denied due to concerns over the subject's potential ability to hack Foundation systems. Research into SCP-6073's unique species origins and abilities is ongoing.
