Item #: SCP-2177

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2177 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. The item should be provided with a steady supply of creative outlets, such as puzzles and books, to prevent boredom and increase positive behavior.

SCP-2177 is permitted occasional excursions under direct supervision for the purpose of completing assigned tasks as a delivery driver for the Foundation. The item must wear its medical mask and red scarf at all times outside of the containment chamber.

Description: SCP-2177 is a human male with a distinct mouth spot and jade LED eyes. It wears a retro cap and green cross earring as well as a red scarf and medical mask.

An anomalous ability of SCP-2177 is its natural propensity for brainstorming and creativity. It enjoys coming up with new and innovative ideas, which can occasionally lead to comical responses or outlandish solutions to problems. However, this trait can be beneficial in certain situations, as SCP-2177 has demonstrated a knack for finding new approaches to difficult issues.

Addendum: Incident Report 2177-01

On ██/██/████, SCP-2177 was delivering a package to Site-██ when it encountered a Level 3 containment breach involving several aggressive SCPs. Instead of following standard safety procedures, SCP-2177 suggested utilizing the contents of the package to subdue the creatures.

While initially hesitant to such an unconventional idea, Foundation personnel ultimately decided to follow SCP-2177's lead, and the plan successfully neutralized the rogue SCPs. As a result of this incident, SCP-2177's brainstorming abilities have been classified as potentially useful, and further testing is pending.
