Item #: 3689

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3689 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with all visitors required to wear protective face masks. No physical contact or prolonged interaction with subject 3689 is allowed, and any attempts to engage in dialogue in excess of 30 minutes must be logged and monitored for potential memetic hazards.

Description: Subject 3689 is a female humanoid of human origin and identified as a fashion designer by profession. They possess a distinctively green hair, which appears to be unkempt and unstyled. The subject's most notable facial feature is a broad, almost maniacal, smile that has been observed to be constantly present on their face even when not appropriate.

Additionally, subject 3689's eyes are a bright red color, similar to that of a clown, which is unsettling to some individuals. Subject 3689 also bears a medical mask covering their mouth, with a red cross earring on their ears, and a two-color band on their forehead as a form of self-expression. DogeSoundClub researchers speculate that these adornments are an attempt to intimidate others into avoiding conflict with the subject.

Subject 3689 exhibits a highly analytical and logical personality, capable of dissecting complex ideas and theories as well as presenting counter-arguments to most discussions they have been involved in despite the consequences. However, the subject has shown to engage in heated debates on trivial topics that others find unimportant or irrelevant, which could be a result of them forcefully attempting to assert their dominance â€” a trait that's proven harmful for other DogeSoundClub researchers.

Addendum: Following Incident 3689-1, the subject's memetic abilities should not be ignored, especially in verbal communication. The subject is scheduled for a behavior modification therapy session to suppress some of these tactics.
