SCP-4079, designated as "The Clown Electrician" is a human male with an extraordinary appearance. His retro cap and jade earring accentuate his vibrant orange stripes which run down his face. The most striking of his features, though, are his red clown eyes that rear in its sockets like a ghost in the night. SCP-4079 is known for its genial smile, which inherently raises the morale of the personnel. 

SCP-4079 works as an electrician and is a common figure seen in the maintenance areas of the facilities. He carries around a candy stick, an object in which he seems to find solace in times of stress.

SCP-4079's incredible personality is well-known among the SCP Foundation ranks. He has a unique nurturing quality, particularly towards those he deems to be his friends or family members. This quality often leads to him taking care of his comrades, as if they were his children, resulting in rather amusing situations.

As with all SCP designates, extensive caution must be taken around SCP-4079, as his behavior has been known to be erratic under various conditions. Further research is ongoing as to the nature of SCP-4079's anomalous abilities.
