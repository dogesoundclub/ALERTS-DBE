It is recognized by its orange stripes combined with a red lip and orange eyebrows that seem to change color depending on her mood. The creature wears a bucket hat with a two-color band on its forehead, matching its orange stripes, and a medical mask that partially reveals the Jade earrings she wears.

SCP-7586 is often seen wearing a choker around her neck, which appears to have anomalous properties. The creature has a lively and humorous personality and may use its sense of humor to manipulate others. SCP-7586's ability to make jokes and lighten the mood can lead to humorous scenarios that can divert any attention away from her true intentions. SCP-7586 is the subject of further investigation due to her ability to mask her true intentions through her comedic persona.
