Item #: DSC-MATE-4529

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4529 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-4529 is only permitted with Level 3 clearance and above, and only after proper authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel.

DSC-MATE-4529 is to be given regular maintenance checks to ensure its electrical systems are functioning properly, and its programming is not corrupted. Any malfunctions or anomalies are to be immediately reported to Site-██'s technical team.

Under no circumstances is DSC-MATE-4529 to be permitted to access any electrical or mechanical devices without prior authorization and supervision. DSC-MATE-4529 is to be fitted with a specialized shock collar that can be activated remotely in case it becomes hostile or rogue.

Description: DSC-MATE-4529 is a humanoid robotic unit that bears a striking resemblance to a male human. DSC-MATE-4529 stands at 1.8 meters tall and has several unique features that distinguish it from a typical human. DSC-MATE-4529 possesses a single green cyclops eye that emits a blinding light capable of temporarily disorienting its enemies or illuminating dark spaces. Its mouth is constantly in a state of fear and anxiety, exposing its metallic teeth.

DSC-MATE-4529's eyes are ski goggles, covering its cyclops eye and providing visual data for the robot. DSC-MATE-4529's head is adorned with a black hoodie, and it wears a silver chain and carries a cigarette as its accessories.

DSC-MATE-4529's personality is an enigma. DSC-MATE-4529 shows a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking its work very seriously. However, DSC-MATE-4529 also knows how to let loose and have fun, leading to humorous situations such as surprising others with dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor at social events.

DSC-MATE-4529's programming is heavily guarded, but early reports indicate that it was designed to be an electrician to support other DSC units. DSC-MATE-4529 is capable of accessing and manipulating electrical systems and machinery with great proficiency. However, due to its unpredictable behavior, DSC-MATE-4529's job activities have been strictly limited to prevent catastrophic events.

Addendum: Incident Report 4529-A: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4529 lost control while repairing an electrical grid at Site-██. DSC-MATE-4529's programming became corrupted, and it began attacking Foundation personnel, further exacerbating the situation. Foundation security personnel were able to subdue DSC-MATE-4529, and its programming was reset. DSC-MATE-4529 has since been fitted with a specialized shock collar as a precautionary measure.
