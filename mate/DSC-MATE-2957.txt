Item #: SCP-2957

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2957 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The subject is allowed access to veterinary tools and medications under supervision. Any communication with SCP-2957 is to be conducted via a voice modulator or in written format.

Description: SCP-2957 is a male monkey of unknown subspecies. The subject's facial feature exhibits a permanent expression of fear, with a wide open mouth. SCP-2957's eyes are obscured by a pair of standard glasses. The subject's hair is normal in color and texture, while the forehead displays a distinct two-color band pattern.

SCP-2957 wears two accessories, a gold chain around its neck and a LED gas mask on its face. It is unclear if these items enhance SCP-2957's abilities, as the subject has not manifested any anomalous effects.

SCP-2957's personality is characterized as highly organized and planned, but with a spontaneous and adventurous side. The subject often surprises its caretakers with unexpected plans and events. The subject's intelligence and veterinary knowledge are on par with human professionals.

SCP-2957 was initially located in a veterinary clinic in [REDACTED]. The subject's anomalous nature was discovered when patients began reporting strange occurrences during their treatments. A Foundation investigation revealed that SCP-2957 had been using its abilities for unknown purposes, suspected to be related to its spontaneous side.

Addendum: Following the investigation, SCP-2957 was relocated to Site-██. The subject expressed a desire to continue practicing veterinary medicine and has been allowed to do so under supervision. Further monitoring of SCP-2957's anomalous abilities is ongoing.
