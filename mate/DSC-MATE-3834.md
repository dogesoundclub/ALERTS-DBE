Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3834 is to be contained in a maximum-security facility with reinforced steel walls and a team of guards on 24-hour watch.

Description: 3834 is a female human characterized by her bright green hair, purple cap, and red cross earring. She is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck and smoking a cigarette. Her most notable feature is her wide, infectious smile that seems to charm those around her.

3834 is a cunning and manipulative villain, always seeking to further her own personal gain at the expense of others. While she values social connections and harmony, her methods of achieving them often involve deception, theft, and violence. Her goofiness and playful banter mask the cold and calculating mind underneath, making her a particularly dangerous individual.

Despite her villainous nature, 3834 has shown a penchant for humor, often telling a joke or two to break the tension in a situation. However, her jokes often have a darker side, and are more likely to cause discomfort than laughter.

It is imperative that 3834 be kept under strict observation, as her intelligence and unpredictability make her a significant threat to society. Any sightings or interactions with 3834 should be reported immediately to the proper authorities.
