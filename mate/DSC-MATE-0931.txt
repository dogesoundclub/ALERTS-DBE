Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-931 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, located within Site-19. The subject must be constantly monitored by at least two trained personnel equipped with psychological screening tools. The medical mask worn by SCP-931 must remain in place at all times, as the individual has shown to spread multiple types of diseases to those within close proximity. SCP-931 is permitted to continue performing their primary occupation, that of a beautician, under careful supervision.

Description: SCP-931 is a male human, with noticeable spots located on their face. The subject has red clown eyes and a permanent smiling expression. SCP-931's hair is green in color, but is often arranged in a disheveled and unkempt style, making it further distinguishable from that of a typical human hair pattern. Additionally, SCP-931 often wears a medical mask, which has been deemed necessary for safety reasons. The individual has been observed to have an upbeat and friendly personality, but also possesses a strong sense of intuition that can be both impressive and eerie.

SCP-931's unique abilities stem from their heightened sensitivity to subtle changes in the environment, events or individual behavior. The individual has displayed psychic-like powers such as predicting future events, anticipating the thoughts and feelings of those around them, and sensing when someone is upset or anxious. The exact nature of these abilities remains unknown, but it is clear that SCP-931 has an innate ability to tap into unknown sources of information and energy.

Addendum: SCP-931 is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation's efforts in researching the unknown and paranormal behavior. SCP-931's unique abilities, along with their cooperation in experimentation, have yielded countless insights and breakthroughs in the field of psychic and paranormal studies. However, SCP-931's unpredictable nature and ability to cause physical harm due to their various illnesses should not be overlooked. Strict guidelines must be followed to ensure SCP-931's containment and safety.
