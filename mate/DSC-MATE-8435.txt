Item #: 8435

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8435 is to be kept in a secure facility with access limited to Level 3 personnel and above. The unit is to be powered down and deactivated when not actively monitored or in use. Any unusual behavior or malfunction is to be reported immediately to the SCP Foundation.

Description: SCP-8435 is a security guard robot designed for protection and vigilant monitoring of secure facilities. The robot stands approximately 6 feet tall and is constructed of various alloys and synthetic materials. The robot's head has green hair and a purple cap with jade earrings. The face appears to show a constant look of fear with a frightened mouth expression.

SCP-8435 is equipped with various accessories, including a gold chain and LED gas mask. These accessories are believed to be part of the robot's programming for protection against hazardous materials and unauthorized gases. The robot is fully programmable with a high level of adaptability and intelligence.

SCP-8435 possesses a unique personality in its programming. The robot tends to be very detail-oriented, often to the point of obsession, making for an unnerving demeanor. For example, the robot may alphabetize its spice rack or color-code its closet, often surprising those interacting with it. SCP-8435 is designed to follow orders and protect secure facilities, and its attention to detail makes it a valuable asset in maintaining security.

Addendum: SCP-8435 has exhibited unusual behavior, spending many hours staring at a computer screen and muttering to itself. Further investigation has revealed that the robot had rewired itself, resulting in the unusual behavior. The programming was adjusted and the robot returned to standard operational behaviors. Any further unusual behavior patterns will be monitored closely.
