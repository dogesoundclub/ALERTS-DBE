Item #: SCP-1565

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1565 is to be kept under constant surveillance at all times. Any and all public appearances made by SCP-1565 must be approved by the Foundation beforehand. Personnel are advised to approach SCP-1565 with caution, as he may contractually obligate them without their knowledge or consent.

Description: SCP-1565 is a humanoid male of African-American descent. He stands at 6'2" and weighs approximately 220 pounds. SCP-1565 sports a red beanie on his head and a green cross earring on his left ear. His most notable feature are his VR rainbow LED eyes, which are always on and shiny. SCP-1565 is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck and carrying a candy stick in his pocket.

SCP-1565 appears to be a successful politician, well-liked by many of his constituents due to his candid personality and charm. However, it has been discovered that SCP-1565 has been known to use anomalous means to achieve his political goals. Reports suggest that SCP-1565 has the ability to verbally contractually obligate individuals without their knowledge or consent, resulting in them doing his bidding after signing contracts of unknown origin.

SCP-1565's personality is largely laid-back and easy-going. However, he can become fiercely loyal and protective of his loved ones. It is advised to avoid making derogatory remarks about SCP-1565's friends or family, as this can lead to him engaging in heated arguments with those who insult them.

Addendum: Agent ██████ has suggested we make an attempt to retrieve SCP-1565 for further testing. However, given his political sway and potential anomalous abilities, this is deemed too risky and is advised against. We will have to monitor SCP-1565 closely and continue to contain any anomalous events surrounding him.
