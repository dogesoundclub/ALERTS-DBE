Item #: SCP-6461

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6461 is to be allowed to continue his post as a police officer, with regular check-ins and evaluations to ensure his anomalous properties do not manifest in public. SCP-6461 is to be provided with a plainclothes gas mask and all public appearances are to be vetted by Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-6461 is a human male of average height and weight. SCP-6461 has blue clown eyes and a wide smile that is present even when not actively attempting to appear happy. The subject wears a short peak cap on his head and has a gold earring on each ear. SCP-6461 also wears a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-6461 possesses a significant level of natural charm and charisma. The subject has a talent for making others laugh and is often the life of the party. Those around SCP-6461 experience a heightened sense of euphoria and happiness when in his presence, and the subject is able to alter the mood of a room with relative ease.

When SCP-6461 is interacting with others in a social or professional setting, his anomalous properties are most pronounced. SCP-6461 will often tell jokes or do silly dances, leading to humorous situations.

SCP-6461's gas mask, while seemingly normal, is capable of neutralizing his anomalous properties. When worn, the mask prevents SCP-6461 from affecting those around him, rendering him a normal human.

Addendum: SCP-6461 has been instrumental in various operations involving negotiations with potentially dangerous anomalous entities. His abilities have been particularly useful in deescalating tense situations, and he has a success rate of 87% in such scenarios. However, Foundation personnel are reminded that SCP-6461 must still be treated as an anomalous entity and measures must be taken to prevent his abilities from causing public harm.
