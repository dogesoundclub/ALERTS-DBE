Item #: 2125

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2125 is to be contained within the confines of its designated workplace, a theater located in ████████. 2125 is not allowed to exit the premises unless accompanied by at least two personnel with authorization from the Foundation. The theater is to be monitored at all times by security cameras and personnel are to check in with 2125 daily to examine any deviations from standard routines. If any unusual behaviors or activities are detected, 2125 is to be quarantined and subsequently observed until further notice.

Description: Subject 2125 is a human male of average height and build. The most remarkable feature of its face is the presence of numerous spots, which appear to be permanent. Its eyes are unremarkable except for the fact that it wears glasses. Its head is usually covered with a hooded sweatshirt, which obscures its hair and ears. Though it has a mouth, it prefers to wear a medical mask which obscures its lower face. The only accessory it wears is a gold chain around its neck.

Subject 2125 has displayed a strong sense of independence and a resistance to authority, often displaying rebellious behavior such as leaving work early or taking days off without permission. While it has not displayed any supernatural abilities, it is not recommended for direct interaction by Foundation personnel due to the unpredictable nature of its behavior.

Addendum: Personnel are reminded that while subject 2125 may appear unremarkable, it is imperative that they adhere to established containment procedures at all times. Any security breaches or deviations from standard routines must be immediately reported to Supervisory Personnel.
