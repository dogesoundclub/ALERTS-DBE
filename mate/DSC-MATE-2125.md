Its eyes are unremarkable except for the fact that it wears glasses. Its head is usually covered with a hooded sweatshirt, which obscures its hair and ears. Though it has a mouth, it prefers to wear a medical mask which obscures its lower face. The only accessory it wears is a gold chain around its neck.
