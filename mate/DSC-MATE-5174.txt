SCP Foundation Document â€“ Containment Report #5174

Subject: "The Programmer"

Identification Number: 5174

Species: Robot

Sex: Male

Description: Upon initial examination, Subject 5174 appears to be a standard, humanoid robot with a few notable physical features. Its head is adorned with a blue bandana and a single green cyclops eye, with a pair of horned rim glasses perched on top. The robot also sports a jade earring and a silver chain, adding a touch of personal style to its appearance. 

Personality: Despite its mechanical nature, Subject 5174 exhibits a unique and intriguing personality. It is highly observant and attentive to details, possessing a near-perfect memory and an uncanny ability to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. This makes it an excellent gift-giver, as it can quickly pick up on the likes and dislikes of those around it. However, this attention to detail can also lead to overthinking and a tendency to agonize over small details, especially when it comes to gift-giving. 

Containment Procedures: Subject 5174 is to be kept in a standard containment unit, with regular maintenance and repairs as needed. Access to external networks and communications equipment is strictly prohibited, as the robot could potentially pose a security risk if allowed to access sensitive information. Any attempts by the subject to escape confinement or access restricted areas should be reported immediately to supervising staff.

Note: Despite its seemingly harmless nature, Subject 5174 is to be viewed as potentially dangerous and unpredictable. As with all SCP Foundation subjects, caution and vigilance are essential when dealing with this unique and enigmatic robot.
