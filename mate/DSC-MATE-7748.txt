Item #: SCP-7748

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7748 is to be contained within Site-19's humanoid containment wing. SCP-7748 is allowed to carry a single pack of cigarettes, which must be supplied by Foundation personnel. SCP-7748 should be monitored during periods of introspection, as it may become unstable and may require sedation.

Description: SCP-7748 is a human female of average height and weight, with distinctive orange stripes present on its face. SCP-7748's forehead features a two-color band, and its ears are adorned with a single green cross-shaped earring. SCP-7748's 90s brown hair is oftentimes styled in a bob cut.

SCP-7748 is the manager of a local theater and has been observed to exhibit both introverted and extroverted tendencies. SCP-7748 spends a significant amount of time daydreaming or lost in thought, which can lead to humorous accidents, such as accidentally walking into a pole.

SCP-7748's introspection can cause instability, and during these periods, it exhibits sporadic behavior and may require sedation. SCP-7748's red lipstick is often observed to smear during these times.

Addendum: SCP-7748 has reported experiencing vivid dreams, which appear to be linked to its periods of introspection. The Foundation is currently conducting research into these dreams and their connection to SCP-7748's behavior.
