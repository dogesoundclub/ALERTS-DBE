Item #: SCP-2708

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2708 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber outfitted with fire suppression equipment. Interactions with SCP-2708 are to be kept to a minimum, and any medical attention is to be provided solely by non-humanoid personnel. SCP-2708 is not to be used in any firefighting duties under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-2708 is a female human who presents with spots on her face, red lipstick, pig tails, and a goggle on her forehead at all times. She is also frequently seen sporting a red cross earring, gold chain, and a medical mask. Despite her physical appearance, SCP-2708 is highly trained in fire suppression and holds a profession as a firefighter.

SCP-2708's personality is highly analytical and logical, often engaging in debates and arguments for the sake of intellectual stimulation. While this trait can lead to humor in some situations, it has also proved to be a hindrance in times of high stress or emergency response. SCP-2708 has been known to delay emergency response procedures in order to argue over minor details or to prove a point.

SCP-2708's abilities have been noted to be exceptional in fire suppression, though the extent of her capabilities is currently unknown. Due to potential danger to both SCP-2708 and ongoing operations, she is not to be utilized in any firefighting duties. 

Addendum: During a routine physical examination, it was discovered that SCP-2708's medical mask was not being worn purely for protective purposes, but to prevent the manifestation of an anomalous effect. SCP-2708's containment procedures have been revised accordingly.
