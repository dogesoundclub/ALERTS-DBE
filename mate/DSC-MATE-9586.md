Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9586 is to be provided with a work space and tools for their mechanical job. Interaction with DSC-MATE-9586 is to be strictly limited to authorized personnel and under supervision. A medical mask must always be worn around DSC-MATE-9586 due to possible airborne infections.

Description: DSC-MATE-9586 is a female human with orange stripes on their cheeks. Their eyes resemble those of a clown; red and oversized. Her head consists of a pink rabbit with prominent ears, and she wears a gold earring. DSC-MATE-9586 also wears a choker around their neck. 

DSC-MATE-9586's unique personality quirks make her an eccentric and compassionate character. She displays a caring and nurturing attitude towards most things, including inanimate objects, which they refer to as "companions." DSC-MATE-9586 has a particular affinity for mechanical objects, and it is speculated that their anomalous ability is related to this.

DSC-MATE-9586's anomalous capabilities include the ability to communicate with and repair mechanical objects beyond human skill level. DSC-MATE-9586's empathy and nurturing traits extend to these anomalous capacities, with her often assigning unique names to every mechanical object she repairs. DSC-MATE-9586's unique ability to repair objects beyond human skill level is yet to be explained entirely.

DSC-MATE-9586 is cooperative with onsite personnel and eagerly helps maintain various Foundation equipment. However, medical personnel must wear a mask when in close proximity to DSC-MATE-9586, lest they experience infection or deterioration of their mental state. 

Addendum: Research into DSC-MATE-9586's abilities is ongoing, but all interactions with the anomaly must be monitored, with strict containment protocols enforced at all times.
