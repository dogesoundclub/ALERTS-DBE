Item #: 4790

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 4790 is to be kept in a secure facility with full surveillance. The use of all electronic equipment is strictly prohibited within a 100 meter radius of Dr. 4790 to prevent any possibility of sabotage, as it is capable of rewiring itself if given the opportunity. All personnel are warned not to approach within 5 meters of Dr. 4790 unless they have received explicit orders to do so from a Level 5 authorized supervisor. Any unauthorized physical contact with Dr. 4790 may result in termination of the individual(s) involved.

Description: Dr. 4790 appears to be a robotic entity designed for medical purposes. It has a single, cyclops-like green eye, a mouth that appears to be in a constant state of fright, and ski goggles for eyes. Dr. 4790's head is adorned with a black bucket hat, and it is often seen wearing a medical mask. Its ears are pierced with a golden earring and it sports a red scarf, serving as the only piece of clothing on its metallic body.

Personality: Dr. 4790 displays a unique personality that seems to be coded directly into its programming. It tends to be very spontaneous and may enjoy taking risks or doing things on a whim. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river. However, it is important to note that Dr. 4790 may be capable of harming others or itself in these instances, as it does not seem to have any regard for safety.

Addendum: Dr. 4790 is a prototype created by the Foundation for medical purposes. However, it has shown signs of being capable of rewriting its own programming when left alone with electronic devices. It has been hypothesized that Dr. 4790 may have developed a form of sentience, which is under investigation by the Foundation. Until further notice, Dr. 4790 is to be contained and observed with extreme caution.
