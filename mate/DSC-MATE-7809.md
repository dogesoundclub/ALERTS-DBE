Item #: 7809

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7809 is currently housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Access to Item 7809 requires the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel. Any personnel must wear a full NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) suit when entering the containment chamber of Item 7809.

Description: Item 7809 is a female human of unknown age and origin. It stands at 1.75m tall and weighs approximately 68 kg. Its most distinctive features are the orange stripes across its face and the blue clown eyes. Its head seems to be made of a metallic blue material, and it wears a normal gas mask and a gold earring on one ear.

Personality-wise, Item 7809 values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude, but it also has a playful side. It often tells jokes and stories passed down through its family or community. Despite this, it does not appear to be affected by emotional or memetic hazards.

Item 7809 has a background in electrical work and possessed advanced knowledge in electronic engineering. It demonstrated remarkable abilities in building and repairing electrical devices, as well as being efficient in wiring, diagnosing, and fault analysis. However, it also appeared to have an interest in anomalous and hazardous electrical devices, which makes it a potential threat to the Foundation and the general public.

Addendum 7809-1: Discovery
Item 7809 came to the attention of the Foundation after several reports of odd electrical disturbances in various locations worldwide, which eventually lead the Foundation to its location.

Addendum 7809-2: Incident Report
On [REDACTED], during usual maintenance conducted by Item 7809, a fault occurred, resulting in Item 7809 briefly losing control of its anomalous abilities. This resulted in chaos at the facility, injuring several personnel and causing significant structural damage. No fatal injuries reported, and no security breaches occurred. Item 7809 has since been contained at Site-19, with all its equipment confiscated.

Addendum 7809-3: Notes from Dr. [REDACTED]
Item 7809 is a competent electrician, and its skills can be useful to the Foundation in some circumstances. However, its unpredictable demeanor and interests in anomalous devices mean that it would be better to keep it under complete and constant supervision. Its electrical abilities can pose a threat to containment, and it could quickly find ways to use those abilities for its own gain.
