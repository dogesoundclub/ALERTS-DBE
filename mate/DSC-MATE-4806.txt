Item number 4806 is a peculiar sight to behold, even in this world of anomalies and oddities. This human male, who serves as a traffic officer, possesses a head of unruly green hair that seems to have a life of its own. His eyes, a mesmerizing shade of blue, are perhaps the most noticeable feature - they resemble the painted eyes of a clown, in contrast to the stoic expression on his face.

Item 4806 sports a jade earring in one ear, adding to his enigmatic appearance. The most curious feature, however, is the medical mask which he always wears, covering his mouth. Most attempts to remove the mask have been met with anger and threats of force.

Despite his stern and no-nonsense demeanor on the job, item 4806 has a playful side that surfaces when interacting with others who share his love of tradition. He values the ways of his family and community, often regaling his peers with stories and jokes that have been passed down through the generations.

Item 4806 remains under close observation, and any attempts to discover the reasons behind his unusual appearance and behavior are ongoing. Approach with caution.
