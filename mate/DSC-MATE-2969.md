Item #: 2969

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2969 is to be kept in a specially designed pen within the boundaries of the Foundation. Only personnel with Level 3 clearance are allowed to interact with 2969 due to the emotional effects it has on others. The pen must be cleaned and resupplied with food and water every day, and 2969 must be monitored at all times.

Description: Subject 2969 appears to be a male rabbit with peculiar features that distinguish it from other rabbits. Its eyes resemble ski goggles, and it possesses green hair tucked under a purple cap. 2969 also wears a gold chain and carries around a candy stick. The subject's most notable feature is its frightened mouth, which it keeps open most of the time.

2969's personality is highly emotional, and it often becomes moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. It has an inclination towards music or art that evokes strong feelings. 2969 also appears to be highly sensitive towards people's emotions, and its behavior is erratic when it senses someone is upset or angry.

Despite its benign nature, 2969 is capable of creating immense distress in those who witness it. Its emotional outbursts can cause uncontrollable weeping or unbridled rage in those who interact with it. This effect creates an increased risk of anomalous containment breach, and as such, 2969's containment must be managed with extreme caution.

Addendum: Subject 2969's anomalous nature is currently under investigation, and interviews with previous owners suggest it may have been the result of an unknown experiment. The origin of its unique features and emotional sensitivity are unknown, and further investigation is ongoing.
