SCP-7570, codenamed "The Striped Veterinarian," is a human female with distinct orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Her most noticeable feature is her VR Rainbow LED eyes, which are said to glow in the dark.

SCP-7570 is a valuable asset to the Foundation in dealing with anomalous creatures, as she can quickly and effectively diagnose injuries and treat them accordingly.
