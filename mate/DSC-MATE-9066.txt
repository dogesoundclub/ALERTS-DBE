SCP-9066 is a highly unusual specimen that has been assigned the designation of "Knowledge Seeker". This human female is easily recognized by their striking VR Rainbow LED eyes and Green Cross Earring. The subject additionally bears a Gold Chain and is frequently observed smoking a Cigarette. 

However, it is the personality of SCP-9066 that truly sets them apart. They possess an insatiable thirst for knowledge and display an almost obsessive desire to learn about even the most obscure topics. It is not uncommon for SCP-9066 to spend hours reading or researching, with a particular affinity for collecting books and educational materials. Remarkably, this fascination extends to the sharing of such knowledge with others, and SCP-9066 can exhibit a highly passionate and engaging demeanor when educating others on their newfound insights.

As a Firefighter, SCP-9066 has proven to be highly capable and efficient, displaying a level of dedication and proficiency that is highly valued by the Foundation. However, it is the subject's unique personality that has piqued the curiosity of many researchers and may hold the key to greater understanding of the nature of human cognition and behavior. As such, the Foundation continues to monitor SCP-9066's activities closely, with the hope of unlocking the secrets of their highly individualized approach to knowledge acquisition and sharing.
