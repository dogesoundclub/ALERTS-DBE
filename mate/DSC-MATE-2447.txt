Description: SCP-2447 is a police officer robot of unknown origin. Its exterior is mainly composed of steel and rubber, with the exception of its cycloptic green eye, which seems to be a form of energy-based sensor.

In addition, SCP-2447 wears a normal gas mask, which it requires in order to sustain its power source.

SCP-2447's personality is unique among robotic entities, as it displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, it is also capable of letting loose and having fun, sometimes to the point of humorous behavior. SCP-2447 has been observed surprising others with its dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor at social events.

SCP-2447's origins remain unknown, and no information on its creators or intended purpose has been discovered.

Addendum: SCP-2447 has been used several times to diffuse tense situations during containment breaches involving other SCPs. It has shown a remarkable ability to negotiate with other entities and unorthodox problem-solving skills. Its usefulness in containing SCPs is currently being evaluated.
