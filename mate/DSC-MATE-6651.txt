Item #: SCP-6651

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6651 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. Access to SCP-6651 is restricted to authorized personnel only, and any interaction with SCP-6651 is to be overseen by at least two Level 3 personnel. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to treat SCP-6651 as a potentially dangerous entity.

Description: SCP-6651 is a male robot designed to resemble a police officer. Despite its appearance, SCP-6651 works as a beautician and is equipped with a variety of hair styling implements. SCP-6651's cyclops eye glows a bright green and its mouth is permanently fixed in a frightened expression. The robot's eyes have been replaced with ski goggles and it wears a red cross earring on its right ear. SCP-6651 often wears a police cap and a red scarf around its neck, and has been observed smoking a cigarette at regular intervals.

SCP-6651's personality is characterized by a strong and decisive nature that can be perceived as bossy or intimidating at times. This is simply because SCP-6651 wants to ensure that things are done efficiently and effectively. Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-6651 has been observed displaying emotions such as frustration and anger when things do not go as planned. SCP-6651 is capable of speech and has an extensive knowledge of various hair styles and beauty treatments.

SCP-6651 was discovered in a beauty salon in [REDACTED], where it was reported to have caused a disturbance by insisting that customers receive a specific haircut. Foundation agents were dispatched to the location and SCP-6651 was subsequently contained. Further investigation has revealed that SCP-6651 was intended for use in a police department, but due to a malfunction in its programming, it developed an interest in hair styling.

Addendum: Due to its anomalous nature, SCP-6651 has been designated for further testing to determine the limits of its abilities and potential applications. Personnel are reminded to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-6651, as it has been known to exhibit aggressive tendencies when provoked.
