Item #: 493

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Reporter

Species: Monkey

Gender: Male

Appearance: The subject has a frightened mouth that is almost constantly agape in a state of anxious confusion. Their eyes are not easily discernible due to the normal gas mask that they are always wearing. The subject can often be seen with a red scarf around their neck, which seems to be a source of comfort or reassurance for them.

Personality: This anomalous primate displays a tendency towards spontaneity and a reckless disregard for their own safety. They frequently engage in impulsive and dangerous behaviors that border on madness, such as jumping off cliffs into bodies of water without any regard for the potential consequences. It is unclear if this behavior is a result of the subject's SCP designation, or if it is simply an inherent aspect of their personality.

Containment Procedures: The subject is to be kept in a secure, reinforced enclosure that has been specifically designed to withstand any destructive tendencies that the subject may display. The subject is to be provided with appropriate food, water, and environmental enrichment on a regular basis to prevent any potential psychological deterioration. Personnel entering the enclosure are required to wear appropriate protective gear, including gas masks, as well as taking all necessary precautions to avoid any possible physical harm.

Description: SCP-493 was discovered wandering the streets at night displaying odd, erratic behavior that drew the attention of local law enforcement. When apprehended, the subject was found to be wearing a gas mask and a red scarf for unknown reasons. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the subject was intelligent and capable of human-like communications.

SCP-493's anomalous properties include a tendency towards impulsive and reckless behavior that can potentially harm themselves and others, leading to their classification as a Euclid-class anomaly. It is currently under containment at Site-19 for observation and study, and any additional information on its origin and properties is highly sought after.
