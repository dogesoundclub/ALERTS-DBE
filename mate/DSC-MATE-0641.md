Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-641 is to be kept within a standard containment chamber lined with jungle foliage, to maintain a suitable environment for its species. Its enclosure should be equipped with ample stimuli, such as television screens with news programs, books, and toys, to keep it entertained and engaged. Feeding must be done thrice a day, and the diet must be in keeping with a Monkey's nutritional requirements.

DSC-MATE-641 has been assigned to be the lead newscaster for public broadcasting stations, and protocols are put in place in case of any incidents. A team of four Foundation agents is to accompany DSC-MATE-641 during all broadcast activities, keeping it under strict supervision and monitoring. In the event that DSC-MATE-641 manifests any anomalous abilities or causes an incident, the transmission must be immediately shut down, and DSC-MATE-641 should be brought back to the containment chamber for further evaluation.

Description: DSC-MATE-641 is an anomalous Monkey of the genus Macaca, with a unique physical appearance. Its head is perpetually covered by a black hoodie with two color bands running horizontally. DSC-MATE-641's eyes are a startling red, resembling clown makeup, and are known to shift in color depending on its emotional state. DSC-MATE-641 is mostly docile but will display sudden aggressive behaviors when it perceives a threat to its safety.

DSC-MATE-641's most notable feature is its high level of empathy and compassion towards humans. It is highly perceptive to emotions and can often deduce the nature of someone's distress through their body movements or vocal tone. This characteristic makes DSC-MATE-641 an excellent newscaster, able to convey stories and events with a deep understanding of how they affect the public.

DSC-MATE-641's tendency to take on other people's problems as its own has led to concern among Foundation staff. Psychological evaluations have revealed that DSC-MATE-641's personality could cause it stress and burnout in the future.

DSC-MATE-641 has also displayed attachment to a candy stick, using it as a comfort item when feeling anxious.

Addendum: Due to its exceptional skills, DSC-MATE-641's employment as a newscaster is approved and supervised by the Foundation. However, it is imperative that DSC-MATE-641's anomalous nature is concealed from the general public to prevent the panic and chaos that might ensue.
