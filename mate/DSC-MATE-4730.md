Item #: 4730 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4730 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment quarters at Site-██. Regular interactions with personnel are encouraged to maintain DSC-MATE-4730's mental well-being. Any necessary repairs relating to mechanical equipment at Site-██ may be requested through the proper channels for DSC-MATE-4730's aid. Permission must be granted by at least two Level 3 personnel before DSC-MATE-4730 is allowed to leave containment for any non-work related events. 

Description: DSC-MATE-4730 is a female human with a retro style cap and red cross earring. Her most distinguishable features are her purple lips and jade-green LED cybernetic eyes. Her choice of apparel includes a silver chain and LED gas mask. DSC-MATE-4730 is employed in repairing mechanical equipment and machinery within Site-██ which shows no anomalous properties. Despite her appearance, it is believed that DSC-MATE-4730 has no anomalous properties. 

DSC-MATE-4730 exhibits an outgoing and social personality, often seeking to be the center of attention. She is known for her humor and has an affinity for telling jokes and stories that leave her audience laughing uncontrollably. These traits may have been amplified post-cybernetic augmentation; however, no scientific evidence has been produced to support this theory. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4730 was brought into Foundation custody after a routine cybernetic implantation scan revealed her cybernetic eyes. She was initially apprehensive but cooperative during the containment process. Further research revealed that DSC-MATE-4730 had no prior knowledge of her cybernetic upgrades, suggesting that they were implemented without her consent. Upon further questioning, no knowledge of the implantation was uncovered. Further investigations are underway to determine the origin of DSC-MATE-4730's cybernetic enhancements.
