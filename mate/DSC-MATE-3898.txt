Item #: 3898

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3898 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of SCP-3898's job, its containment chamber has been modified to include a studio set resembling that of a news anchor. SCP-3898 is allowed a teleprompter which it must read from twice a day for a scheduled broadcast. Any deviation from the teleprompter script is to result in immediate intervention from Mobile Task Force Theta-6 ("The Monkey Wrenches").

Description: SCP-3898 is a male monkey of an unknown species with an interest in human news broadcasting. SCP-3898 appears to be no different from a typical monkey, except for a pair of goggles it wears on its forehead and a gold earring in one ear. Its behavior is akin to that of a human news anchor, with a deep interest in the world and a tendency to search for obscure and unusual topics to cover during its broadcast.

SCP-3898 is fluent in multiple human languages and possesses the ability to not only read but also understand news feeds from various stations, which it then reports in its broadcast. Its deep curiosity often leads to it spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, regardless of whether they are interested or not.

SCP-3898 has been observed to mimic human behaviors, including adjusting its glasses and using appropriate hand gestures while reporting. Although SCP-3898's abilities are currently limited to broadcasting news, further studies are underway to determine its full potential.

Addendum: Due to its tendency to go off-script and its abnormal behavior, SCP-3898 has been assigned to Mobile Task Force Theta-6 ("The Monkey Wrenches") for immediate intervention in case of any deviation from the designated broadcast script. Further research is required to understand the true nature of SCP-3898 and its capabilities.
