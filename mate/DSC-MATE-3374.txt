Item #: SCP-3374

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3374 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, and is to be provided with a medical mask at all times. Any attempt to remove the mask should be reported immediately to the Site Director. Additionally, SCP-3374 is to be provided with means to satisfy her spontaneous nature within the confines of the containment chamber.

Description: SCP-3374 is a female human with unique features. Their face is marked with orange stripes of unknown origin, and their eyes are a bright blue with a clown-like appearance. Their head is described as "not arranged green", which is believed to refer to abnormalities in their brain structure; however, no abnormalities have been detected through medical examinations. SCP-3374 also wears a choker as an accessory.

SCP-3374 is a highly spontaneous individual who enjoys taking risks and acting on whims. This has led to several dangerous situations, such as jumping off cliffs into water sources. Although SCP-3374 is aware of the risks, they appear to derive pleasure from such circumstances.

SCP-3374 was originally discovered working as a banker, and was contained after several reports of their erratic behavior were made. It is believed that SCP-3374's anomalous abilities may have been triggered by a traumatic event that occurred during childhood, though this remains unverified.

Addendum: Attempts to remove SCP-3374's medical mask have resulted in SCP-3374 exhibiting aggressive behavior. It is uncertain whether the mask is a necessary component of SCP-3374's containment, or whether it is related to SCP-3374's anomalous properties. Research is ongoing.
