Item #: 4313

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4313 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-███. SCP-4313’s access to the outside world must be limited, as they may pose a threat to the general public due to their intimidating personality. They are only allowed to leave their cell for work as a Traffic Officer, while accompanied by Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-4313 is a male human with blue clown eyes, who wears a medical mask and a police cap with goggles on the forehead. They have a gold earring on one ear and a silver chain around their neck. SCP-4313’s most notable feature is their frightened mouth expression, which they display even when not afraid.

SCP-4313 behaves as a typical Traffic Officer, but they have a strong and decisive personality that sometimes intimidates those around them. They believe in efficiency and effectiveness in their work, which can make them appear bossy. It is worth noting that SCP-4313 has not shown any malice towards civilians or other Foundation personnel and performs their job efficiently and effectively.

Addendum: SCP-4313 has shown a resistance to cognitohazards, although the exact extent of their resistance is unknown. Foundation personnel are advised to limit their exposure to SCP-4313’s gaze unless necessary. Further testing is being conducted to determine the full extent of their abilities.
