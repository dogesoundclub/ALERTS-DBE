Item #: 6437

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6437 is to be allowed to continue their occupation as a train driver with medical supervision. Special attention should be paid to any memory loss or distraction-related incidents. Any anomalous activity noted by or experienced by passengers on trains operated by 6437 should be reported to local authorities and contained as necessary.

Description: Subject 6437 is an adult human male with orange stripes adorning their face. They possess blue clown eyes that are both hypnotic and unsettling. The top of their head forms to a peak spike, and their ears are pierced with a distinctive green cross earring.

Although fully human, 6437 exhibits a peculiar personality. They have a tendency to become distracted and forgetful. This can result in miscommunication and confusion, which can trigger laughter from those around them. For example, they may forget a scheduled appointment or take a wrong turn while driving. This forgetful behavior appears unassociated with distress or amnesia.

When undergoing long stretches of work or intense mediation, 6437 has caused anomalous activity. The sightings involving manifestations of phantasmic passengers are spreading in vast amounts at an uncontrollable rate. Scattered reports suggest the appearance of ghosts, apparitions, and unnatural happenings.

Despite attempts to alter 6437's behavior through medication, no remedies have successfully alleviated their anomalous actions. It is known that if exposed to high-pressure situations, 6437 brings forth a new type of entity. Testing on this ability is deemed too hazardous to continue.

This individual poses a continuing risk to containment, and their behavior is a source of concern for Foundation personnel assigned to monitor and supervise them.
