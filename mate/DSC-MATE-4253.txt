Item #: SCP-4253

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4253 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with reinforced walls lined with sonic dampeners. The chamber is to be checked daily for any signs of tampering, and any suspicious activity is to be reported to the Site Director immediately.

SCP-4253 is to be fed a diet consisting of raw meat and live prey, as well as supplements to ensure optimal health. SCP-4253 is not to be allowed any communication with the outside world unless approved by Level-4 personnel.

Description: SCP-4253 is a male Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) with distinct facial features, including a perpetually frightened mouth and ski goggles for eyes. Other notable features include a purple cap with a headset, a silver chain, and a jade earring.

SCP-4253 has a highly organized personality and tends to plan for the future. However, it also displays a spontaneous side, which can lead to humorous situations. SCP-4253 has been observed surprising its friends with impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit.

SCP-4253 holds a prominent political position in the local government, which it uses to further its own agenda. Its speeches and actions have been highly effective in swaying public opinion to its favor.

Despite its organized and calculating demeanor, SCP-4253 has displayed remarkable loyalty to those it considers friends. However, this loyalty does not extend to anyone it perceives as a threat, leading to erratic and unpredictable behavior.

SCP-4253 is known to possess supernatural abilities, including heightened strength and agility, as well as the ability to communicate with other animals. SCP-4253 has also been observed displaying minor pyrokinetic abilities.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-4253 attempted to escape containment after it caught wind of a plan to relocate it to a more secure facility. The attempt was foiled by Foundation security personnel, and SCP-4253 was recontained without incident. A psychological evaluation and enhanced security measures have since been implemented.
