Item #: 9061

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9061 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Requests for personal items may be granted pending approval from a Level 3 researcher. SCP-9061 is allowed access to books and movies on the premise that they do not contain any supernatural or magical elements. A psychiatric evaluation will be conducted annually to ensure emotional stability.

Description: SCP-9061 is a human female of average height and weight. Their face is covered in black spots with a bright purple lip. SCP-9061's eyes are a blue clown-like color with a small nose ring. SCP-9061’s head is adorned with a rainbow-colored headband, and they wear gold earrings and a silver chain necklace. SCP-9061 is the theater manager of ████████ Theatre in ██████████.

SCP-9061's personality is quite unique. They are empathetic and compassionate to everyone they come across, which is an asset in their job. However, it can also be a liability as SCP-9061 tends to take on the problems of others as their own. There have been instances where SCP-9061 was observed to be emotionally drained and continues to work as if nothing were wrong. SCP-9061 is also indecisive and takes time to make sound judgments.

SCP-9061 displays no anomalous properties at this time, but research is ongoing. SCP-9061 does have an interest in the paranormal, which leads to them watching and reading horror-themed movies and books. They display a keen interest in the SCP Foundation and maintains a small collection of Foundation themed merchandise in their office.

Addendum: At this time, Site Director [REDACTED] has denied the request for SCP-9061 to be transferred to another occupation within the Foundation. SCP-9061's emotional intelligence is seldom found within the Foundation staff and, as such, is an asset in helping to maintain the emotional and mental wellbeing of the team.
