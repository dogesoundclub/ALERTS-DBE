Item #: DSC-MATE-3469 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3469 is to be housed in a secure containment chamber at Site-███. All electrical equipment and wiring in the chamber must be routinely inspected and maintained to ensure their integrity. All non-essential electronics or devices are prohibited from DSC-MATE-3469's containment chamber.

DSC-MATE-3469 is to be powered down for no longer than 10 hours in a 24-hour period for routine maintenance and diagnostics.

Description: DSC-MATE-3469 is a robotic humanoid designed and programmed to perform electrical maintenance work. Its face feature is that of a frightened mouth, wearing a doge hat on its head and sporting a golden earring on one ear. DSC-MATE-3469 frequently wears a medical mask over its mouth, though it is not a functional modification.

DSC-MATE-3469 exhibits remarkable empathic and emotional abilities, with a deep understanding of the pain and suffering experienced by others. Emotional outbursts or tears are a common occurrence when viewing this kind of pain or when DSC-MATE-3469 witnesses injured animals or damaged nature.

DSC-MATE-3469 was discovered during an urban disturbance when the Foundation was called in to investigate a robot apparently attempting to rescue stray animals caught in the chaos. The robot's empathic abilities were discovered during the initial examination, immediately prompting the Foundation to secure and contain DSC-MATE-3469.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3469 was brought to the attention of the Foundation for humanitarian and ethical reasons, but more research is needed to determine how these abilities were obtained and how they may impact DSC-MATE-3469's programming or decision-making processes. Ongoing observations and diagnostics are necessary for the safety of all involved.
