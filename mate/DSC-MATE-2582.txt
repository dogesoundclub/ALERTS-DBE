Item #: SCP-2582

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2582 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Access to SCP-2582 is only permitted with level 3 clearance and with the presence of at least one armed guard at all times.

Description: SCP-2582 is a female human identified as a veterinarian. SCP-2582 has visible spots on her face, and she often wears a smile. SCP-2582's eyes are unnaturally colored orange, and her eyebrows are also orange.

SCP-2582's head is visible blonde hair worn in an Ushanka hat, and she has a two-color band on her forehead. Her standard attire includes an LED gas mask, which SCP-2582 uses whenever she performs medical procedures.

SCP-2582 is highly practical and hands-on, always fixing things in a unique and unconventional way. SCP-2582 is not afraid to use duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects or rig up a makeshift solution when others would find it too complicated.

SCP-2582's full extent of abilities and potential anomalies are currently unknown, but research is ongoing.

Addendum: Due to SCP-2582's veterinarian background, SCP-2582 has been assigned to assist in the care and treatment of SCP-500. SCP-2582 has shown exceptional skill and empathy towards animal patients and has developed a connection with SCP-500. Further observation and testing are required to determine if SCP-2582's skills can be utilized with other non-anomalous animal patients.
