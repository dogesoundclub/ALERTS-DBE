Item #: SCP-9314

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9314 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its nature as a sentient and cooperative anomaly, it is permitted limited access to the facility's common areas outside of scheduled testing and interviews.

Description: SCP-9314 is a male Tiger, measuring approximately 1.9 meters in height and weighing 135kg. Its features include VR rainbow LED eyes, a not arranged green metallic head, a Jade earring on each ear, and a goggle-like device affixed to its forehead. Its mouth is covered by a medical mask.

SCP-9314 possesses a humanoid appearance and is capable of communicating fluently in English. The anomaly's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more than it can handle. SCP-9314 has expressed difficulty in organizing its workload within a singular day and tends to over-burden itself with an excessive number of tasks. This results in a charming trait of trying to carry too many objects at once, on duty or not.

SCP-9314's previous occupation was a car salesman. It is still interested in discussing automobiles and their mechanics, and shows a level of expertise regarding the same. It seems to have an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of vehicles and their performance. While SCP-9314 appears to be a generally amiable and cooperative anomaly, it displays significant anxiety when left idle, and will actively seek out work to fill its time.

Addendum 9314-a: Given SCP-9314's ability to integrate with human society, and the fact that it has not displayed any anomalous or unstable tendencies, a proposal for SCP-9314 to be released into the care of a responsible civilian master, on the condition that it commissioned to the Foundation for occasional testing and monitoring, is currently being considered.
