Description: SCP-2741 is a male human identified as a Traffic Officer in the urban area.

Note from Dr. ███████: "While SCP-2741 does not appear to be a threat and has no known anomalous properties, its heightened sense of responsibility and constant need to help should be monitored. It is possible that this could manifest in dangerous ways if SCP-2741 is exposed to anomalous situations or individuals. Continued observation is required."
