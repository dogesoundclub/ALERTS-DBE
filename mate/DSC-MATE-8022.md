Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8022 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its robotic nature, it should be checked regularly for any signs of malfunction or damage. Any repairs or changes to its programming must be approved by Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: DSC-MATE-8022 is a male robot who identified itself as a programmer. It stands at 173 cm, and its limbs are made of silver metallic material. Its head is covered in green hair with a purple cap, and it has a set of VR Rainbow LED eyes. DSC-MATE-8022 wears a medical mask over its frightened mouth and has gold earrings on its ears.

DSC-MATE-8022 appears to have a nervous disposition and can become visibly agitated in response to unexpected situations. While generally organized and reliable, it has difficulties accepting new ideas or adjusting its routine. As a result, it may encounter difficulties in dealing with unexpected challenges.

DSC-MATE-8022 is also fond of wearing a silver chain around its neck, which it regards as a treasured personal item. Attempts to remove this item from it have resulted in extreme resistance and protest.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8022 requested that it be allowed to program and code while in containment, citing this as essential to its programming and sense of self. This has been granted, with the provision that all work is subject to approval and verification by Site-██ supervisors.
