Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9880 is not to be allowed close proximity with mundane humans without prior approval from the Foundation. All interviews and interactions with 9880 must be carried out with caution and under the strictest surveillance to ensure the safety of all involved parties.

Description: Subject 9880 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. He appears to be in his early thirties and physically fit for his age. His hair is parted and dyed a bright pink color. He wears a red victory band on his forehead and a jade earring in each earlobe. He also dons a pair of nerd glasses and a silver chain around his neck.

The true source of his abilities is unknown, but 9880 displays a charismatic and persuasive personality, making him highly influential in the field of politics. Furthermore, his spontaneous and risk-taking tendencies could turn him into a highly unpredictable force if given the power to do so. It is unclear if these impulses stem from Subject 9880's own volition or some deeper supernatural influence.

Despite repeated attempts to gain access to Subject 9880's inner thoughts or motives, nothing conclusive has been found, leading the Foundation to suspect that he may be utilizing some form of mental manipulation.

To date, no incidents involving Subject 9880 have occurred, but the Foundation remains wary of the potential danger he poses.

Addendum: Interview Log with Subject 9880

Dr. ██████: Subject 9880, what do you believe to be your greatest political achievement to date?

Subject 9880: Heh, good question, Doc. I suppose passing the bill that created our new renewable energy initiative was pretty satisfying. But to be honest, I'm already thinking about the next big idea.

Dr. ██████: Interesting. And what motivates you to take risks in your personal life?

Subject 9880: (Laughs) Risk-taking? I'm not really sure what you're talking about, Doc. Life is too short to wait around for opportunities to come to you. Sometimes you have to go out and grab them by the horns, you know?

Dr. ██████: Yes, I see. And what are your long-term goals for your political career?

Subject 9880: Oh, world domination, of course. (Laughs) Just kidding. No, seriously, though, I want to make a real, lasting impact on our society. I want to help people, to make their lives better in any way I can. That's what it's all about. 

Dr. ██████: Thank you, Subject 9880. The interview is concluded. 

End Log.
