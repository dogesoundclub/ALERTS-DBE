Item #: 8878

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8878 should be housed in a standard containment cell and monitored at all times while in Foundation custody. Any interaction with the subject must be carried out by trained personnel wearing standard issue earplugs to prevent any accidental damage from the subject's unique attributes. Subject 8878's medical clearance must be confirmed before any medical treatment can be administered.

Description: Subject 8878 appears to be a male human with typical male features. However, they have a distinctive trait that sets them apart: their eyes are a VR rainbow LED. This is believed to be the result of an experimental procedure carried out by an unknown party prior to their discovery by the Foundation. Their hair is unremarkable save for the fact that it is blonde in a normal style for a man.

Subject 8878 wears a medical mask to cover their mouth and prevent the spread of germs, as they are a practicing doctor. They also wear a jade earring in one ear as a personal affectation.

Personality: Subject 8878 is a highly intelligent and charismatic individual. They have a great sense of humor and enjoy making others laugh, often telling funny stories or performing silly impersonations to cheerful those around them. Despite their playful nature their medical knowledge has proved invaluable to several undercover missions of the Foundation.

Addendum: Subject 8878's exceptional medical qualifications led to their recruitment by the Foundation for several covert operations in areas heavily affected by anomalous activity which proved highly successful.
