Item #: DSC-MATE-3065


Object Class: Safe


Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3065 is to be housed in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be fed a strictly vegetarian diet, and any interaction with staff is to be limited to authorized personnel only. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-3065 to communicate with non-authorized personnel are to be reported immediately to security personnel. 

Description: DSC-MATE-3065 is a male rabbit with jade LED eyes and a signature Doge hat. It possesses a strong sense of independence and stubbornness, which could lead to humorous situations. Despite its small size, DSC-MATE-3065 can move heavy objects with relative ease, and this could pose a potential threat if allowed to roam freely.

DSC-MATE-3065's accessories include a gold earring, a gold chain, and a whistle. The purpose of these items is unknown, but it is believed that DSC-MATE-3065 may have acquired them during its time as a car salesman prior to containment.

Personality: DSC-MATE-3065 has exhibited a strong sense of autonomy and self-reliance, even in situations where assistance may be necessary. This personality trait is believed to be related to its past profession as a car salesman, where it had to rely on its own skills to seal deals with clients. DSC-MATE-3065's stubbornness and reluctance to ask for help may impede containment procedures, and all personnel are advised to approach it with caution.

Addendum: Preliminary interviews with DSC-MATE-3065 suggest that it has some level of sentience and self-awareness. Further studies are required to confirm these findings, but it is recommended that DSC-MATE-3065's containment be upgraded in response to this possible discovery.
