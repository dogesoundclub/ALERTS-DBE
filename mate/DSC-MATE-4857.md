Item #: DSC-MATE-4857

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4857 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any interviews or interactions with DSC-MATE-4857 must be supervised by at least two armed guards due to their unpredictable behavior. Access to any live news broadcasting equipment must be restricted to Level 3 personnel only. DSC-MATE-4857 is allowed to continue working as a news anchor as long as they comply with embedded Foundation agents' instructions.

Description: DSC-MATE-4857 is a humanoid female identified by the Foundation as [REDACTED], a well-known news anchor. DSC-MATE-4857's anomalous properties become apparent when they become spontaneous and impulsive, leading to potentially dangerous actions. DSC-MATE-4857's skin shows distinctive spots, and they have an unnaturally bright, almost glowing smile. Their eyes are orange, and their eyebrows are unusually long and pointed. DSC-MATE-4857 prefers to wear a bucket hat in public, with goggles resting on their forehead. A green cross earring adorns their left ear, with a thick gold chain around their neck as their accessory. 

DSC-MATE-4857's most notable feature is their willingness to take impulsive risks. This behavior has resulted in several humorous situations, such as jumping off a cliff into a lake or river without hesitation, and once breaking into song mid-broadcast. DSC-MATE-4857 is otherwise compliant with the routine regulations of their news anchor job and has shown no inclination towards harming others, making them a mild anomaly despite their strange behavior. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4857's anomalous properties were first discovered during an on-air remote segment on 07/██/20██ live from a local cliff jumping location. After a televised exchange between DSC-MATE-4857 and Field Reporter ███████, DSC-MATE-4857 impulsively jumped off a 60ft cliff into the lake behind them without any safety equipment. Field Reporter ███████ alerted local Emergency Services, who arrived minutes later to find DSC-MATE-4857 standing on the shore, unhurt and surprised by the reaction. DSC-MATE-4857's anomalous properties were then discovered and contained by Foundation personnel, and they were subsequently introduced to the Foundation's paranormal containment program.
