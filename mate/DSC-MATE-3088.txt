Item #: SCP-3088

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3088 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to books, documentaries, and educational materials must be provided upon request. SCP-3088's choker must remain on at all times.

Description: SCP-3088 appears to be a female human farmer with distinctive spots on her face and a smile that rarely fades. She has green hair that is often styled in a braid and wears a purple cap over it. Her choker is an intricate design made of silver and emerald.

SCP-3088 displays a remarkable thirst for knowledge and is often seen reading or researching obscure topics that are not related to farming. Her passion for learning extends to collecting books, documentaries, and educational materials that she eagerly shares with others. She can be quite persuasive in her arguments and is always trying to increase her understanding of the world around her.

SCP-3088's behavior is mostly benign, but it is advised that caution be exercised when discussing certain sensitive topics, as her passionate nature may lead her to become confrontational. 

SCP-3088 has shown no signs of anomalous properties, but extensive screening and regular monitoring should continue to ensure the safety of all personnel involved in her containment. 

Addendum: SCP-3088 has expressed interest in assisting with agricultural research within the Foundation, and her knowledge of farming has proven to be a valuable resource. Her request to be involved in such research has been approved under careful supervision.
