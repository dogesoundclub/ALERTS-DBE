She wears a medical mask on her mouth and a gold earring in each ear, as well as a silver chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-4432 is a self-proclaimed programmer with a scattered personality. While she possesses a high level of technical skill, she is often forgetful and easily distracted, leading to humorous situations. Foundation personnel have observed DSC-MATE-4432 losing track of important deadlines and getting lost while attempting to navigate unfamiliar areas.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4432 was brought to Foundation attention following reports of her hacking into various government agencies and corporations. Upon capture, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-4432 had no malicious intent and was simply testing her own skills. She has since been cooperative in sharing her knowledge with Foundation researchers.
