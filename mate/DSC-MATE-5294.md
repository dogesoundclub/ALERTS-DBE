Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5294 is to be held in a specially designed containment cell at Site-██. Due to DSC-MATE-5294's humanoid form, the cell has been designed to resemble a basic police station, complete with a desk, chairs, and a booking room. Cell cameras are to be monitored 24/7 by trained personnel to ensure DSC-MATE-5294 does not attempt to escape.

DSC-MATE-5294 is to be fed a daily diet of raw meat and water, and is allowed one hour of exercise time per day within a designated area in the containment cell. Personnel are advised not to approach DSC-MATE-5294 during this time.

Description: DSC-MATE-5294 is a male Bengal tiger, standing at a height of 6 feet at the shoulder. DSC-MATE-5294 wears a police cap on its head and a set of goggles on its forehead, as well as a gold earring and chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-5294 has a frightened expression on its mouth, but its eyes are currently unknown, as DSC-MATE-5294 refuses to remove or lift its goggles.

Notably, DSC-MATE-5294 has taken on the career of a traffic officer, displaying an eagerness to ticket and fine any pedestrians or vehicles that infringe on traffic rules. This has led to several close calls and incidents with DSC-MATE-5294 and the public, necessitating its containment.

DSC-MATE-5294 displays a dry sense of humor, often catching personnel off guard with its deadpan delivery of jokes. It appears to enjoy being in a position of authority and can be quite intimidating while handling traffic.
