SCP Foundation Description:

Subject 256, also known as "The Firefighter", is a Human of unknown origin and with a disturbing appearance. Her eyes appear to be those of a clown's, with a bright red color that keeps an unsettling watch on everything around her. On her forehead, there is a strange two-color band that seems to be part of her anatomy, possibly an external growth. Her ears, meanwhile, are decorated with red cross earrings that suggest some kind of religious affiliation.

The Firefighter always wears a medical mask that covers her mouth at all times. What lies behind the mask remains a mystery to this day as no one has ever seen her face. It is not clear why she does this, but it may be due to an aversion to germs or as a form of personal protection.

Subject 256 has a peculiar sense of intuition which some could describe as psychic. She often seems to know what is going to happen before it does, and she can detect when others are upset or anxious. This ability is both impressive and unsettling as it gives her an air of authority that can make others uncomfortable around her.

The Firefighter is a promising addition to our organization. She possesses exceptional physical abilities that are essential in any firefighting operation. Her sense of intuition and psychic-like powers could also prove useful in future investigations. However, we recommend caution when dealing with Subject 256 as her appearance and abilities may unnerve those around her.
