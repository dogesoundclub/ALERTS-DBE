Item #: 5872

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5872 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to any and all gift-giving occasions is to be limited and supervised by at least two (2) personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. SCP-5872 is allowed to work on machinery in the containment chamber as long as it does not interfere with its assigned duties.

Description: SCP-5872 is a humanoid creature identified as a human male with orange stripes on its face and a permanent smile. Its eyes are replaced with VR Jade LED, which glows and flickers as it communicates. Its head is made of an unknown metal with a purple coloration. SCP-5872 also wears a gold chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-5872's personality is highly observant and attentive to details, making it an excellent gift-giver. It possesses an almost obsessive need to give the "perfect" gift and can spend extensive amounts of time agonizing over what to get someone. This personality trait has been observed to cause SCP-5872 significant levels of stress and anxiety in the past.

SCP-5872's primary function is that of a mechanic, performing repairs and maintenance on various machinery and equipment as needed. It has shown a remarkable level of proficiency in mechanical engineering, which complemented by its attention to detail and observant nature, has led to its successful completion of several projects.

Addendum: SCP-5872 was recovered and brought into Foundation containment following multiple reports of unusual gifts appearing during various gift-giving occasions in the general public. The Foundation was alerted to the possibility of SCP involvement due to the extraordinary nature of the gifts and the level of obsessive attention to detail involved in their creation.

SCP-5872 demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel, thus resulting in its designation as a Safe class SCP. It has since received job placement as a mechanic at Site ██, where its skills are utilized in maintaining the site's machinery and equipment.
