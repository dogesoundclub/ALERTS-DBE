Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7938 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and is not to venture outside of the designated live/work space.

Description: Subject 7938 is a human male of average height and build, with bright orange tiger stripes on his cheeks. The subject constantly wears a retro cap with a 2-color band on his forehead. Additionally, subject always wears a gas mask, which is normal in all other respects except the unmistakable smell of ozone that persists in it. Subject has demonstrated an uncanny sense of intuition, and may be able to predict events before they occur. The source of this ability remains unknown. Although friendly and often jovial, subject can come across as eerie due to his apparent psychic abilities.

Personality: Subject 7938 is known for their extremely strong intuition and ability to sense othersâ€™ emotions. Some have reported strange occurrences in their presence, such as objects moving on their own accord, and rumors of precognition. Due to these unusual abilities, it is strongly advised not to engage in frivolous communication with the subject. It is also strongly recommended by Foundation personnel to monitor their own emotional states when in the presence of the subject, as their uncanny intuition may identify weaknesses in the individual's mental and emotional states.

Addendum: It is not recommended to engage in extended conversation with the subject. Due to the ability of the subject to cause changes in the environment, it is better to keep communication to a minimum unless it is essential to their containment.
