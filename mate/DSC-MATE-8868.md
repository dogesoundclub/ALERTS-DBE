Item #: 8868

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the elusive nature of Subject 8868, standard containment measures have been rendered ineffective. As such, a task force with specialized knowledge in urban tracking and mafia operations has been established to monitor and track Subject 8868's movements.

Description: Subject 8868 is a human male believed to be in his mid-thirties. He sports a charming smile that is often used to disarm and manipulate unsuspecting individuals. His eyes are obscured by ski goggles, and a jade earring adorns his left ear. A medical mask is often worn over his mouth, making identification through facial recognition challenging at best.

Personality: Subject 8868 exhibits a unique preference for knowledge acquisition. He is often found reading, researching, or collecting books on various obscure topics. Additionally, he is passionate about sharing his newfound knowledge with others. This trait, combined with his ruthless mafia boss status, creates a volatile mix of intelligence and brutality.
