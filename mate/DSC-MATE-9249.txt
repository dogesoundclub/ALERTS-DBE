Item #: 9249

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9249 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents. It has been disguised as a normal human and placed in the guise of a real estate agent. Item 9249 is unaware of its anomalous qualities, and as such, it is encouraged to believe that it is living a normal life, blissfully ignorant of the dangers that its presence poses to the mundane world.

Description: Item 9249 is a female human with orange stripes covering her body. She wears a retro cap on her head, with a two-color band across her forehead. Her red cross earrings are notable, as is the choker she wears around her neck. Item 9249 often carries a cigarette in hand, which adds to her reckless demeanor.

Personality: Item 9249 is known to act before thinking things through, often leading to amusing but potentially dangerous situations. It seems to enjoy showing off and impressing others, despite the risks that doing so entails. Its reckless nature is often played off as jovial and humorous, but its potential for danger cannot be ignored.

Addendum: Item 9249 was discovered in the field during a routine investigation of anomalous behavior. It is yet unknown how it acquired its anomalous properties, but it has been instructed to keep from revealing them to others, as they may endanger both itself and innocent civilians. Its placement as a real estate agent allows for easy surveillance and monitoring by Foundation agents.
