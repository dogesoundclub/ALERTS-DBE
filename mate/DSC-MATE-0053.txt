Item #: SCP-53

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-53 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-53 is granted only to Level 3 personnel or above, and any communication from SCP-53 must be monitored and recorded for review.

Description: SCP-53 is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Her eyebrows are bright orange and she wears a pair of goggles on her forehead. SCP-53 also has jade earrings and a gold chain around her neck. Her mouth is covered by a medical mask.

SCP-53 works as a reporter for a local news outlet, but she has a tendency to act before she thinks things through. This reckless behavior has resulted in several minor accidents and mishaps. Despite this, SCP-53 is well-liked by her coworkers and often tries to impress or show off to them.

SCP-53's behavior is not believed to be influenced by any anomalous properties, and her abilities are consistent with a typical human. However, her recklessness and tendency to show off make it difficult to predict her actions and ensure her safety.

Addendum: SCP-53 was brought to the Foundation's attention after several witnesses reported seeing her survive an otherwise fatal car accident without injury. SCP-53 has since been identified as a potential anomalous entity, and further study is ongoing.
