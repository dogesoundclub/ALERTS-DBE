Item #: 8521

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8521 is to be confined to a specially designed holding cell with a reinforced steel wall, ceiling, and floor. All electrical wiring in the room must be checked daily for any signs of tampering, and any anomalies should be reported to the research team immediately. Subject 8521 is to be fed a diet of raw meat twice daily, and all interactions with the subject must be conducted through a two-way mirror or remote communication systems. Under no circumstances should any personnel enter the containment cell with subject 8521.

Description: Subject 8521 appears to be a male tiger, standing approximately 6 feet tall and weighing around 400 pounds. The subject's fur is a reddish-orange color, and it has a blue bandana tied around its head. The subject's mouth is constantly in a frightened state, with its VR jade LED eyes glowing dimly in the dark. The subject's ears are pierced with jade earrings, and it wears a silver chain around its neck. The subject is often seen carrying a whistle, which it uses to communicate with its handlers.

Subject 8521 is an electrician by trade and possesses an unusually high level of intelligence and aptitude when it comes to manipulating electricity. Its abilities are well-documented, and the subject is able to control and manipulate electricity in ways that defy conventional understanding. This has led to numerous incidents of electrical failure and outages in various areas where the subject has been employed.

However, subject 8521 is not without its quirks. It tends to spend a lot of time lost in thought and can be prone to daydreaming or becoming distracted easily. This has led to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

Personality: Subject 8521 tends to be very introspective and can be difficult to read. It has a quiet, reserved demeanor and may not be very forthcoming with information or opinions. However, the subject has shown a protective and loyal streak towards those it considers its allies. Its interactions with humans are generally cautious and hesitant, but it has been known to warm up to those who show it kindness.

Addendum: Research has shown that subject 8521 possesses an anomalous ability to store vast amounts of electrical energy within its body. While it is unknown how the subject generates this energy, it is hypothesized that it is somehow able to convert organic matter into electrical energy. Further study is required to determine the exact mechanisms behind this ability.
