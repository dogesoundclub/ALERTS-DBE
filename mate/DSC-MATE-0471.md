He is often observed with a candy stick in his mouth and a smile on his face. DSC-MATE-471 responds positively to social interactions and values harmony in his environment. However, his desire to be humorous has led to playful banter which can sometimes be inappropriate.

DSC-MATE-471 used to work as a programmer, and his expertise in the field makes him a significant threat. DSC-MATE-471 has an intimate knowledge of several programming languages, and his close association with multiple hacktivist groups makes him dangerous. It has been noticed that he tends to use candy sticks in stressful situations as a coping mechanism.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-471 shows a keen interest in DSC-999 and often requests to spend time with the entity, claiming it has a calming effect on him. The nature of this connection warrants further investigation.
