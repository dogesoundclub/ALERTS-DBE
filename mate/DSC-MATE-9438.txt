Item #: 9438

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9438 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No special procedures are necessary for containment. Any attempts to communicate with SCP-9438 should be carried out through a translator, as SCP-9438 seems to struggle with verbal communication.

Description: SCP-9438 appears to be a young human male in his mid-20s who works as a beautician. They are approximately 183cm tall and weigh approximately 81kg. SCP-9438's most noticeable facial features are the "Mouth Spot" on their right cheek and their permanent smile. SCP-9438's eyes resemble ski goggles, and they often sport a short peak cap on their head. SCP-9438 can usually be seen with goggles resting on their forehead, and they wear a green cross earring in their left ear. 

SCP-9438's mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and they often wear a gold chain around their neck. SCP-9438's personality has been noted to be very observant and attentive to details, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-9438 can also become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-9438 was discovered by a local police officer after they had been reported to be behaving erratically in a store. After being taken into custody, it was discovered that SCP-9438 had been using their gift-giving abilities to manipulate people into giving them things that they wanted. SCP-9438 was later identified as an anomaly and brought into Foundation custody.

SCP-9438 seems to be unaware of their anomalous abilities and has no memory of using them to manipulate anyone. SCP-9438 has stated that they enjoy making people feel happy and that they take pride in their work as a beautician. SCP-9438 has been cooperative with the Foundation and has expressed a desire to learn more about their abilities. Research into SCP-9438's anomalous abilities is ongoing.
