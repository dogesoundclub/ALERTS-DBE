Item #: 5955

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5955 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must include a feeding station adapted for the dietary needs of a monkey, as well as several toys and puzzles to keep 5955 occupied. 5955 must not be allowed to make personal contact with any staff or other DSC entities. The sale of any vehicles by 5955 must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: 5955 appears as a male monkey with red clown eyes and a frightful mouth. His head is adorned with a police cap, and he wears an oversized gold chain and a cigarette. Despite being a primate, 5955 has exhibited proficiency in car salesmanship, and has been known to sell vehicles of varying makes and models to unsuspecting customers. 
Investigation has revealed that 5955 possesses a creative and artistic side, which he may express through different hobbies such as painting, drawing, and writing.

Personality: Though initially timid and easily frightened, 5955 is highly sociable and enjoys engaging with staff and visitors when permitted. 5955 often showcases his artistic abilities through drawings he makes on available materials within his containment area. 5955 has also shown a level of cunning not typically seen in primates of his species- using his artistic talents to create convincing forgeries of important documents such as licenses and transfer papers in order to sell cars he has acquired through less-than-legal means. 

Addendum: On 10/██/20██ 5955 showcased an unexpected ability to remove himself from his containment chamber. After uncovering tampering to the lock mechanism on his door, it was discovered that this ability centered around 5955's knowledge and manipulation of puzzles and locks. The security of his chamber has since been upgraded to ensure such events do not recur. 

DSC-MATE-5955 continues to be monitored by Site-██ staff.
