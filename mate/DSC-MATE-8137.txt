Item #: SCP-8137

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8137 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Physical contact with SCP-8137 is not permitted without prior approval from Level 4 personnel. Any personnel found to have been exposed to SCP-8137's humorous antics are to be monitored for signs of mental and emotional instability. 

Description: SCP-8137 appears to be a male tiger standing at approximately 2 meters tall. SCP-8137 possesses an unknown type of eyes, which are always covered by medical masks. SCP-8137 is typically seen wearing a bucket hat and sporting a goggle on his forehead. SCP-8137 is also known to don a silver chain around his neck. 

SCP-8137 displays an extraordinary sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. However, this tendency has the potential to subvert the professionalism and focus of Foundation personnel. It is important to be cautious when interacting with SCP-8137, as its humor and antics can cause distractions and may undermine ongoing Foundation operations. 

Addendum: Recently, SCP-8137 was observed telling a series of jokes to a group of personnel, with effects ranging from disarming targeted individuals to causing extensive laughter that persisted for hours. SCP-8137's ability to induce positive emotional states in personnel could potentially be further investigated for pacification of hostile targets. However, due to SCP-8137's unpredictable nature, testing is currently on hold.
