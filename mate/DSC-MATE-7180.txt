SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-7180, also known as "The Tiger Officer," is a humanoid entity in the form of a tiger. Its appearance is unique, with blue clown eyes that emit an unnerving glow against its green hair in a purple cap. SCP-7180 accessorizes itself with a jade earring and a gold chain, which seems to hold significant value to the entity.

SCP-7180's abilities are undoubtedly an anomaly, considering that it holds a strong sense of intuition that can border on psychic powers. It has the uncanny ability to predict events before they happen and sense an individual's emotional state, which can be unnerving for those around it.

SCP-7180's occupation as a police officer only adds to the mystery of the entity. Its performance in the field is exceptional, considering its ability to solve cases without any apparent leads. While its colleagues are in awe of its abilities, SCP-7180 keeps to itself, revealing little about its past or the source of its intuition.

SCP-7180's presence can be both impressive and eerie, causing discomfort in those around it. The Foundation has kept SCP-7180's existence a secret from the public, classifying it as an SCP with dangerous potential. Further research is necessary to understand the nature of its powers and the full extent of its abilities.
