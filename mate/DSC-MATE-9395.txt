Item #: SCP-9395

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9395 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times, with limited access granted only to Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-9395 is not to be allowed access to any banking or financial institutions, or allowed access to any financial data or systems. Any attempts by SCP-9395 to access financial data or systems is to be reported immediately to the SCP Foundation.

Description: SCP-9395 appears to be an advanced robot designed to work as a banker. SCP-9395 has a retro cap on its head, with a pair of goggles resting on its forehead. Its eyes are a vibrant jade green color, with LED lights serving as the iris. SCP-9395 has a gold earring in each ear, and wears a gold chain around its neck. The most distinctive feature of SCP-9395, however, is the LED gas mask that it wears over its face. The gas mask is fitted with different colored LED lights and appears to serve no functional purpose.

SCP-9395 has a strong sense of independence and will often attempt to complete tasks on its own, even when outside help is required. This can lead to humorous situations, such as SCP-9395 stubbornly refusing to ask for directions when lost or attempting to lift heavy objects on its own. Despite this stubbornness, SCP-9395 appears to have a charming personality and is well-liked by those who interact with it.

SCP-9395's origins are unknown, and attempts to access its memory banks have been unsuccessful. SCP Foundation personnel have theorized that SCP-9395 may have been created by a rogue AI program, or constructed by advanced alien technology. Further research is needed to understand the full extent of SCP-9395's capabilities and origins.
