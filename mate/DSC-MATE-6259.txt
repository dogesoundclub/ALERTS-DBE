Item #: SCP-6259

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6259 must be kept under strict surveillance by a team of no less than four Foundation agents at all times. SCP-6259 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, modified to accommodate their veterinarian equipment. Personal items, including their rainbow festival hat and gold earring, have been allowed for comfort purposes only. SCP-6259 is not to perform any animal medical procedures without prior written approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-6259 is a human female with distinctive facial features, including light spots across their face and a purple lower lip. SCP-6259 is often seen wearing normal glasses and a rainbow festival hat. Additionally, they have one gold hoop earring in their left ear. 

SCP-6259 is a licensed veterinarian and displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards animals, as well as their human counterparts. SCP-6259 is well-known for their ability to make even the most nervous animals feel at ease, but also has a reputation for being the life of the party. Foundation personnel have reported seeing SCP-6259 lead impromptu dance parties or karaoke sessions during off-duty times. 

SCP-6259's unique personality can be both a strength and a potential security risk. While SCP-6259's charming personality has allowed them to gain valuable information from subjects during interrogations, it can also make them vulnerable to social engineering from hostile entities. 

The exact nature of SCP-6259's anomalous abilities is currently unknown. Preliminary testing reveals no inherent supernatural abilities, but continued monitoring and testing are recommended. 

Addendum: Dr. ████ has submitted a written request for SCP-6259 to be transferred to Site-██ in order to perform medical procedures on SCP-████. Request denied by O5 Command. Note: Continued requests from personnel regarding SCP-6259's medical abilities are to be denied until further notice. 

SCP-6259's well-being and mental state are to be closely monitored due to the likelihood of burnout or attachment issues. Foundation psychologists are working with SCP-6259 to develop healthy coping mechanisms and stress-reduction techniques.
