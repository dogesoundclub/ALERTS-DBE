Item #: 2615

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2615 is to be closely monitored and tracked by Foundation agents disguised as colleagues. Any unusual behavior or activity is to be immediately reported. Subject 2615 is to be kept away from any knowledge of the anomalous, as well as any high-stress situations that may compromise their mental state.

Description: Subject 2615 is a male human with a distinctive mouth spot and a friendly smile. Their eyes are covered by normal glasses while a police cap partially obscures their forehead's 2 color band. Subject 2615 wears a jade earring on their left ear. They work as a banker by day, but their analytical mind and quirky sense of humor make them stand out amongst their peers.

Subject 2615 has shown no signs of any anomalous abilities or associations, and is believed to be a regular human. However, their personality may make them a potential target for manipulation by paranormal entities seeking to exploit their dry, deadpan wit.

It is recommended that any exposure to the anomalous be kept to a minimum, as Subject 2615 may be a liability if their analytical skills are used to discern any hidden anomalies. Good relations between Subject 2615 and Foundation personnel are encouraged to maintain a friendly and cooperative demeanor towards the Foundation's efforts at secrecy.

Addendum: Recent reports suggest that Subject 2615 may have become aware of the Foundation's interests. Interrogation and possible administration of Class-A amnestics are recommended to prevent further breaches of secrecy.
