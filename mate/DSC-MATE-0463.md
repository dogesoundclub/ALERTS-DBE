Description: DSC-MATE-463 is a human male of approximately 30 years of age. He stands at an average height of 175cm, with a lean build and short, spiky hair styled carefully with gel. Two distinct facial features set DSC-MATE-463 apart from a typical human. He has a pattern of black and white spots scattered across his skin, giving him a distinctive appearance. Additionally, his mouth is almost always open in a state of extreme anxiety. DSC-MATE-463 compensates for the appearance with oversized nerd glasses.

DSC-MATE-463 presents a personality that can be quite domineering and authoritative. Driven by an insatiable curiosity and an unquenchable desire for the truth, DSC-MATE-463 uses his profession as an investigative journalist to uncover the secrets of the unknown. He is often seen sporting some form of a gold chain, which he claims is his good luck charm, and an oversized Gold Earring that serves as his microphone.

DSC-MATE-463 seems unaware of his distinctive appearance and prefers to use it to his advantage to blend seamlessly in any crowd he is investigating. Should he decide that a particular mystery is worth pursuing, he will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of it. This tenacity, combined with a knack for research and public speaking, makes DSC-MATE-463 a valuable asset to the Foundation's operation.
