Item #: 4990

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4990 is to be allowed to continue their mundane job as a delivery driver. Due to the nature of their abilities, SCP-4990 is to be monitored for any potential breaches of secrecy or any displays of anomalous activity. SCP-4990 is permitted to utilize their normal gas mask at all times while out in public.

Description: SCP-4990 is a male rabbit with a distinct appearance. Their head is typically covered by a bucket hat with their ears adorned with a jade earring. SCP-4990 is often seen wearing a normal gas mask, but it is unknown if it serves any actual purpose. Their personality is notable due to their incredibly strong sense of intuition, which can border on appearing supernatural. SCP-4990 is known to predict events before they happen or sense the moods and feelings of others.

Despite their unusual abilities, SCP-4990 maintains a relatively mundane life as a regular delivery driver. However, it is important to note that SCP-4990's intuition may potentially pose a security risk if they were to come into contact with individuals of interest or those with knowledge of the Foundation.

Addendum: Further testing and observation of SCP-4990's abilities may give insight into their anomalous nature and the potential for containment and utilization. For now, SCP-4990 is to be monitored for any changes or developments in their abilities or behavior.
