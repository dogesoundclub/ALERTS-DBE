SCP-1659, also known as "The Lawyer," is a humanoid creature with a distinguishable spotted complexion and characteristic smile. Their eyes are concealable with ordinary glasses, but pay no attention to their normalcy. The subject's head is asymmetrical, with one side covered in orange hair, while the other side is bald. Notably, the creature's forehead bears a distinctive two-color band. Additionally, the subject sports cross-shaped green earrings and a choker. When in public, they wear a gas mask, which is presumed to be an accessory.

SCP-1659's behavior suggests a natural talent for leadership that they often exhibit in professional and personal settings. Regardless of the situation, The Lawyer is quick to take charge and make decisions. While it is unclear if this behavior is due to their species or if it is a psychological trait, it should not be underestimated. Interactions with SCP-1659 must be monitored cautiously, as they may have intentions of manipulating their circumstances to their benefit.
