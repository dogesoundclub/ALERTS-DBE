Item #: 2249

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 2249 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to her occupation as a beautician, she is allowed access to beauty and grooming supplies as deemed necessary by site personnel.

Description: 2249 appears to be a humanoid female of average height and weight with spots on her face as her distinguishable feature. Her facial expressions all bear a smile, further enhancing her congenial disposition. Her eyes have been replaced with Jade LED lenses resembling augmented reality technology, allowing her to visually alter the world around her. Her head resembles that of a 00s schoolgirl, complete with a goggle resting upon her forehead. Both of her ears have jade jewelry in the form of earrings. She is regularly seen wearing a medical mask over her mouth for reasons unknown.

Personality: 2249 is a highly organized individual who enjoys planning ahead, yet is not afraid to pursue spontaneous adventures and experiences. She is renowned for her sense of humor and her ability to surprise her friends with impromptu events or last-minute party planning. Her disposition is generally friendly and upbeat, but her mood can shift if anyone dismisses her plans or routines. She has shown to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, though at times, she can become overly enthusiastic in sharing her hobbies and ideas.

Addendum: 2249 has expressed interest in providing her beautician services to Foundation personnel. Pending approval by site personnel, her services will be made available upon request.
