Item #: SCP-9132

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9132 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Communication with SCP-9132 should be limited to approved personnel only. Any attempt to exit their containment chamber without permission must result in immediate termination. Any information disseminated by SCP-9132 must be reviewed by Foundation personnel for potential memetic, cognitohazardous, or otherwise harmful content.

Description: SCP-9132 is a female humanoid with distinct physical features, including bright red lips, VR jade LED eyes, and green hair with an edge curl. They also bear a red cross earring and a pair of goggles on their forehead. SCP-9132 typically carries a cigarette as an accessory.

SCP-9132 identifies as a human and holds the occupation of a reporter. Their personality suggests a no-nonsense attitude, often valuing traditional approaches to problem-solving. SCP-9132 also possesses a playful side, which can manifest in humorous anecdotes or stories passed down from their family and community.

SCP-9132's anomalous properties are not immediately apparent, but their memetic potential is a concern. Interviews with SCP-9132 have been known to have long-term effects on the interviewer's cognitive patterns. As such, all interactions with SCP-9132 must be approved, monitored, and documented.

Addendum: SCP-9132 was first encountered during an investigation into a series of anomalous news reports. Upon tracking the source of the reports, Foundation agents found SCP-9132, who appeared to be the sole author of the articles. Following containment, SCP-9132 has been cooperative and forthcoming in providing information about their involvement in the dissemination of anomalous information to the public. As such, SCP-9132 has been deemed a valuable resource for investigating and containing information breaches.
