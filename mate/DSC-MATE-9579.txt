Item #: 9579

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject should be monitored and reviewed regularly for any behavior that may endanger herself or others in her line of work. She should be kept under surveillance when she is within the confines of the bank or any other financial institutions. Any attempt at unauthorized rule-breaking or subversive activity should be immediately reported to the Foundation.

Description: SCP-9579 is a human female banker who displays a unique set of physical characteristics. She has orange stripes on her face, alongside a smile that seems to be ever-present. Her eyes, which are bright blue and clown-like, seem to give off an unnerving feeling when observed. The subject's head appears to have the appearance of a pink rabbit, with a distinctive two-color band running across the forehead. She wears a red cross earring on each ear, and her mouth is always obstructed by a medical mask. The subject is also noted to have a gold chain around her neck as an accessory.

Personality: SCP-9579 has demonstrated a rebellious streak within her personality, consistently pushing boundaries and defying authority. This behavior often leads to unpredictable situations and activities, including breaking rules and finding ways to bend them just to see what happens. Despite this, the subject is generally cooperative when placed under surveillance and has displayed a willingness to comply with the Foundation's requests.

Addendum: SCP-9579 was initially discovered by Foundation agents when an informant reported unusual activities involving abnormal physical characteristics. Following initial observation, the object's physical appearance and behavioral traits were confirmed, leading to its classification. The object remains under the supervision of the Foundation while maintaining her current banking job to support her finances.
