Item #: DSC-MATE-2110

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2110 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with basic amenities for a primate, including a bed, books, and toys. It is not to be allowed access to any electronic devices or the internet, as its deep curiosity can lead to dangerous experimentation. DSC-MATE-2110's enclosure is to be monitored at all times, and any unusual behavior or activity is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-2110 is a male primate of the species Macaca mulatta, commonly known as the rhesus monkey. It exhibits some unusual characteristics, including blue clown eyes, parted pink hair on the head, and a jade earring in each ear. DSC-MATE-2110 shows an insatiable curiosity about the world around it, often engaging in random and sometimes bizarre behavior as a means of exploring its environment.

DSC-MATE-2110 has been observed spouting off obscure facts and trivia to others, often causing humor and amusement among those present. However, this trait can also lead to dangerous experimentation or exploration, which the Foundation seeks to prevent at all costs. DSC-MATE-2110 is also known to exhibit bursts of extreme aggression when frustrated, especially when denied access to new information or experiences.

DSC-MATE-2110 was first discovered by Foundation agents operating undercover in a theater in downtown [REDACTED], where it had been appointed as the theater manager. It is believed that DSC-MATE-2110 had somehow gained access to the position using its unusual abilities, although how it managed to do so remains unclear.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-2110's unusual nature, several tests and experiments have been conducted to better understand its behavior and abilities. While it appears to have some level of cognitive ability and reasoning skills, further research is needed to determine the full extent of its capabilities. A team of researchers has been authorized to study DSC-MATE-2110 further, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of its species and unique abilities.
