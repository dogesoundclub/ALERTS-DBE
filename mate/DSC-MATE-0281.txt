Item #: SCP-281

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-281 is to be monitored at all times by undercover Foundation agents in order to ensure public safety. SCP-281 is not to be allowed contact with non-Foundation personnel unless approved by Level 4 personnel.

SCP-281 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. SCP-281 is permitted a personal radio communication device and all necessary items for daily living.

Description: SCP-281 is a human female of average height and weight. They have short, witch-like hair, and distinctive orange stripes on their face. SCP-281 typically wears a LED gas mask, which covers their eyes and mouth. During containment, SCP-281 was discovered wearing a silver chain and gold earrings.

SCP-281 is known for their ability to connect with others on a deep level. They possess a remarkable charisma that can easily engender trust and intimacy in others. SCP-281 utilizes this ability to great effect in their job as a delivery driver, often sharing humorous anecdotes and eliciting stories of a personal nature from strangers.

SCP-281 has two distinctive features on their forehead: a two-color band and goggles. These features remain unexplained, as they have not changed in any observable way since initial contact.

Addendum: SCP-281's ability to engender trust has led to a number of containment breaches, as SCP-281 has been known to utilize their abilities to convince individuals to facilitate escape or release from Foundation custody. Thus, all interaction with SCP-281 must be conducted with the utmost caution.
