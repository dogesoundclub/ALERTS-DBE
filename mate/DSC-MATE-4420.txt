SCP-4420 has a head made out of a metal blue material and wears a red cross earring on each ear. They also wear a gold chain around their neck and an LED gas mask over their mouth area.

SCP-4420 possesses empathy and deep understanding for others. However, they tend to show extreme emotional outbursts, particularly when exposed to situations where someone is experiencing pain or suffering. SCP-4420 has displayed a sentimental attachment towards animals and nature, often expressing an intense emotional response to their well-being.

SCP-4420 was brought to Foundation attention after several reports of animal mutilation in the area she resided in. Further investigation of the area led to the discovery of a large underground bunker where SCP-4420 engaged in a ritualistic practice involving the sacrifice of various animals.

SCP-4420 was taken into Foundation custody and received mandatory psychological evaluations, indicating that SCP-4420 has multiple personality disorders.

Addendum 4420-A: During one of the Foundation’s routine inspections, it was discovered that SCP-4420 had manifested a new Personality, which called herself “Nature’s Protector.” The new personality assumes control of SCP-4420’s body whenever the latter is faced with a situation that presents a potential threat to nature or the environment.

Addendum 4420-B: Upon further investigation, it was discovered that SCP-4420’s metal head, when removed from its body, is capable of controlling electronic equipment, including computer software and hardware. SCP-4420 is not yet aware of its head’s capabilities, and further testing is ongoing.
