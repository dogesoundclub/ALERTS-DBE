Item #: SCP-29

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-29 is to be kept in a designated containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-29 is strictly forbidden without Level 3 or higher clearance. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-29 must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including but not limited to a standard gas mask.

Description: SCP-29 is a human female with abnormal head features, noted to have green hair that is not styled in any particular manner. SCP-29 is often observed wearing a pair of goggles on their forehead and a gas mask, with no notable damage or abnormalities. Despite this, SCP-29's personality is noted to have a tendency to be highly practical and hands-on. When presented with a problem, SCP-29 will often fix objects in unconventional ways, using duct tape or paper clips as makeshift solutions.

SCP-29 has shown to have a highly analytical mind, utilizing a wide array of skills in programming and problem-solving. Interviews with SCP-29 have shown that they have a deep understanding of complex systems and are highly adaptable to different technological environments. Despite SCP-29's obvious skills, they can display poor judgment when presented with problematic social situations.

SCP-29 was recovered following several reports of inexplicable incidents concerning a highly advanced computer system at a local tech company. The company reported odd fluctuations in the system's behavior and cybersecurity measures being breached without any apparent cause. After investigation, SCP-29 was identified as the culprit and subsequently brought into Foundation custody.

Addendum: While SCP-29 shows no signs of anomalous abilities, their highly capable abilities in programming and problem-solving are highly valuable to the Foundation. As such, SCP-29's containment should prioritize their continued physical and mental well-being in order to benefit the greater good. Any attempts to use SCP-29 for personal gain will not be tolerated.
