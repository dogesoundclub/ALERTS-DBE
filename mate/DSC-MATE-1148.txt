SCP Foundation Personnel File: 
Identification Number: SCP-1148
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1148 is to be kept under a 24-hour surveillance in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. Due to his unique abilities to connect with others at a personal level, SCP-1148 is not to be allowed any communication with anyone outside of the Foundation under any circumstances including interviews, press or public appearances. All who come in contact with SCP-1148 must wear earplugs to prevent the influence of his contagious personality.

Description: SCP-1148 is a male human, appearing to be in his mid-30s with a charismatic personality. SCP-1148 is a Firefighter and is frequently seen around his containment unit dressed in a Hoodie with orange stripes on his face. He wears normal glasses over his Orange Striped eyes, which have been tested and show no anomalous features. 

Despite SCP-1148's seemingly normal appearance, it possesses an anomalous personality. SCP-1148 can connect with individuals on a deep emotional level, regardless of what they believe or where they come from. SCP-1148's abilities lead to broader access to information and people's memories which further increase his contagious and charismatic behaviour. SCP-1148's abilities, while seemingly benign, pose a severe security risk as it can easily win the trust of any individual, Foundation or otherwise, without any effort.

Addendum: On several occasions, SCP-1148 was caught smoking a cigarette while interacting with other humanoid SCPs in Site-██. Although this appears to contradict standard containment protocols in the Foundation, it was allowed due to SCP-1148's non-violent nature and its ability to maintain his emotional balance even in high-stress situations. However, additional guidelines were put in place to regulate SCP-1148's smoking habits.
