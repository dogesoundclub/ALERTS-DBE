Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8552 is to be contained within a separate room located within the Foundation's site. The room is to be equipped with standard amenities, and subject 8552 is allowed to maintain her identity and perform her duties as a theater manager.

The subject is allowed to wear her trademark orange stripes dress and wear a tiara on her head at all times. Accessory #1, a gold choker, is allowed, but Accessory #2, an LED gas mask, is to be removed at all times unless for research purposes. Subject 8552 is to be monitored at all times and any anomalous behavior must be reported immediately.

Description: Subject 8552 is a human female with an unusual appearance. Her face features distinctive orange stripes, and she wears normal glasses over her hazel eyes. A tiara decorates her head, and she has one gold earring on each ear. She wears a choker around her neck, and when she needs to use it, an LED gas mask obscures her face.

Subject 8552 has a no-nonsense attitude but also exhibits a playful side. She values her traditions and upbringing and is known to tell jokes and stories that have been passed down through her family and community, often leading to humorous situations.

Research has shown that subject 8552 has an anomalous ability to manipulate reality through her storytelling. When she tells a traditional story, the setting and characters come to life, often with unexpected consequences. As such, subject 8552 is considered highly dangerous and must be kept under close observation at all times.

Notes: Subject 8552's anomalous ability has caused several containment breaches in the past. She has been involved in incidents where creatures from traditional folklore came to life, causing chaos and endangering human lives. As such, all interactions with subject 8552 must be kept to a minimum, and any requests for stories or folklore tales must be approved by Level 4 personnel.
