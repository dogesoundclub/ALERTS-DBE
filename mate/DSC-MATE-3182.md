Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3182 is to be monitored at all times by personnel wearing level 2 biohazard suits equipped with oxygen tanks. Due to its unpredictable behavior, it must be housed in a soundproof cell lined with metal and containing no electronic devices. DSC-MATE-3182 is not to be exposed to any form of media including newspapers or social media sites, as it has been known to cause behavioral changes within DSC-MATE-3182.

Description: DSC-MATE-3182 is a human female, currently employed as a news anchor. DSC-MATE-3182 exhibits highly unusual behavior, marked by extreme enthusiasm and energy. Its personality often infects those around it, leading to frenzied excitement that can sometimes jeopardize the safety of others. It has been observed to be highly communicative and engages in constant chatter. DSC-MATE-3182 wears a normal gas mask as its exposure to media has been known to cause sudden and uncontrollable outbursts.

DSC-MATE-3182 wears a purple cap with a headset on its head, behind normal glasses used to enhance its vision. It has been known to use its headset to communicate with voice actors and sound designers, claiming it "boosts its morale." Research is currently underway to determine the reason for this particular behavior.

DSC-MATE-3182's enthusiasm for news broadcasting is highly infectious, with many viewers becoming highly engaged in its presentations. However, its unpredictable behavior and highly energetic states often interfere with its ability to report the news in a factual, unbiased manner.

Addendum: Exposure to DSC-MATE-3182 must be limited in any way possible, as it has been known to infect those around it with its hyperactivity and borderline manic enthusiasm. We are recommending investigating methods to counteract its behavior.
