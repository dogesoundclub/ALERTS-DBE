SCP-5185 is a delivery driver of unknown origins. It resembles a monkey, with a curious demeanor and bright, inquisitive eyes framed by nerdy glasses. It always sports a blue bandana atop its head, a golden hoop earring dangling from one of its monkey ears. Though it may seem like your typical street-wise simian, SCP-5185 possesses a wit as sharp as a razor, with a dry sense of humor that can catch even the most unexpecting humans off guard.

While SCP-5185 may not consider itself the life of the party, it has a knack for delivering deadpan zingers that rival those of famous comedians. This uncanny ability not only makes it a favorite amongst its co-workers, but it also allows it to seamlessly blend into human society; something that is essential for its job as a delivery driver. However, its ability to use humor as a defense mechanism also makes it an unpredictable entity, and caution should always be exercised when dealing with SCP-5185.
