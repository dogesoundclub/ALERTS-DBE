**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3561 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The room is decorated with warm colors and is equipped with several fidget toys, puzzles, and drawing material for the comfort of the subject. All audio and visual recordings of SCP-3561 are to be archived in a secure server, accessible only by Level 3 personnel or higher.

**Description:** SCP-3561 is a female human of Asian descent, approximately 27 years of age. SCP-3561's skin is unusually pale with orange stripes running along her cheeks. The subject's lips are bright red, and her eyebrows are orange. SCP-3561's hairstyle resembles an 00s schoolgirl's, complete with bangs covering the forehead.

SCP-3561's personality is characterized by a high level of meticulousness and obsessiveness. The subject is detail-oriented and tends to display compulsive behavior, such as alphabetizing her spice rack and color-coding her closet. Studies reveal that SCP-3561's particular skill is not in any way related to these behaviors.

SCP-3561's skill as a computer programmer is exceptional, and her ability to code has helped the Foundation more than once in critical situations. SCP-3561 can complete tasks quickly and with high accuracy. SCP-3561's mood affects her skill level; agitation can lead to short-circuits in her thinking, causing her to make errors.

SCP-3561 claims to have used her abilities for personal gains, sometime in the past, as a 'white hacker' in some large corporations; nonetheless, SCP-3561 displays remarkable loyalty towards the Foundation, often stating that this is the only purpose she has found in life. SCP-3561 expressed willingness to perform death-defying tasks for the Foundation, citing that the success of the organization is her only sense of satisfaction.
