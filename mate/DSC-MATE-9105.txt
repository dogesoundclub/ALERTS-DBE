Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9105 is to be monitored via GPS tracking while on duty as a delivery driver. They are not to be approached or contacted by Foundation personnel unless necessary. In the event of a containment breach or other emergency, SCP-9105 may be temporarily secured at Site ██ for their own safety and the safety of others.

Description: SCP-9105 is a male tiger, standing approximately 2.2 meters tall and weighing approximately 220 kilograms. Their fur is a mixture of dark and light orange, with black stripes covering their entire body. SCP-9105 wears normal glasses and has a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-9105's forehead features two color bands, one black and one white. A red cross earring is attached to SCP-9105's left ear, which emits a faint anomalous aura when in proximity to human subjects. When in contact with SCP-9105, individuals report feeling a sense of comfort and security.

SCP-9105 displays a highly empathetic and compassionate personality, often taking on the problems of others as their own. While admirable, this behavior can be exhausting and potentially dangerous if SCP-9105 becomes overwhelmed. 

Addendum: SCP-9105 has expressed a desire to assist the Foundation in its mission. While their abilities may not be directly applicable to containment and research, their potential use as a friendly and comforting presence during sensitive procedures or interviews is being considered. Further evaluation is required before any such interactions take place.
