Item #: SCP-8626

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8626 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage, measuring 10m x 10m x 10m, with diamond-plated walls and a reinforced door. The cage must be equipped with a remote-controlled feed system, which is to provide SCP-8626 with live prey on a regular basis.

SCP-8626's cage must also be fitted with a soundproofing system, as SCP-8626 has been known to emit extremely loud roars that can cause damage to nearby structures and personnel. Any personnel entering SCP-8626's cage must wear sound dampening ear protection and full-body armor.

Description: SCP-8626 is a male tiger standing at 2m in height and weighing approximately 200kg. Its most notable features include a pair of ski goggle-like eyes, a police cap on its head, a gold earring on each ear, and a red scarf tied around its neck. SCP-8626's mouth is usually covered with a medical mask for hygiene reasons.

SCP-8626 displays a strong sense of independence and may often resist humanoid authority or rules that it sees as unnecessary. Its rebellious behavior can include sneaking out of its containment chamber or taking a day off without permission from the Foundation.

SCP-8626 also exhibits superior hunting skills and an almost preternatural intelligence. Often displaying behaviors that mimic human-like problem-solving abilities.

Addendum: It has been observed that SCP-8626 seems to have an unusual grudge against law enforcement agencies and human civilization at large. It has been known to act aggressively against people wearing police uniforms or possessing military vehicles.

Any attempts to communicate with SCP-8626 have been met with hostility, and the creature has thus been labeled a villain. It is not to be underestimated or approached lightly, as SCP-8626 poses a significant threat to human life and property.
