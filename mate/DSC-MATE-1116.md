Subject 1116 is a fashion designer, identified as a human male with peculiar features that warrant further investigation. Upon initial observation, subject 1116 exhibits prominent spots on their face, further accompanied by a frightened mouth. However, it's the subject's ski goggle-shaped eyes that stand out as particularly anomalous in nature. The head, while not arranged in any unusual orientation, displays an unnatural green hue that may warrant further examination.

A peculiar feature of subject 1116's forehead is the presence of a goggle seemingly attached to their forehead. The purpose of this device is currently unknown, but it may serve as an enhancement to their senses or extracurricular activities.

Subject 1116's personality can be described as energetic and enthusiastic, exhibiting a tendency towards excitement in the presence of others. In some cases, this can lead to the subject getting overly excited about aspects that may not be of interest to others, leading to humorous situations.

Further monitoring is required to determine any potential anomalous properties exhibited by subject 1116. In the meantime, caution must be exercised when interacting with the subject to prevent any potential breaches.
