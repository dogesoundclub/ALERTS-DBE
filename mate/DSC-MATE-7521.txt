Item #: SCP-7521

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7521 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with furniture and amenities suitable for a tiger species. Wardens are to wear thick body armor when entering the chamber, and no contact with the subject is allowed outside of scheduled tests and feeding times. 

SCP-7521 is currently working as a fast food employee at [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], and must be monitored by Foundation agents during work hours to ensure compliance with containment procedures. 

Description: SCP-7521 is a male tiger, standing at 6ft tall and weighing approximately 220lbs. Its facial expression constantly appears frightened, and its eyes are multi-colored VR LED lights. SCP-7521 wears a blue bandana on its head, has goggles resting on its forehead, a red scarf hanging around its neck, and an LED gas mask.

SCP-7521 values tradition; it has a no-nonsense attitude, and enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through its family or community. Despite its playful nature, SCP-7521 is highly aggressive towards those that disrespect its beliefs or values. 

Addendum: On [REDACTED], SCP-7521 had an altercation with an unruly customer, resulting in a containment breach. The fast food restaurant's security footage shows SCP-7521 attacking the customer and immune to physical harm while wearing its LED gas mask. Several civilians were injured, but no causalities were reported. SCP-7521 was located and re-contained by Foundation personnel, and the incident was labeled an "animal attack." Further testing and evaluations are necessary.
