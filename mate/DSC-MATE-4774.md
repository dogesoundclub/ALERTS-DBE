Item #: 4774

Object Class: Sapien

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4774 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, reinforced by layers of bulletproof glass and electrified fences. All staff are advised to maintain a safe distance from the cage, especially during feeding or cleaning times.

Description:

Subject 4774 appears to be a male adult tiger, standing at a height of 6 feet and weighing approximately 500 pounds. Its most notable features include a bucket hat, red cross earring, and a thick gold chain encompassing its neck. It commonly smokes cigarettes, though the effects of such substances on its body are still under investigation.

At first glance, Subject 4774 may seem to be a formidable foe; however, its sharp wit and playful personality make it a popular figure among its fellow mafia members. It enjoys engaging in arguments, debates, and word play, typically taking on any challenge with its quick thinking and persuasive skills.

However, as with any dangerous predator, Subject 4774 should not be taken for granted. Its feline instincts, razor-sharp claws, and enormous strength make it a formidable opponent in any situation. Its leadership position within the mafia has also led to a highly secretive lifestyle, resulting in an air of suspicion surrounding its true motives and intentions.

Do not engage in any physical or verbal confrontation with Subject 4774, and contact your nearest Supervisor immediately if any unusual behavior or activity is noted.
