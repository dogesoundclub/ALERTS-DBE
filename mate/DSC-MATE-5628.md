Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-5628 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██ when not in use. The chamber must be designed to take into account the subject's unique features, including his tiger-like appearance, red beanie, blue clown eyes, two-color band on his forehead, jade earring, red scarf, and candy stick. DSC-MATE-5628 must be fed a specialized diet of raw meat and provided with enough room for exercise.

Description:

DSC-MATE-5628 appears to be a humanoid tiger, standing at approx. 200 cm in height and weighing about 160 kg. Its fur is orange and black, and it has blue clown eyes that are often desaturated. The subject wears a red beanie, a red scarf, and a two-color band on its forehead. In addition, DSC-MATE-5628 sports a jade earring on its right ear and is often seen holding a candy stick.

DSC-MATE-5628's personality is characterized by his forgetfulness and absent-mindedness, which can often lead to comical situations in his personal life. The subject has been known to forget important appointments or lose track of time while working on a project.

DSC-MATE-5628 works as a delivery driver for a local courier company, and its ability to blend in with the local human population has led to particular note by Foundation personnel. It is important to note that any interaction with DSC-MATE-5628 should be carefully monitored as its behavior can be unpredictable.

Addendum:

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-5628 was observed displaying uncharacteristically aggressive behavior while delivering a package to a private residence. The subject reportedly attacked the homeowner after being questioned about the contents of the package. Foundation personnel were immediately dispatched to the scene, and DSC-MATE-5628 was contained without further incident.

Due to the incident, further testing of DSC-MATE-5628 has been suspended until a thorough evaluation is conducted to determine the cause of its behavior.
