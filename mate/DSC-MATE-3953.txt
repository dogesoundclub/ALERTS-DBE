Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3953 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-3953 must be granted only by Level 2 personnel or higher.

SCP-3953 is currently employed as a car salesman, and its work location is to be monitored by Foundation agents. SCP-3953 is to be monitored regularly for any behavioral abnormalities.

Description: SCP-3953 is a female human of average height and weight. It has green hair and wears a purple cap. SCP-3953's eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and it wears a red cross earring on its left ear.

SCP-3953 frequently wears a medical mask and a choker around its neck. Personality-wise, SCP-3953 tends to be introspective and lost in thought. This trait results in some humorous situations, such as walking into a pole or tripping over objects.

Addendum: Despite SCP-3953's lack of anomalous abilities, its employment as a car salesman creates a potential hazard.
