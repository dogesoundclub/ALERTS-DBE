Item #: SCP-9372

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9372 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with a constant supply of fresh vegetables and hay. Due to its idealistic nature, it is to be provided with a platform to express its opinions and concerns, but any attempts to incite protests or boycotts must be strictly monitored and intervened if needed. Any attempt to remove its candy stick or jade earring is strictly prohibited, as it has been observed to agitate SCP-9372.

Description: SCP-9372 is a male rabbit of unknown age and origin. It is distinguishable by its frightened mouth and VR rainbow LED eyes. It wears a blue bandana on its head, which it claims to be a symbol of its mechanics profession. SCP-9372 also wears goggles on its forehead and a jade earring in its left ear. It is often seen carrying a red scarf and a candy stick, both of which it considers important to its well-being.

SCP-9372 possesses a strong desire to make the world a better place, often expressing its idealistic views to anyone who will listen. It has been observed to participate in protests and boycotts against companies or causes that it feels go against its values. This tendency has caused some humorous situations, as SCP-9372 can be easily manipulated by disinformation or propaganda.

SCP-9372's mechanical proficiency has been noted to be above average, despite not possessing any formal training or experience in the field. It has been observed to disassemble and reassemble various mechanical devices and vehicles with ease, often claiming that it did so to "make them run better."

Addendum: SCP-9372's idealistic views have caused concern among the research team, as it has shown signs of radicalization towards various political ideas. Any attempt to further expose SCP-9372 towards such ideas is to be strictly monitored and intervened when necessary.
