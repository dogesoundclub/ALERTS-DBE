Item #: SCP-3739

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3739 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Any interaction with SCP-3739 must be conducted through a two-way communication system.

SCP-3739 is currently employed as a news anchor for a local news station under Foundation control. SCP-3739 is to follow a scripted program and is not allowed to breach from the script during his on-air appearances. Any deviation from the script must be reported immediately.

SCP-3739 is allowed access to its red scarf and cigarette in its personal quarters for on-site relaxation purposes only. SCP-3739's jade earring must remain off its person during all times of interaction with Foundation personnel. 

Description: SCP-3739 is a humanoid male with orange stripes on its face. SCP-3739's eyes are blue and have the appearance of a clown. Its head is covered by a purple cap with a headset for communication purposes. 

SCP-3739's personality is known for its strong sense of duty and responsibility, but also its love for fun. SCP-3739 is capable of entertaining and leading group activities, making them a suitable host for on-air programs. However, SCP-3739 has demonstrated instances of deviating from their scripted programing and going "off-script" during their on-air appearances. 

SCP-3739 has displayed the ability to influence others to participate in their spontaneous actions, but it is not known if this is a cognitohazard effect. Further research is being conducted on this anomaly. 

Addendum: During a recent interview, SCP-3739 expressed its desire for off-site social interactions. All requests have been denied as a precautionary measure.
