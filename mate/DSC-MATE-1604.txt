Item #: SCP-1604

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1604 is to be kept in a secure, soundproof containment chamber at Site-██. Interaction with SCP-1604 must be limited to approved research personnel only. Psychological counseling is to be provided to any personnel who shows signs of emotional distress after interacting with SCP-1604.

Description: SCP-1604 is a middle-aged human male, with a notable preference for wearing a hoodie and nerd glasses. SCP-1604 appears to be a veterinarian, specializing in the treatment of domestic animals. However, SCP-1604 displays a unique personality trait that is not commonly observed in other humans; extreme empathy.

SCP-1604's empathetic nature is both a strength and a weakness. They have an uncanny ability to understand the emotional needs of animals and humans that come into their care. This makes them an exceptional veterinarian, praised by many for their ability to treat animals with kindness and compassion. However, SCP-1604's empathy can also be a burden. They tend to take on the problems of others as their own, becoming fixated on helping others at the expense of their own well-being.

SCP-1604 also wears a silver chain around their neck, which appears to have some sort of sentimental value. The chain has been analyzed and shows no anomalous properties.

Addendum: SCP-1604 was brought to the Foundation's attention after several reports of strange and sudden 'healing' of wounds and illnesses in animals that had been treated by SCP-1604. Further investigation confirmed that SCP-1604 possesses an anomalous ability to heal animals, to a limited extent. However, it is unclear if SCP-1604 is aware of this ability or if they are intentionally using it. Research into the extent of SCP-1604's abilities is ongoing.
