Item #: 2801

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2801 is to be housed in a standard-issue human cell at Site ██. They are allowed limited access to the Site's recreational facilities, but must be monitored at all times by Level 3 staff. DSC-MATE-2801's access to electronic devices is prohibited. Any attempts to communicate with external sources must be monitored and approved by the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-2801 is a female human, identified as the manager of a local theater in the late 19██s. They possess peculiar physical features such as orange stripes across the cheeks, red lips, blue clown eyes, green hair underneath a purple cap, and gold earrings on the ears, along with a lit cigarette held in the left hand. It is believed that these features were obtained through anomalous means.

DSC-MATE-2801 primarily exhibits a friendly persona, valuing social bonds and harmony, but also possesses a playful and comedic side. This may lead to instances of levity that can jeopardize Foundation security measures. DSC-MATE-2801 displays no anomalistic properties aside from their physical appearance, and it is currently unknown if they possess any other potential anomalous traits.

Addendum: On ██/█/20██, DSC-MATE-2801 breached Foundation protocol by leaving a cryptic message on the Site Director's answering machine. The message contained a series of nonsensical phrases combined with vague threats. It is believed that DSC-MATE-2801 obtained the means to contact external sources through unknown means. It has been recommended that the Foundation enhance security protocols around DSC-MATE-2801's cell to prevent any further breaches.
