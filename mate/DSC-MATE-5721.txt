Item #: 5721

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5721 is to be contained within a standard humanoid cell. The walls of the cell must be reinforced for containment of an adult Tiger. Any interactions with SCP-5721 must be conducted via a remote feed, due to the possible hazardous nature of the subject. The gas mask worn by SCP-5721 must be replaced daily.

Description: SCP-5721 is a male tiger standing 2.5 meters tall at his hindquarters. SCP-5721's face features are that of a constantly frightened individual, as if heâ€™s constantly on the run. On SCP-5721's head is a red bucket hat with a hole cut out for its ears. Additionally, SCP-5721 has a normal gas mask strapped to its face at all times.

SCP-5721 exhibits strong sense of duty and responsibility, taking on more work than it can handle. This has resulted in humorous situations, such as SCP-5721 trying to carry too many things at once or fitting all of its tasks into a single day. 

SCP-5721 was discovered at an IT company where it worked as a programmer for several years. Its co-workers did not appear to notice its existence as anything but a remarkably talented and hard-working individual. There were some reports of staff being injured on their way to or from work, supposedly attacked by a large, frantic animal, believed to be SCP-5721 in its natural form.

Addendum 5721-A: Despite its willingness to participate in containment procedures, SCP-5721 displays a certain anxiousness around other humans, especially those it doesn't know. It is important to note that SCP-5721 has never been observed outside of its tiger form. Efforts to communicate with it regarding any anomalous abilities are underway.
