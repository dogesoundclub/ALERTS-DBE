SCP-8319 is a Train Driver of the human race with a startling appearance. Its head is covered with green layers resembling that of a tree bark. SCP-8319 also sports a gold earring on each ear, which is apparently its attempt to stand out from the mundane everyday life it lives. Its facial expression is always a frightened mouth, as if something is lurking and about to jump out at any moment.

To add to that, SCP-8319 is also seen usually wearing a medical mask, presumably as a measure to shield against harmful airborne pathogens. It is also never seen without a gold chain that seems to hold some sort of significance to it.

SCP-8319 exhibits a very interesting personality. Despite the seemingly bleak appearance, it has a strong sense of duty and responsibility as a train driver. However, it also knows how to have fun and enjoy life, which has resulted in scenes where it catches others off-guard with its dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor at social events.

It is strongly advised that SCP-8319 does not drive the train while wearing its medical mask, as it may obstruct its vision and lead to serious accidents. Psychological evaluations have been conducted, and the test results have shown that SCP-8319 poses no threat to the general public or any anomalous entities. Therefore, there is no need for containment measures, and it may continue operating as a train driver without hindrance.
