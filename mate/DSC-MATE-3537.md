Item #: DSC-MATE-3537

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3537 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be fed a diet of standard rabbit food and given bedding, as well as toys for entertainment. Any changes in behavior are to be reported to the assigned researcher immediately for examination.

Description: DSC-MATE-3537 is a humanoid rabbit, standing at 1.5 meters tall. It wears a red beanie with a red victory band on its forehead. Its mouth is in a perpetually frightened expression. The eyes are currently unknown due to the LED gas mask that it wears over the upper half of its face.

DSC-MATE-3537 possesses strong empathy, often easily picking up on emotional cues from others. This has led to some humorous situations where DSC-MATE-3537 will say the right words to console or uplift an individual in a difficult situation. It is unknown if this ability is related to DSC-MATE-3537’s anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-3537 is a skilled programmer, able to create software and codes at an accelerated speed compared to non-anomalous individuals. However, DSC-MATE-3537’s coding often contains unknown language and symbols that have yet to be deciphered. Attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-3537 about its coding have been met with fear and agitation.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, DSC-MATE-3537 experienced a severe panic attack, resulting in the removal of its LED gas mask. Its eyes were discovered to be completely black, with no signs of a pupil or iris. Further examination is necessary to determine if this is a natural trait or if it is an effect of DSC-MATE-3537’s anomalous abilities.
