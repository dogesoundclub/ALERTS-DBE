Item #: DSC-MATE-3239

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3239 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Due to its unpredictable behavior, armed guards must be present at all times during interaction with DSC-MATE-3239. The subject is allowed a red scarf and a candy stick as comfort items, but they must be searched for any hidden anomalies before being granted to DSC-MATE-3239.

Description: DSC-MATE-3239 is a human male, identified as a banker, with several distinctive features. The subject has spotted skin on its face and a frequently frightened mouth, which may indicate a history of anxiety or trauma. DSC-MATE-3239 also has a mohawk hairstyle that appears to be a deliberate fashion statement.

In terms of personality, DSC-MATE-3239 is highly empathetic and compassionate. This characteristic, although admirable, puts the subject in a vulnerable position where it may feel responsible for everyone around it. DSC-MATE-3239 has a tendency to take on other people's problems as its own, leading to exhaustion and potential mental breakdowns.

DSC-MATE-3239's red scarf and candy stick appear to provide it with a sense of comfort and security. Any attempts to remove these items have resulted in aggressive behavior and, in some cases, a full-blown panic attack.

If allowed too much freedom, DSC-MATE-3239 may attempt to fix or “heal” other DSCs or personnel, leading to potential breaches or irreversible damage.

Overall, while DSC-MATE-3239 exhibits no anomalous abilities itself, its highly empathetic behavior and potential to take on others' problems can make it a valuable asset or a potential danger to containment efforts. Therefore, strict containment procedures must be maintained at all times.
