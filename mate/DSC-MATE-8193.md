Item #: 8193

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The subject should be kept in a reinforced cage with titanium walls, and a minimum of three guards should be present at all times. The cage is to be equipped with an extensive ventilation system to prevent the buildup of toxic fumes. The subject should be sedated before any interaction takes place.

Description: Item 8193 is a male Bengal tiger with a blue and white coat. The subject has a large victory band on its forehead, and wears a jade earring in one of its ears. On its neck, there is a gold chain with an unknown purpose.

The subject has blue clown eyes, creating an eerie contrast to its fearsome nature. It has a frightened, open mouth that is almost always snarling, especially when it is in proximity to humans.

Personality: Despite its fearsome appearance, Item 8193 has a surprising laid-back and easy-going attitude. It has a fierce sense of loyalty and will protect its loved ones at all costs. This strong protective instinct has led to some comical situations where the subject has gotten into heated arguments with anyone who insults a friend or family member.

It is unclear how this tiger came to possess such human-like emotions and a heightened sense of loyalty, but it makes it a dangerous threat to any potential attackers. Its unpredictable behavior makes it one of the Foundation's most challenging subjects to contain.
