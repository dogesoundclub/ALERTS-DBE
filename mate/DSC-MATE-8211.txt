Item #: 8211

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8211 is to be kept in a secure, soundproof, and temperature-controlled chamber at Site-██. The chamber's walls and ceiling should be constructed with reinforced titanium and watched continuously by security personnel armed with tranquilizer guns. Any instances of SCP-8211 attempting to leave their containment area are to be stopped by force, if necessary.  Access to SCP-8211 is restricted to Level 4 personnel only.

Description: SCP-8211 is a male tiger that stands 9 feet in height and weighs approximately 600 pounds. Its fur is a striking red with black stripes and it has blue clown-like eyes. SCP-8211 exhibits two bandages of differing colors wrapped around their forehead and has a pair of goggles resting on their forehead. Additionally, SCP-8211 has green hair that is usually seen resting in a purple cap.

The subject has acquired a reputation within Foundation personnel and staff as a professional veterinarian. They wear a jade earring in their left ear and can often be seen playing with the accessory or smoking cigarettes. SCP-8211 is known to be extremely hardworking, taking on more than they can handle on occasion, which can lead to humorous situations as they struggle to organize their time effectively.

SCP-8211 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel but has expressed a strong desire to leave its containment and continue its work as a veterinarian. It is currently unknown how SCP-8211 acquired its anomalous traits or whether it was born with them. Investigations are ongoing. 

Addendum 8211-A: SCP-8211's containment chamber was temporarily breached during an attempted escape. SCP-8211 reportedly used its immense strength to break through several layers of reinforced titanium walls before being subdued by Foundation personnel. Following the incident, an upgrade in SCP-8211's containment chamber has been scheduled. The current chamber dimensions are to be tripled and strengthened with reinforced adamantium.
