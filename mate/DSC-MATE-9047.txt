Object Class: Keter

Description: SCP-9047 appears to be a male monkey wearing a police cap and nerd glasses. Its distinctive feature is a red scarf around its neck. SCP-9047 is employed as a banker, working at [REDACTED] bank. It was discovered after numerous reports of anomalous financial transactions involving SCP-9047.

SCP-9047 has the ability to control financial transactions with its mind. This ability is triggered when it is lost in thought, which happens very frequently. When SCP-9047 becomes lost in thought, its eyes will sparkle with a green light, and any financial transaction it performs will be under its direct control. It is unknown how SCP-9047 developed this ability or how it came into the possession of the police cap and nerd glasses.

SCP-9047 has a tendency to be introspective and loses track of its surroundings. This behavior can lead to unintentional accidents, such as walking into poles or tripping over objects, whilst lost in thought. SCP-9047 has displayed friendly behavior towards Foundation personnel during interviews, but it is advised to treat SCP-9047 with caution.

SCP-9047 is considered Keter due to its ability to manipulate financial transactions and its ability to cause chaos in the financial industry. Any attempt to contain SCP-9047 physically will result in aggressive behavior and potential monetary losses.

Addendum: Testing has shown that SCP-9047 is also capable of telekinetic abilities, such as levitating small objects within its line of sight. Further testing is required to determine the extent of its anomalous capabilities.
