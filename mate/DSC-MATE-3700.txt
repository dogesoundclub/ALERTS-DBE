Item #: SCP-3700

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3700 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with a separate area allocated for communication equipment. SCP-3700 is allowed to retain their profession as a news anchor and must have access to regular communication equipment for this purpose. Under no circumstances should SCP-3700 be allowed to engage with any live broadcasts without prior permission from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3700 is a male Eastern Cottontail rabbit of approximately 35 years of age with distinctive normal glasses and a blue bandana on their head. Additionally, SCP-3700 wears a red scarf and an LED gas mask. The gas mask is to be removed under no circumstances.

SCP-3700 displays anomalous abilities associated with heightened intuition and precognitive aptitude. SCP-3700 is able to predict events before they happen and sense strong emotions in humans, frequently commenting on emotional changes during news broadcasts. SCP-3700’s predictions have proven accurate in approximately 87% of events. However, such abilities cause SCP-3700 to appear eerie and cause unease in those around them.

SCP-3700 was detected by the Foundation after numerous reports were made about SCP-3700’s ability to predict news events before they occurred. SCP-3700’s identity as a news anchor allowed them to maintain anonymity while providing them with access to a broader audience whilst hiding their true nature.

Addendum: After testing, SCP-3700 has shown to have limited vocalizations but demonstrates intelligence levels which surpass typical rabbit characteristics. SCP-3700 has requested access to literature and other forms of media for mental stimulation. Access has been granted on a case-by-case basis. SCP-3700 may also request the use of any news agency recording equipment in order to produce audio or video material for personal entertainment. Approval will be subject to review by appropriate personnel.
