All communication between SCP-6986 and the outside world is to be monitored, as well as any interaction between SCP-6986 and other SCP members. SCP-6986 is allowed to continue their political career as it is believed that this helps to maintain their mental stability.

Description: SCP-6986 is a male humanoid with orange stripes on his face and green layers on his head. SCP-6986's mouth is always covered by a medical mask and his blue clown eyes are constantly wide and frightened. SCP-6986 also has green cross earrings in both ears. Despite these unusual physical traits, SCP-6986 is a human.

SCP-6986 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often leading to them taking on more tasks than they can handle. This causes humorous situations such as attempting to carry too many items or being unable to complete all of their responsibilities in a single day. SCP-6986 is known to have a charismatic personality and is popular among their constituents.

SCP-6986 is an active politician, which is believed to help maintain their mental stability. However, due to their anomalous characteristics, SCP-6986 has been tasked with introducing bills and policies beneficial to the SCP Foundation's interests. SCP-6986 has agreed to this arrangement and has proven to be a valuable asset in implementing Foundation objectives in the political arena.

Addendum: SCP-6986's anomalous traits are still being researched to fully understand their implications on the overall mission of the SCP Foundation. It is important to monitor SCP-6986's mental and physical well-being to ensure their continued cooperation.
