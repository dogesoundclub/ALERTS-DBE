Item #: 5930

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5930 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber, with the addition of various tools and materials necessary for their work as a doctor. Personnel are advised to approach the subject with caution, as sudden movements or loud noises may cause undue stress and aggression.

Description: Subject 5930 is a male monkey, standing approximately 3 feet tall when upright. Their physical appearance is otherwise unremarkable, save for a perpetually frightened expression on their mouth. The subject is often seen wearing a hoodie, which they use to cover their head in moments of extreme stress.

Despite their primitive appearance, 5930 has displayed a remarkable aptitude for practical problem solving. They approach all tasks in a hands-on manner, and have been known to repair broken items in unconventional ways - often employing duct tape, paper clips, or other makeshift solutions. Despite the unusual nature of their methods, 5930's repairs are often surprisingly effective.

The subject is capable of communication, both through verbal and non-verbal means. They have a tendency to become anxious and aggressive in stressful situations, particularly if they feel that their work is being hindered by others. In general, 5930 is an unpredictable presence, and should be approached with caution.

Addendum: Subject 5930's skills as a doctor have proven invaluable in treating injuries and illnesses not typically found in human patients. However, it is important to note that their methods and techniques are often unconventional, and should be double-checked by a qualified medical professional. Any attempts to exploit or weaponize 5930's abilities will not be tolerated.
