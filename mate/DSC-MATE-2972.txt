Item #: 2972

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell that should be provided with ample space and furniture for relaxation. The subject requires no special dietary requirements, but will require a constant supply of tissues.

Description: SCP-2972 is a humanoid rabbit of male gender who appears to be employed in the sales industry. The subject's body is covered in white fur, with long and floppy rabbit ears. During his initial containment, the subject was discovered to be wearing a green bucket hat, gold earrings and a chain, and goggles on his forehead. The subject's glasses also appear to be a permanent feature, which may contribute to its "nerdy" appearance.

The subject's emotional state appears to be heightened at all times, with sentimentality having a deep impact on their moods. SCP-2972 has been known to become upset or teary-eyed during movie screenings, or after listening to certain types of music. These emotional reactions manifest themselves physically and may affect the subject's productivity during a work environment.

SCP-2972 displays abilities for effective sales talking and business management techniques. However, the subject's empathetic abilities may also be utilized during trade negotiations, allowing them to bargain effectively.

Addendum: The subject was discovered following a report of an unusual rabbit attempting to sell cars to minors. The rabbit's charismatic personality was discovered to be a strong contributing factor towards their success in sales, posing a significant financial threat to other car dealerships in the area. After reports, the subject was swiftly brought into Foundation custody.

SCP-2972 may be involved in negotiations in regards to purchase of a new Foundation vehicle fleet.
