Item #: DSC-MATE-7111

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7111 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. Its purple cap and jade earring are to be removed upon containment, and it is to be allowed one hour of outdoor exercise per day under the supervision of at least two armed guards.

Description: DSC-MATE-7111 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis with blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth. It is approximately 1.5 meters tall when standing upright and weighs approximately 25 kg. DSC-MATE-7111 wears a purple cap with a headset, a red scarf, and a normal gas mask.

DSC-MATE-7111 was discovered working as a police officer in a small rural town in [REDACTED], where its unusual appearance initially sparked concern among the civilian population. The Foundation became involved when DSC-MATE-7111 was reported to have single-handedly dispersed a riot using unknown abilities. Once containment was established, testing revealed that DSC-MATE-7111's abilities appear to be related to its love of adventure and taking risks.

DSC-MATE-7111's personality is extremely friendly and outgoing, with a love for adventure that often leads it into dangerous situations. Its enthusiasm for trying new things has led to multiple incidents of Near-Death Experiences (NDE) that DSC-MATE-7111 always manages to survive, such as bungee jumping and getting lost in wilderness areas. However, DSC-MATE-7111 has difficulty following orders and tends to act impulsively even in dangerous situations.

Addendum: Due to its unique abilities, DSC-MATE-7111 has been assigned to Mobile Task Force Delta-3 ("Monkey Business"), and has shown to be an effective asset in certain missions. However, care must be taken to prevent DSC-MATE-7111 from taking unnecessary risks or endangering its own life.
