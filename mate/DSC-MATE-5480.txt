Addendum: Interview Log 5480-01

Interviewer: Dr. [REDACTED]
Interviewee: SCP-5480

Dr. [REDACTED]: Good morning, SCP-5480. Can you tell us a bit about yourself?

SCP-5480: Hey, Doc! What's up? I'm a reporter for [REDACTED], and I like to explore new things.

Dr. [REDACTED]: We've noticed that you tend to act on your emotions sometimes. Do you think that could pose any danger?

SCP-5480: Heh. Now, that's a good one! Sometimes, impulsiveness is exactly what is called for. You can't always expect things to go as planned, you know?

Dr. [REDACTED]: That might be true, but everyone needs to be careful when dealing with unexpected situations. So, how do you feel about being kept in this containment facility?

SCP-5480: Well, I'm not really one for being cooped up inside like this. But I understand the need for proper containment protocols.

Dr. [REDACTED]: That's good to hear. And how do you like your LED gas mask?

SCP-5480: Oh, this old thing? I love it! I never know when I'll need to explore where there's too much smoke or dust. Gotta protect your lungs, you know?

Dr. [REDACTED]: Understood. Well, that's all the time we have for today.

SCP-5480: Already? Well, alright then. Catch you later, Doc!
