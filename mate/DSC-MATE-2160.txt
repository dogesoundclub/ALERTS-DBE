Special Containment Procedures: 

Doctor 2160 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be fitted with an additional ventilation system to ensure that proper airflow is maintained. Doctor 2160 must be provided with a daily supply of fruits and nuts, which should be inspected by a member of the research team before being given to Doctor 2160.

Description: 

Doctor 2160 is a male monkey whose fur color is primarily brown. His physical features include a frightened mouth, and his eyes are VR rainbow LED. His head is adorned with a blue bandana, and he wears a gold earring in his left ear. Doctor 2160 can often be seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

Doctor 2160 is highly intelligent and displays an exceptional sense of duty and responsibility, which has led him to take on more than he can handle at times. This has resulted in several humorous situations, such as when he attempts to carry too many objects at once or cannot fit all of his tasks into a single day.

Doctor 2160 has a unique communicative ability that allows him to speak human language fluently. His scientific knowledge is also impressive, and he has demonstrated a keen interest in the medical field. Despite his strong personality and intelligence, however, Doctor 2160 remains somewhat reclusive and can be defensive when he feels threatened.

Addendum: 

Doctor 2160's past is unknown, and it is unclear how he acquired his knowledge or his communicative ability. Some members of the research team have expressed concerns that Doctor 2160 may pose a danger to himself or to others if not properly contained. Further investigation is required to determine the full extent of his capabilities and the potential risks associated with his containment.
