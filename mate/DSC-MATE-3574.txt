Description: Subject 3574 is a human male, with an unusual eye configuration resembling ski goggles. The subject often wears a traditional monk's hood covering the remainder of their face, obscuring any facial features. The ears are pierced with gold earrings and the subject often wears a silver chain around their neck. A cigarette is a must-have item for the subject, and they can often be seen smoking even in non-smoking locations.

Subject 3574 is a well-known politician with a reputation for their great sense of humor. They are a natural-born performer and love nothing more than to make others laugh, often at their own expense. This has led to some amusing situations, where the subject has been known to tell raunchy jokes or perform silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Despite the subject's humorous nature, they are a cunning strategist and possess a quick wit, making them a formidable opponent.

In addition, Subject 3574 has exhibited an unusual resistance to mind-altering effects, both magical and chemical. This resistance may be due to the subject's meditation practices, but more research is needed to confirm this theory.
