Item #: DSC-MATE-370

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-370 is to be kept under constant surveillance, with at least two guards present at all times. Any attempts to leave the containment area should be met with immediate force. In the event that DSC-MATE-370 is found outside of its containment cell, all individuals within a 30-meter radius must be evacuated and administered amnestics.

Description: DSC-MATE-370 is a human male of average height and weight, with orange stripes prominently displayed on his face. His eyes are replaced with ski goggles, while his head is covered with a police cap. An earring made of jade is present on his left ear, and he always wears a medical mask to prevent recognition.

Although DSC-MATE-370 is classified as a human, it exhibits a number of anomalous characteristics that cannot be explained by current scientific understanding. The subject is highly impulsive, with a tendency to take extreme risks without any apparent fear of danger. This has led to several humorous, yet dangerous, situations, including jumping off tall cliffs into nearby bodies of water without any visible injury.

DSC-MATE-370 is currently employed as a traffic officer, where he poses a significant risk to public safety due to his reckless behavior. Several attempts to coerce DSC-MATE-370 into ceasing his dangerous activities have been unsuccessful, and it is likely that he will continue to exhibit this behavior in the future.

Addendum: [DSC-MATE-370B]

After witnessing DSC-MATE-370's reckless behavior, several foundation scientists have hypothesized that DSC-MATE-370's anomalous traits may stem from a cognitohazard that has yet to be identified. An agent has been dispatched to investigate the possibility of DSC-MATE-370 being exposed to any such hazards.
