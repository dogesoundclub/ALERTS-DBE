Item #: SCP-6847

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6847 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell located within Site-19. SCP-6847 is to be provided with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as a moderate amount of cigarettes and any other legal substances that it requests. All personnel are required to wear Class A hazmat suits when within SCP-6847's containment chamber as a precaution against possible zoonotic diseases.

Description: SCP-6847 is a male monkey of the Cercopithecidae family, commonly known as the "mangabey monkey." SCP-6847 stands at roughly 0.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 20 kilograms. The monkey has a striking appearance, wearing a blue bandana on its head, a pair of shade glasses over its eyes, and a jade earring on one of its ears. It also has a red scarf wrapped around its neck and a lit cigarette constantly in its hand.

SCP-6847's personality is generally laid-back and easy-going, although it will become fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. This has led to several humorous situations, including arguments with those who insult its family or friends. SCP-6847 is also currently employed as a fast food worker, although the reasons behind its employment are currently unknown.

Addendum: SCP-6847 has been diagnosed with several zoonotic diseases, including B virus, Herpes B virus, and Simian Immunodeficiency virus. The monkey has been isolated and is undergoing treatment for these conditions. Further research is required to determine how SCP-6847 was infected with these diseases and to what extent they pose a threat to human health.
