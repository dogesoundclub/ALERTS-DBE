Item #: DSC-MATE-2893

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2893 is to be monitored via remote cameras, as direct observation has proved to be difficult due to the anomalous nature of the subject. DSC-MATE-2893 is to remain within their designated train vehicle and is to be given regular medical evaluations.

DSC-MATE-2893's train route is to be shifted on a monthly basis to prevent any possible connection with any possible pattern or familiarity of the area. It is important to note that under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-2893 be allowed to exit the train, as it puts the surrounding area and populace in danger.

Description: DSC-MATE-2893 is a female humanoid who was formerly employed as a train driver. DSC-MATE-2893 appears to be a humanoid with a pink rabbit head and red cross earring ears. The subject's most striking feature is their purple lip, which is genetically different from that of any known human. DSC-MATE-2893's eyes are always covered with normal glasses.

DSC-MATE-2893 is usually seen wearing a silver chain around their neck and also dons a normal gas mask, although the reason for this is currently unknown. The anomalous abilities of DSC-MATE-2893 are directly linked to the current location of train which it is driving, causing unpredictable changes in the train's interior.

DSC-MATE-2893 slightly appears scatterbrained and may have a tendency to forget things, causing potential risky situations for the train passengers or even surroundings. Researchers report that DSC-MATE-2893 may suffer from short term memory lapses, which can in turn lead to abnormal behavior.

Addendum 2893-1: DSC-MATE-2893 is to be provided necessary medical care and periodic psychiatric evaluations to assess their motivation, and clearance, for possible future interviews. It should be noted that direct communication with DSC-MATE-2893 is unimaginable under the present circumstances. Any further evaluations will be conducted remotely by qualified personnel.

Addendum 2893-2: DSC-MATE-2893 was positively identified during a raid on an illegal genetic mutation in ██████. Mobile Task Force Epsilon 11-Alpha (Dog Heads) was deployed to bring DSC-MATE-2893 under Foundation Control.
