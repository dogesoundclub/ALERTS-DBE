Item #: 7164

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7164 is to be monitored at all times through audio and video surveillance. Any unauthorized attempts to communicate with 7164 must be immediately reported to the containment team. It is crucial that 7164's location is not disclosed to the public under any circumstances.

Description: 7164 appears to be a male humanoid rabbit equipped with a red beanie and peculiar forehead features, including a two-color band and goggles. The subject bears a gold earring highlighting its right ear, while a red scarf and cigarette serve as its accessories. 7164's eyes are yet to be confirmed.

Personality-wise, the subject exhibits practicality and a hands-on approach, leading it to fix things unconventionally, even applying duct tape or paper clips as part of its problem-solving strategy.

Subjects who come into contact with 7164 have reported feeling calmed and empowered by its presence, much to the species' bizarre nature. It is unknown whether this ability has any lasting effects on humanoids with whom 7164 interacts.

Addendum 1: 7164 was captured in the act of delivering a speech during a political rally in █████████, attracting the attention of Foundation agents. The subject's anomalous properties were detected shortly after capturing.

Addendum 2: During the course of the investigation, the containment team discovered that 7164 may possess a low-level of reality-warping abilities, prompting the team to revise its classification further.

Addendum 3: The latest interaction between 7164 and a high-ranking Foundation officer was met with hostility, suggesting that the subject might not be as benevolent as initially perceived. Further monitoring and possible containment revision may be necessary.
