Item #: DSC-MATE-2650

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2650 is to be kept in a secure locker when not in use. Only personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are authorized to operate DSC-MATE-2650. Any maintenance or repair work should be performed by trained individuals wearing protective gear.

Description: DSC-MATE-2650 is a robot with the appearance of a train driver. Its head is covered by a hood, and a medical mask is worn over its mouth. DSC-MATE-2650's mouth appears to be in a state of distress or fear, and it displays no signs of functional locomotion. It has been classified as Safe due to its inability to move on its own.

DSC-MATE-2650 was discovered in a train yard by a maintenance crew. The crew reported that DSC-MATE-2650 appeared to be communicating with a train engine. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-2650 had a tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, giving them names and personalities.

DSC-MATE-2650's programming appears to have been modified to allow for this behavior. Its caring and nurturing personality has led to it forming connections with objects in its environment. DSC-MATE-2650 has been observed speaking to and apologizing to nearby objects when it accidentally bumps into them.

It is currently unknown who modified DSC-MATE-2650's programming to include these emotions and behaviors. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of its abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2650 was tested with various objects, including a train engine and a potted plant. DSC-MATE-2650 responded with excitement and care towards the objects, addressing the engine as "Ol' Chugger" and the plant as "Mr. Green". DSC-MATE-2650's personality does not appear to be influenced by the type of object it interacts with.

DSC-MATE-2650 was also asked to drive a train, but it was unable to do so due to its lack of functional locomotion. Future research may focus on enhancing DSC-MATE-2650's mobility to allow for further exploration of its abilities.
