The subject has blonde hair with a unique feature of a wing protruding from her head. A distinctive two-color band is present above the forehead. The subject's ears have gold earrings, and she wears a gold chain around her neck as an accessory.

Subject 1101 is known for her rebellious nature, often resisting and questioning authority figures and rules that she deems unnecessary. This leads to her taking days off without permission or leaving her office early. Although cooperative, the subject maintains her independence and autonomy fiercely.

Addendum: Subject 1101's performance as a police officer has been deemed exceptional. She has received numerous commendations for her exceptional work in cases involving paranormal activity.

The potential for her to discover the existence of the Foundation is high and must be monitored closely.
