SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-840, also known as "The Vet", is a human male of unknown age and origins. His appearance is distinct with a mouth spot, a smile, and nerd glasses that frames his eyes. Atop his head is a doge hat, reminiscent of the internet meme, and a noticeable gold earring that hangs from his ear. He always wears a medical mask, most likely due to his profession as a veterinarian. Adorning his neck is a gold chain that he seems to never take off.

Despite his appearance, SCP-840 displays a unique personality that is heavily influenced by his community and traditions. He values these traditions and can display a no-nonsense attitude when necessary. However, he also possesses a playful side that can lead to humorous situations where he tells amusing jokes or stories passed down through his family or community.

Although SCP-840 seems to lead a mundane life as a veterinarian, his anomalous abilities are yet to be fully understood. He has been observed to possess remarkable healing abilities, even on animals that were deemed untreatable by standard veterinary practices. Some staff members speculate that SCP-840 may have connections to the supernatural or have access to otherworldly resources.

As a precaution, SCP-840 must remain within the Foundation's containment facility, and all interactions with staff must be supervised. Any unauthorized contact with SCP-840 is prohibited.
