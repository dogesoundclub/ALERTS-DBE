Description: Item 7025 is a male monkey approximately 1.02 meters tall with red clown eyes and gold earrings. The subject weighs approximately 20.41 kilograms and is adorned with a silver chain and equipped with a normal gas mask. The subject has been identified as a qualified medical practitioner, possessing extensive knowledge of human anatomy and medical procedures.

Personality: Item 7025 is a sociable creature, and their natural tendencies lean towards establishing and maintaining social connections. Though they tend to live in harmony with others, their playful and goofy side occasionally takes over, resulting in playful banter and practical jokes with both fellow monkeys and human staff. Despite this, the subject shows a professional level of commitment to their responsibilities as a doctor and has a reputation for taking the welfare of their patients seriously.

Addendum: Item 7025 was discovered in a circus troupe in Eastern Europe after numerous cases of staff and audience members suffering from severe respiratory infections.

Investigations into this anomalous ability are ongoing.
