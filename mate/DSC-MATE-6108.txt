Despite their affinity for colorful headwear and a wicked sense of humor, this subject has been assigned to the vital position of Security Guard, tasked with maintaining the boundaries of the strange and fantastical realm in which they reside.

Their sharp gaze is framed by Normal Glasses, fascinating and perplexing objects of great importance to their species. In addition, they are rarely seen without their golden chain, a self-imposed collar to signify their loyalty to the cause.

They are possessed of a great sense of humor, one that is infectious and capable of bringing joy to even the most somber situations. Their greatest weapons are their uplifting tales and their absurd impersonations, weapons that they have honed over many years to diffuse even the most tense of scenarios.

Subject 6108 is a fine example of a Human, prone to laughter and frivolity in even the darkest of hours. However, they are a valuable asset to the cause, and one that should be treated with respect and admiration for their tireless service in the preservation of order and balance.
