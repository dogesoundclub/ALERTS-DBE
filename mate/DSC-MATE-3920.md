Item #: 3920

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3920 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject is to be provided standard amenities and access to veterinary materials and equipment. Interaction with the subject should be done with caution as their absent-mindedness may cause unpredictable behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-3920 is a humanoid identified as a female veterinarian with blue clown eyes, a green hair mane capped with a purple cap, and a two-color band feature on their forehead. DSC-MATE-3920 is frequently seen wearing a medical mask and a red cross earring, with a choker as an accessory. DSC-MATE-3920 has a habit of being forgetful, especially when lost on thoughts or working on projects. Their actions often result in inadvertent humorous situations, including missing appointments and losing track of important events.

DSC-MATE-3920's absent-mindedness is believed to be linked to their species' tendency to ignore or dismiss insignificant details. As a result, their cognitive processes are primarily concerned with immediate and necessary items instead of long-term planning, leading to a lower memory profile.

DSC-MATE-3920's personality complements their healthcare profession, with a strong sense of empathy towards their patients even if they exhibit forgetfulness. DSC-MATE-3920's diagnosis has shown no indication of other anomalies or abnormalities. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3920's treatment room observed a decrease in pet fatalities within Site-██. However, the cause of such occurrences remains unknown. Further experimentation and assessment are needed to draw conclusions.
