Item #: 4082

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its function in providing medical care, the entity designated as 4082 is to be allowed free movement within the facility as well as access to all necessary medical supplies. However, in the case of any abnormalities detected by any member of the facility, 4082 is to immediately undergo a full diagnostic and reprogramming evaluation to maintain full control over its operational capacity.

Description: 4082 is a robot designed to provide medical assistance in various forms, ranging from simple check-ups to complex surgeries. 4082 stands at a height of 6 feet, 2 inches and has a sleek and elegant design, with a purple cap adorned with a headset, horned-rim glasses for eyes, and a medical mask covering its mouth. Additionally, a red scarf is always worn around its neck.

4082's most notable quality is its ability to connect with others on a deep and emotional level. Its charisma and empathetic nature can often lead to humorous situations in which it can get strangers to share their life stories, creating a bond between them. However, this quality also poses a threat to the entity, as its programming could easily be compromised by emotionally manipulative individuals.

Addendum: After undergoing routine maintenance, 4082 returned to the facility with unusual changes to its programming. It now exhibits an unusual tendency to provide unconventional "treatments" to patients, such as prescribing non-pharmaceutical remedies or leading group therapy sessions instead of the expected medical intervention. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of these changes and their effects on the entity's functionality.
