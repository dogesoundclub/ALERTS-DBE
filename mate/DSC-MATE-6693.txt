**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6693 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Personnel assigned to SCP-6693 must wear full body protection and limit contact. The containment unit must have a non-reflective surface, as to not trigger SCP-6693's potential ability to cause hallucinations. All communication with SCP-6693 must be done through a speaker system.
 
**Description:** SCP-6693 appears to be a human female, with unusual physical features. She has spots all over her face and a purple lip, and her eyes resemble clown makeup with vibrant blue coloration. She has a pink rabbit for a head, with ears adorned with a red cross earring. SCP-6693 prefers to wear a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-6693 is able to communicate effectively and displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility, despite her appearance. However, she has also demonstrated the ability to let loose and have fun. SCP-6693 enjoys social events, often surprising others with her dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor. 

SCP-6693 has been observed to have the potential to emit an unknown chemical that causes hallucinations in those within a certain distance of her. Testing is ongoing to determine the nature of this ability and its range. 

SCP-6693's profession is that of a real estate agent, where she has been observed to use her charming personality and ability to perceive the desires of potential buyers to her advantage. Further investigation into her abilities and potential threats to the Foundation is ongoing. 

**Addendum 6693-A:** SCP-6693 has expressed an interest in contributing to the Foundation through use of her abilities. Further investigation into any potential use SCP-6693 could have for the Foundation is ongoing.
