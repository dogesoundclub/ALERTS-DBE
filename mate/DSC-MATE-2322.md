Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2322 is to be monitored closely while on duty as a Traffic Officer in the metropolitan area. Any unusual behavior or sudden changes in personality are to be reported immediately to the designated supervisor. 2322 is prohibited from accessing any confidential information or entering restricted areas without proper clearance.

Description: 2322 is a human male with spotted face features and normal glasses. He is often seen wearing a hoodie and a gold chain as an accessory. Despite his mundane profession as a Traffic Officer, 2322 possesses a unique personality trait. He has an insatiable thirst for knowledge and is often engrossed in reading and researching various topics, especially those that are obscure and unconventional. 

2322 has been known to collect books, documentaries, and other educational materials, which he shares passionately with others. However, he has also displayed a fascination with potentially dangerous subjects, particularly in the realms of the supernatural and occult. It is unclear whether his increased interest in these topics is due to his job, or whether he has had prior exposure to them. Nevertheless, measures have been taken to ensure that 2322 is not allowed access to any sensitive information or areas related to these subjects.

While 2322 is cooperative and generally well-behaved, his peculiar personality traits may pose a risk to his own safety and that of others. It is therefore necessary to monitor him closely and take appropriate actions if necessary.
