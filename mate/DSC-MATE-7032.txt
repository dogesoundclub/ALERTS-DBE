Item #: SCP-7032

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7032 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to her tendency to resist authority, clear and concise communication is essential when interacting with SCP-7032.

Description: SCP-7032 is a human female identified as a fast food worker, with blonde hair and blue clown eyes. The subject has distinct spots on her face and a constant smile, providing an appearance of cheery demeanor. SCP-7032 has a wing protruding from the right side of her head, and a two-color band above her forehead with goggles resting atop.

SCP-7032 possesses unique personality traits that set her apart from others of her species. The subject exhibits a strong sense of independence, often resisting authority or rules that they deem unnecessary. This has led to incidents of rebellious behavior, such as leaving work early without permission or absence from work.

Despite her rebellious nature, SCP-7032 has displayed a cooperative attitude towards Foundation personnel. However, caution should be exercised to prevent SCP-7032 from taking advantage of any vulnerabilities.

Addendum: SCP-7032 has shown an affinity for collecting various fast food items and memorabilia. Foundation personnel are permitted to indulge in conversation with the subject about their interests to promote positive behavior. Any items brought into SCP-7032's containment chamber must be screened and approved by Site supervision.
