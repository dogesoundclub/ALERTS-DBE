Item #: SCP-6892

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6892 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to the nature of her abilities, SCP-6892 must wear an inhibitor collar at all times. Any requests for her to extinguish fires must be thoroughly vetted by the Fire suppression team before being granted.

Description: SCP-6892 appears to be a human female in her mid-twenties with blue clown eyes and an 00s schoolgirl styled haircut. She is often seen wearing gold earrings, a choker, and a cigarette. SCP-6892 is a former firefighter turned anomalous entity after an event involving an unknown substance.

SCP-6892's anomalous ability to manipulate fire is both involuntary and unpredictable. Her emotional state, skill level, and even physical exertion can cause an outburst of flame from her palms, emitting temperatures up to [REDACTED] Celsius. SCP-6892 has expressed difficulty in controlling these outbursts, often referring to the flames as a second personality.

SCP-6892 is generally social, cheerful, and has a tendency to act recklessly. While her abilities could make her an excellent firefighter, this behavior often causes minor mishaps and accidents for SCP-6892 and those around her.

Addendum: Dr. ██████ has proposed the use of SCP-6892 in firefighting, as her abilities can be a valuable asset in suppressing fires. However, the danger to personnel and potential collateral damage makes this proposal questionable. This request is under consideration by the Fire suppression team.
