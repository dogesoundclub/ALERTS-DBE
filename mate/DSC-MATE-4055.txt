Description: Subject 4055 is a male human of average height, with distinct spots covering much of their face. Subject's head is shaved, except for a raised mohawk in the center. A green cross earring adorns each ear, and a silver chain is often observed around the neck.

Personality: The subject possesses a deep curiosity for the world around them, and an affinity for obscure or unusual knowledge. They tend to engage in conversations with a wide range of subjects, often leading to some amusing instances where they would randomly spout off obscure facts or trivia to others.
