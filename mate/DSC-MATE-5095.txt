Item #: 5095

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5095 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cell with soundproof walls and kept under constant surveillance. All personnel must maintain a distance of at least ten meters from the subject at all times. Subject is to be provided with a single chair and a table for writing, but no other objects of interest are to be stored in her cell.

Description: 5095 is a human female with numerous spots covering her face, arms, and legs. Her most notable feature is her VR Rainbow LED eyes, which are constantly cycling through different colors. The subject wears a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring in each ear. Her mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and she wears a choker around her neck.

The subject is the leader of a notorious mafia organization and is widely feared among the criminal underworld. Her operatives are known to carry out brutal acts of violence without hesitation, and they follow her commands to the letter. However, despite her ruthless reputation, the subject tends to be introspective and lost in thought, often tripping or walking into objects while daydreaming.

It is unclear how the subject obtained her unusual eye implants, but they have been observed to emit powerful bursts of light that can temporarily blind onlookers. Her choker appears to have anomalous properties, allowing her to manipulate objects and people within a ten-meter radius. She is also believed to possess other unknown abilities, which pose a significant threat to both Foundation personnel and the general population.

Subject 5095 should be considered highly dangerous and must be kept under close observation at all times. Any attempts to approach or communicate with the subject should be avoided unless strictly necessary. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to take extreme caution and enact the appropriate emergency protocols immediately.
