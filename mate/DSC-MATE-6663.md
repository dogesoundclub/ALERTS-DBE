Item #: 6663

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6663 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, which must provide adequate food, water, and space for the subject. Personnel entering the containment chamber are required to put on noise-cancelling headphones, as DSC-MATE-6663 has a tendency to yell aggressively.

Description: DSC-MATE-6663 is a male tiger that possesses unique cosmetic features. Its eyes appear to be a VR Rainbow LED, and it sports a bucket hat and a red cross earring in its ears. DSC-MATE-6663 is known to wear a gold chain around its neck and carry a whistle.

DSC-MATE-6663 has a frightened expression on its face that makes it appear as though it is always in a state of fear. However, it is unclear whether this expression is a natural feature or a result of past traumas. DSC-MATE-6663 is able to speak fluent English, though it has a strong accent, which makes it difficult to understand.

DSC-MATE-6663's personality is characterized by a dry sense of humor, which often catches people off guard. Despite its fear, DSC-MATE-6663 has a way of delivering deadpan jokes that are surprisingly funny. It relishes in causing confusion among those around it, and it will sometimes use its gold chain to distract attention away from itself.

DSC-MATE-6663 was initially discovered working as a car salesman in a local dealership. It became evident that DSC-MATE-6663 possessed unusual traits that warranted further investigation. Its golden chain was found to have anomalous properties, which allowed DSC-MATE-6663 to teleport short distances.

Due to its potential danger in public areas, DSC-MATE-6663 is considered Euclid. Research is ongoing to determine the full extent of its abilities and any other anomalous features it may possess.
