SCP-9448, also known as "The Purple-Lipped Car Saleswoman," is a female human with an eccentric appearance that is hard to miss. Her face prominently features bright purple lipstick, which contrasts starkly with her pale, almost white skin. The most striking feature of her appearance, however, are her red clown eyes that seem to follow you wherever you go.

SCP-9448's head is adorned with an oversized, feathered wing that resembles that of a bird of prey, adding to her already eerie appearance. She is often seen with a cigarette in hand, often leaving a lingering trail of smoke behind her.

Despite her outwardly weird appearance, SCP-9448 is a skilled and charismatic car salesman. She has a strong sense of duty and responsibility and will do anything necessary to fulfil her job properly. She is professional and organized, always making sure that her customers find the perfect vehicle for their needs.

At the same time, SCP-9448 is also a fun-loving party-goer. She loves to dance and sing along to her favorite songs, which often results in her becoming the center of attention at events.

SCP-9448's quirky charm can be disarming, but keep in mind that she can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Any contact with SCP-9448 must be recorded and reported to the proper authorities immediately.
