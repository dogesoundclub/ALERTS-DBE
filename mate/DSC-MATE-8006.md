Item #: 8006

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8006 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber with a minimum of 10 square meters of space. Regular exercise and social interaction with other sentient entities are required to maintain the subject's mental and physical health. Any visitors to the containment chamber must wear Level 2 protective gear to avoid possible infection.

Description: Subject 8006 is a male monkey of an unknown species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. The most unusual feature of the subject is its blue clown eyes, which seem to change in color and intensity depending on its emotional state or the amount of ambient light. The subject wears a retro cap on its head, a red scarf around its neck, and a normal gas mask over its mouth and nose. The purpose of the gas mask is unclear, as the subject does not appear to have any respiratory problems or release any toxic substances.

Personality: Subject 8006 exhibits a mix of traditional and playful behaviors. It often tells jokes and stories that have been passed down through its family or community, highlighting its value for cultural heritage. However, the subject can also be no-nonsense, especially when it comes to its duties as a veterinarian. It shows a particular fondness for animals and takes their well-being seriously.

Addendum: Subject 8006 was recovered from an abandoned circus in Romania after reports of bizarre animal mutations and illnesses. Upon examination, it was discovered that the subject's DNA had been spliced with various unknown pathogens and chemicals, presumably by the circus owner for unknown purposes. Although the subject does not currently show any symptoms of contagion, further studies are necessary to determine the extent of the mutation and the potential risks to other living beings.
