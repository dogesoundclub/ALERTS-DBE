Item #: 6364 

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6364 must be kept away from non-foundation personnel due to its unique properties. In the event that a civilian comes into contact with 6364, amnestics must be administered immediately. 6364 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with a specialized ventilation system. At no time are any other rabbits allowed in the same chamber as 6364.

Description: 6364 appears to be a typical grey and white rabbit with glasses that give off the appearance of a nerd-like personality. The rabbit also has a 2 color band on its forehead and is often seen wearing a gold earring and a silver chain. Despite its seemingly innocent appearance, 6364 is capable of speaking fluent English with impeccable grammar, leading researchers to conclude that it is highly intelligent.

Personality: 6364 exhibits a highly analytical and logical nature, often making witty observations and teasing those around it in a dry, deadpan way. Its humorous personality is a stark contrast to its serious surroundings, often amusing the foundation staff working with it. However, despite its quirky personality, 6364 is not to be underestimated as even the slightest agitation can result in unexpected and dangerous consequences.

Addendum: In light of recent events involving 6364, all personnel are reminded that they are not to underestimate the rabbit's abilities. 6364 should be treated with the utmost caution, as it has already exhibited the capability to cause severe harm to foundation personnel when provoked.
