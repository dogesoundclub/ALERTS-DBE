Object Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6232 is to be kept under surveillance at all times and confined to a designated area within Site-██. Any communication between SCP-6232 and non-Foundation personnel is strictly prohibited, and any attempts to breach containment must be met with immediate response.

Description: SCP-6232 is a human male of unknown age and origin, measuring 1.82 meters in height and weighing approximately 82 kilograms. Notably, SCP-6232's eyes resemble those of a clown, with a red iris and black sclerae, and its head is not arranged in a typical manner for humans, appearing to have grown in a wild, uneven fashion, resulting in a lumpy and asymmetrical appearance. Additionally, SCP-6232 wears a medical mask over its mouth and a gold earring in its left ear, with a thick gold chain around its neck.

SCP-6232's personality is characterized by impulsive behavior and a tendency to act on its emotions rather than considering the consequences of its actions. Though this can lead to humorous situations at times, it also poses a risk to containment protocols and the safety of Foundation personnel.

SCP-6232's occupation prior to containment was as a banker, though the details of its work history are not known.

Addendum: Incident Report 6232-01
On █/██/20██, SCP-6232 breached containment by overpowering two security personnel after becoming agitated during a routine medical examination. During the course of its escape in the facility, SCP-6232 caused moderate structural damage to the containment wing and injured two more personnel before being subdued and returned to confinement.

Further monitoring and reinforcement of containment protocols for SCP-6232 have been enacted to prevent any further incidents.
