Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-6189, also known as "The Tiger", is to be contained within a secure room at all times. The room must be equipped with reinforced steel walls, temperature and humidity control, and a ventilation system that will maintain a steady flow of fresh air. All personnel entering the containment area must be authorized by Level 3 or higher staff and go through checkpoint scanning.

Description:
SCP-6189 is a male Tiger humanoid standing at 1.8 meters tall and weighing 250 kg. They have blue clown eyes, which are a distinct characteristic among its species, and are always wearing a medical mask over their mouth. This mask is described as the only piece of clothing that they seem to need. Additionally, they wear a gold earring on their left ear and a silver chain around their neck as accessories.

Personality:
SCP-6189's personality is unique among its kind. They have a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. Even if they don't consider themselves to be the life of the party, they have a way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. SCP-6189 is often seen as deeply intellectual, preferring solitude over interactions with others. They're known to engage in philosophical discussions with other staff members and have a severely analytical mind; often seen as a critical thinker.

Conclusion:
SCP-6189 must be treated with caution at all times, and testing with staff members is not allowed under any circumstances. The Tiger has displayed behavior consistent with a high intelligence level, which raises questions about how it came into existence. Further examinations are necessary to determine If SCP-6189 possesses anomalous properties, which require further research by Level 4 or higher staff.
