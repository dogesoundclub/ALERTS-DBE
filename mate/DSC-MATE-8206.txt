Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8206 is to be monitored at all times and is required to check in with his assigned handler every two hours. Any instances of unusual behavior or actions that deviate from standard patterns should be immediately reported.

Subject 8206 is currently working as a car salesman, and his employer is to be kept under surveillance as well. Access to his workplace and all data regarding him are to be strictly controlled.

Description: SCP-8206 is a human male, with orange stripes on his face and a retro cap on his head. He wears normal glasses and a goggle on his forehead. SCP-8206 is always seen wearing a red scarf and a gas mask.

SCP-8206 possesses a strong desire to make the world a better place, which can lead to unusual and unexpected behavior. He has been known to protest or boycott companies or causes that he believes do not align with his values. SCP-8206 is very idealistic and is driven by this desire for change.

SCP-8206's gas mask is functional and appears to be used as a personal protection device. His behavior indicates that he may be sensitive to pollutants or other airborne contaminants. This aspect of his behavior requires further investigation.

Addendum: SCP-8206's employer reported that he was behaving erratically and seemed to be attempting to convince his customers not to purchase a car due to the environmental impact. SCP-8206 was brought in for questioning and has since been placed under observation. SCP-8206's idealism and the potential threat it poses to our world require attention and continued monitoring.
