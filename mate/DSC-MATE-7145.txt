Item #: SCP-7145

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7145 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. All personnel interacting with SCP-7145 must wear eye protection to prevent the subject from utilizing their anomalous traits. Access to candy sticks is strictly prohibited within SCP-7145's containment area.

Description: SCP-7145 is a male human approximately 28 years of age. The subject possesses ski goggle eyes which appear to be permanently attached to their skull. SCP-7145 always wears a blue bandana on their head and is frequently observed carrying a candy stick, which is their preferred method of consuming sugar.

SCP-7145 displays a unique personality characterized by an unusual mix of organization and spontaneity. The subject is known for its meticulous planning and its tendency to surprise its colleagues with last-minute adventures or party planning.

Due to SCP-7145's anomalous eyes, which possess both infrared and night vision capabilities, the subject is capable of seeing in nearly any condition. This has proven particularly useful during nighttime operations and has resulted in successful raids on Foundation facilities.

SCP-7145's candy stick is also believed to possess mild mind-altering properties, which can be used by the subject for the purpose of persuasion.

Addendum: SCP-7145 is considered a high-threat entity, and all personnel interacting with the subject should exercise caution. Under no circumstances are candy sticks to be provided to SCP-7145, as this could result in the subject becoming uncontrollable.
