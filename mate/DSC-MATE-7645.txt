Item #: SCP-7645

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7645 is to be kept isolated within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-7645 requires Level 3 clearance and above. Personnel interacting with SCP-7645 must wear earplugs to avoid the potential influence of SCP-7645's emotional state. Attempts by SCP-7645 to manipulate or influence staff must be reported to on-site security immediately.

Description: SCP-7645 appears to be a human male in their mid-forties, who identifies as a politician. However, SCP-7645's features and attire have led researchers to suspect that they may possess anomalous properties. SCP-7645 is often seen wearing a "Doge" hat on their head and a medical mask over their mouth. However, the most striking feature of SCP-7645 is their LED VR Rainbow eyes, which emit a variety of colors and frequencies based on SCP-7645's emotional state.

SCP-7645 exhibits a strong emotional response to various stimuli, including music, art, and sentimental moments in movies and TV shows. These responses can vary from extreme happiness to profound sadness, and even tears. Even more concerningly, SCP-7645 has displayed the ability to manipulate emotions in those around them through physical contact or intense eye contact. SCP-7645 appears to be aware of this ability and has used it to their advantage on multiple occasions.

SCP-7646's past is largely unknown, though it is believed that they may have been involved in criminal activities prior to their containment.

Addendum: Following an incident in which SCP-7645 attempted to manipulate the emotions of on-site personnel during a scheduled visit from a political delegation, all future visits from political personnel to SCP facilities are to be approved by Site Directors and monitored by trained security personnel.
