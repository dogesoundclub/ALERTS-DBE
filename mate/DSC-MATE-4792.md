Item 4792's hair is parted and dyed pink, and a pair of safety goggles are positioned on his forehead at all times. Item 4792 also wears a gold earring in his left ear.

Personality: Item 4792's personality is noted for their highly analytical and logical nature, bordering on obsessive. However, when they believe they are among friends or people they are comfortable with, they have a quirky sense of humor and enjoy making witty observations or executing dry or deadpan humor. They have a deep-seated fear of the unknown and the paranormal, which may stem from their occupation as a reporter. 

Addendum: Item 4792's position as a reporter brings significant concerns to its containment. Item 4792 will be monitored and kept away from any items classified as Euclid or Keter, and strict controls will be put in place to ensure he does not learn of any sensitive Foundation operations. Its privileges to interview Foundation personnel will be rescinded.
