Item #: SCP-6295

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6295 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber suitable for primate specimens. The chamber is to be fitted with a soundproof glass window and monitored at all times while personnel are on duty.

SCP-6295 is to be issued a standard issue traffic officer uniform, including a purple cap, nerd glasses, and a headset. SCP-6295 is also to be fitted with a gold chain and normal gas mask as per previous observations of anomalous behaviors.

Under no circumstances should personnel engage in extended conversations with SCP-6295 outside of normal job-related duties.

Description: SCP-6295 is a monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, standing approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighing 15 kg. SCP-6295 was initially reported to the foundation after reports of unusual predictions by local residents. 

SCP-6295 has exhibited a propensity for a strong sense of intuition, much akin to precognition, which can be both impressive and eerie. SCP-6295 has shown to predict events in the future, including accidents and other disturbances, with a significant degree of accuracy. 

Access to and from SCP-6295's chamber must be strictly supervised to ensure that SCP-6295 does not intercept classified information. 

Personnel reports indicate that SCP-6295 exhibits human traits and has a distinct sense of humor. However, SCP-6295's strongest trait is its keen sense of intuition. 

Addendum: SCP-6295 has displayed the ability to sense human emotions accurately. The Foundation is currently investigating SCP-6295's potential to detect anomalous properties and to aid in containment missions. Requests to assign SCP-6295 to mobile containment teams are under review.
