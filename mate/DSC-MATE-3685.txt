Item #: SCP-3685

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3685 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to the nature of its occupation as a reporter, SCP-3685 is permitted to keep its recording equipment within its chamber. Access to SCP-3685's containment chamber is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-3685 appears as a male Bengal tiger with a blue bandana covering its head, a gold earring in its left ear, and horned rim glasses resting on its nose. SCP-3685 wears a medical mask over its mouth at all times. An anomalous gold chain is also present on SCP-3685's person, which cannot be removed without causing severe agitation and distress.

SCP-3685 maintains a jovial and light-hearted personality, often entertaining Foundation personnel with its sense of humor. SCP-3685 has a natural charm and may attempt to lighten any heavy moods or tense situations with funny stories or silly impersonations. However, it is advised that personnel maintain a professional manner when interacting with SCP-3685.

SCP-3685's occupation as a reporter is a useful asset to the Foundation, as it allows for the dissemination of disinformation and controlling the narrative of anomalous events. SCP-3685's access to sensitive areas is strictly monitored and controlled, and any information it obtains is reviewed and redacted as necessary.

Addendum: SCP-3685 has expressed a desire to interview several humanoid SCP objects, citing it as an opportunity to showcase the humorous side of Foundation containment procedures. Due to the unpredictable nature of some of these SCP objects, this request has been denied.
