Secure, Contain, Protect: SCP Foundation

Item #: SCP-7028

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7028 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with all necessary amenities provided. Due to SCP-7028's occupation as a fashion designer, it is permitted to access a sketchpad and pencils for creative expression. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel must wear standard gas masks.

Description: SCP-7028 is a Human female with spots on her face, pigtail hairstyle, and red cross earrings on her ears. SCP-7028 is generally friendly and easy-going, with a great sense of humor that often makes others laugh. This behavior may lead to humorous situations, such as telling jokes and doing silly impressions.

SCP-7028 is a talented fashion designer and is responsible for creating many high-end clothing items. SCP-7028's accessory preferences include a gold chain and a gas mask, which serves as a representation of the increasingly polluted environment.

SCP-7028 was discovered in [REDACTED], where it was creating a new line of clothing featuring gas masks as a statement piece. Foundation agents were sent in to contain SCP-7028 and administer amnestics to any witnesses.

Addendum 7028-1: SCP-7028's gas mask seems to have a preternatural quality that has yet to be explained. Several individuals have reported being able to see and interact with spectral beings while wearing it, but further testing is required. The Ethics Committee has issued a directive that such testing may only be done with the express written consent of the persons in question.
