SCP-630, also known by her human name Anne-Marie, is a train driver of unknown origin. A non-anomalous human, Anne-Marie's appearance is easily identified by her prominent spots on her face. She is often seen sporting a bucket hat atop her head, with a pair of goggles resting just above her forehead. One of her green cross earrings dangles prominently from her left ear, while a gold chain adorns her neck. 

Anne-Marie is known for her reckless tendencies and impulsive behavior. While her actions can at times lead to humorous situations, she does pose a danger to those around her. It is advised that caution be exercised when engaging with her, as she may act without considering the consequences. Despite her tendency to act before she thinks things through, Anne-Marie is known to be a friendly and approachable individual. 

While Anne-Marie may seem like an ordinary human on the surface, her tendency towards recklessness may indicate a deeper underlying psychological anomaly. It is recommended that further observation be conducted on SCP-630 to determine any potential anomalies that may be present.
