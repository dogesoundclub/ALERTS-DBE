Item #: SCP-60

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-60 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. SCP-60 is permitted to continue its work as a delivery driver under the guise of a normal rabbit. SCP-60 is to be monitored via surveillance cameras and any behavior that deviates from its normal routine is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-60 is a male rabbit with the ability to speak English. SCP-60 is easily identifiable by its retro cap and red victory band on its forehead. SCP-60 also wears a gold chain and carries a whistle with it at all times. SCP-60's eyes are currently unknown as it refuses to remove its cap, however, it has shown no abnormal behavior pertaining to its vision.

SCP-60 exhibits a friendly and outgoing personality, valuing harmony and social connections above all else. SCP-60 has been observed engaging in playful banter with others, often telling jokes and attempting to make those around it laugh. It has also shown a goofy side, which has resulted in humorous situations on several occasions.

SCP-60's abilities have been tested and it has been determined that it possesses no extraordinary abilities beyond its ability to speak English. However, SCP-60's behavior suggests that it may have some level of intelligence above that of a normal rabbit.

Addendum: SCP-60 has requested that it be allowed to continue its job as a delivery driver, claiming that it finds the work fulfilling and enjoys the social interactions it allows. After reviewing the request and finding no major faults, the Site Director has granted SCP-60 permission to continue its work with an extended work schedule to allow for proper containment.
