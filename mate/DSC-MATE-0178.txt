Description:

SCP-178, also known as "The Banker," is a humanoid rabbit creature that has been observed to possess exceptional organizational skills and efficiency in its work. The subject is typically clad in a retro cap and a gold chain around its neck, accompanied by a candy stick that it frequently gnaws on. 

SCP-178's blue clown eyes are its most striking feature, conveying a certain degree of charm and whimsy that often contradict its serious demeanor. It has been known to command authority over group projects, delegating tasks in a matter-of-fact manner that can come across as controlling. Nonetheless, it has been noted that its methods are highly effective and produce impressive results.

It is rare for SCP-178 to exhibit any behavior that would be deemed hostile; however, individuals who have crossed it or threatened its efficacy have experienced a vindictiveness that is uncharacteristic of its normally controlled personality. Despite its soft and fuzzy exterior, SCP-178 harbors a razor-sharp intellect and the potential to cause significant damage if provoked. 

Given its unique abilities, SCP-178 has been utilized in a variety of tasks that require excellent organization and attention to detail. Its contribution to the Foundation has been invaluable in terms of streamlining complex operations and optimizing resource allocation.
