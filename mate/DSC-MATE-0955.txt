Addendum: Incident Report 955-01

On [REDACTED], SCP-955 successfully convinced several Foundation personnel to allow her to explore an abandoned building. Despite the risks involved, SCP-955 was able to navigate the building and recover several anomalous objects. Though she was not injured during the expedition, Foundation personnel were appropriately reprimanded for allowing SCP-955 to undertake such a dangerous activity without proper approval. Future requests for exploratory activities must be thoroughly vetted before approval is granted.
