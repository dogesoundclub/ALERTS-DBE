Item #: 8368

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8368 is to be held in a standard containment chamber at all times when not performing duties as a security guard. They are to be provided with a comfortable living space and access to any inanimate objects they may have a fondness for. Any objects not provided by the Foundation must be screened for any potential anomalous effects before being allowed into their possession. 

Description: 8368 is a humanoid female with orange stripes across their face, and blue clown-like eyes. Their head hair is not arranged, and their forehead features a unique two-color band. They wear gold earrings and a silver chain as accessories. 8368 has been identified as human, though their personality displays atypical levels of empathy towards inanimate objects. 

Despite their occupation as a security guard, 8368 has demonstrated a strong nurturing instinct, often caring for and anthropomorphizing various inanimate objects, such as their car, plants, and household appliances. These behaviors have not posed any immediate danger to the Foundation, but they are being monitored for any potential risks. 

Addendum: Request for further testing into 8368's ability to emotionally affect inanimate objects has been approved. Testing will be conducted under controlled conditions to determine if there are any anomalous properties at play. Results of the testing will be analyzed and used to inform future containment strategies.
