Item #: 2955

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2955 is to be housed in a standard human living quarters within Site-19. Standard procedures and resources are to be provided for daily care and maintenance.

Description: Subject 2955 is a female human of unspecified age, with distinctive orange stripes present on their facial features. The subject is characterized by a disarming smile, and normal prescription glasses. Their head is colored with green and features an edge curl. A silver chain is worn around the subject's neck, which up until recently was believed to be a part of their psychological profile.

Subject 2955 presents a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, a facade which has been noted to immediately disarm individuals they come in contact with. However, closer observation reveals their protective nature; particularly when it comes to friends and family. It has been observed that they are quick to argue passionately and defend them against insult and harm.

Addendum: After discovering Subject 2955â€™s odd silver chain was actually an anomalous artifact, a containment breach was narrowly avoided. Item was successfully contained and the subject is now labeled as a low risk associate researcher with normal security clearance levels.
