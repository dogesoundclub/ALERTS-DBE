Item #: 1555

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1555 is to be monitored on a regular basis for any signs of an abnormal attachment to its candy stick accessory. SCP-1555 is to be interviewed periodically for psychological evaluation purposes. SCP-1555 is to report any unusual feelings or urges related to candy sticks or gift-giving to its assigned researcher immediately.

Description: SCP-1555 is a human male of average build, standing at approximately 175 cm tall. The entity is adorned with a variety of unusual accessories, including a doge hat and gold earrings. SCP-1555's most notable distinguishing feature is a mouth spot, which appears as a permanent stain on its upper lip. The entity has bright ski goggle eyes that are frequently overshadowed by a frightened mouth expression.

SCP-1555 is best known to the Foundation as a delivery driver for a local courier service. Despite displaying an abnormal attraction to its candy stick, SCP-1555 otherwise exhibits no anomalous properties or behaviors that warrant further containment.

SCP-1555's personality is characterized by its exceptional attention to detail and heightened observational skills. These attributes make SCP-1555 an expert gift-giving individual, as it can easily identify the perfect present for any occasion. However, SCP-1555's excessive perfectionism and anxiety around gift-giving tasks suggest deeper psychological issues that may require further investigation.

Addendum: SCP-1555 expressed an unusual interest in a Foundation-supplied shipment of new candy sticks. Researchers will continue to monitor the extent of SCP-1555's attachment to this accessory.  Any additional anomalous behaviors or requests from SCP-1555 should be promptly reported and evaluated.
