DSC-MATE-384, codenamed "The Fashionable Primate," is a male monkey of unknown origin with distinguishing red clown eyes and a frightened mouth. He is a successful fashion designer within the urban supernatural community, known for his eccentric and avant-garde designs that incorporate unique accents and accessories.

One of these accessories includes a distinctive LED gas mask that he wears during his public appearances. The outfit is completed with a hoodie and a two-color band on his forehead, signaling his current artistic inspiration.

Don't let his quirky appearance fool you, DSC-MATE-384 is an idealistic creature who strongly believes in making the world a better place. He fights for what he believes in, often leading protests or boycotting companies or causes that conflict with his values.

Assigning agents should be aware that he is unpredictable and sometimes fiercely protective of his designs. Clothes and fashion are a form of personal expression for him, and he will not hesitate to take action against anyone he deems to be "ruining" or "misusing" his creations.

Approach with caution and respect, as DSC-MATE-384 is a valuable asset to the foundation and the urban supernatural community. Any attempts to restrict his artistic expression may result in unforeseeable consequences with devastating effects.
