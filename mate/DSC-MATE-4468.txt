Item #: SCP-4468

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4468 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. They are to be equipped with a standard guard uniform, although their choker and cigarette must be confiscated. All interactions with SCP-4468 must be monitored and coordinated through the Site Director.

Description: SCP-4468 is a human female with a unique appearance. They have bright red clown eyes and purple lips, as well as a set of wings protruding from their blonde hair. In addition, they wear a red cross earring on their left ear.

SCP-4468 works as a security guard and is known for their quick wit and love of debate. They often engage in playful arguments with friends and family just for fun. However, their sarcastic and argumentative nature has led to conflicts in the workplace, and they have been reported for insubordination and verbal altercations with fellow guards.

When asked about their wings and other abnormal features, SCP-4468 becomes defensive and refuses to answer, claiming that it is a personal matter. Despite repeated attempts to extract information, SCP-4468 has yet to reveal the source of their abilities.

Addendum: SCP-4468's wings have been shown to have the ability to retract and extend at will. They have been observed to use them to escape from dangerous situations and to navigate rough terrain. Further research is needed to determine the full extent of their capabilities.
