Item #: SCP-5256

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5256 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times, with no less than two armed guards present at all times. Any personnel entering SCP-5256's chamber must wear Level A protective gear due to the potential toxic effects of SCP-5256's LED Gas Mask.

Description: SCP-5256 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 1 meter in height. SCP-5256 has red clown eyes with a two-color band across its forehead, and a pair of goggles situated on its forehead. SCP-5256 is typically adorned with a red scarf and an LED gas mask.

SCP-5256 possesses a unique personality that is both responsible and playful. SCP-5256 has been observed on multiple occasions bringing enjoyment to personnel by singing and dancing. However, it must be noted that SCP-5256 is considered a villain and has little respect for authority when it comes to its duties.

SCP-5256 is known to possess a strong sense of duty towards its mission, which is currently unknown by the Foundation. Despite this, SCP-5256's misguided pursuit of this mission has caused several incidents in the past, leading to the loss of civilian life.

It has been observed that SCP-5256's LED gas mask is capable of releasing a noxious gas when activated, rendering any nearby personnel unconscious. The exact composition of this gas is unknown, and testing has been restricted due to its lethal effects.

SCP-5256 is extremely agile and has been known to evade capture by leaping, jumping, and hopping around its opponents. Despite its playful demeanor, SCP-5256 is capable of inflicting lethal damage to its targets with its sharp teeth and claws.

Addendum: SCP-5256 was originally discovered after a series of bizarre burglaries in the city that left witnesses describing a rabbit-like creature wearing a gas mask. After the Foundation's intervention, SCP-5256 was contained, and its true nature was revealed. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of SCP-5256's fixation on its mission and the extent of its abilities.
