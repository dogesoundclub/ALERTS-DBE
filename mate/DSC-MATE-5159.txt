SCP-5159, also known as the "Emo Monkey Delivery Driver", is a male monkey species that stands at 3ft tall. 5159 sports a red beanie atop his head and an LED gas mask over his mouth. His frightened mouth and mysterious eyes that always seem to be hiding something add to his overall eerie appearance. 

Though its difficult to tell with the gas mask, 5159's eyes give the impression that he has seen some unimaginable horrors. Goggles attached on his forehead provide a clear view of upcoming obstacles when driving around the city.

Adding to his unique look, his ears adorned with gold earrings and a silver chain necklace is fastened around his neck. While all these features may seem overwhelming to some, that is just the surface level of this unique delivery driver.

SCP-5159's emotional nature is what sets him apart from the pack. For a monkey species, he is very in touch with his feelings and is not afraid to show them. He often finds himself engrossed in sad movies or music, even going as far as to cry over them. His soft and empathetic nature does not go unnoticed by those around him.

While being an enigma to most, SCP-5159 manages to keep a steady job as a delivery driver. His route covers most of the city which leads him towards different SCP Foundation sites but he never seems to be bothered by the presence or the contents within them. His emotional presence is always felt when he is carrying out his duties, and he has become quite popular among the other employees who admire his tender and emotional ways.

As to why such a creature exists in our realm, nobody knows. But those who come into contact with SCP-5159 seem to be confused by his existence yet almost comforted by his gentle nature. Further research is underway to understand the true nature of SCP-5159.
