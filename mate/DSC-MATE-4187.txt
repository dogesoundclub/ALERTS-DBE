SCP-4187, also known as "The Rabbit Don," is a notorious mafia boss who commands the respect of all those under his jurisdiction. Despite his seemingly harmless appearance as a rabbit, this creature is far from docile. The piercing, ski goggle-like eyes set in his not arranged green head betray a fierce intelligence and cunning that make him a force to be reckoned with.

Wearing a normal gas mask as his preferred accessory, SCP-4187 has an undeniable air of menace about him that intimidates even the toughest of adversaries. His impulsive nature and tendency to act on his emotions, however, can sometimes make him seem comical in certain situations. An action that would seem rash and dangerous to others might be seen as amusing or surprising when committed by this peculiar mob boss.

Maintaining control over his criminal enterprises with equal parts ruthlessness and whimsy, SCP-4187 is a force to be feared and respected in the urban underworld. Those foolish enough to cross him often find themselves facing dire consequences, but those smart enough to stay out of his way can be sure that this rabbit has a sense of humor that is not to be underestimated.
