Item #: SCP-5254

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5254 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with walls reinforced with 2-inch thick steel plating. Access to SCP-5254 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. The chamber must be inspected daily for any damage or attempts to escape.

Description: SCP-5254 is a male rabbit with VR Rainbow LED eyes, retro cap on its head, jade earring in its left ear, and a goggle on its forehead. It wears a silver chain around its neck and an LED gas mask that covers its nose and mouth. SCP-5254 stands 1.2 meters tall and weighs 20 kg. Its anomalous properties manifest as SCP-5254's ability to communicate using a combination of vocalizations and telepathy.

SCP-5254 is a curious individual with a penchant for obscure and esoteric topics. Its personality often leads SCP-5254 to randomly spout off facts and trivia to other individuals. SCP-5254 is also a skilled politician who has risen to power due to its persuasive abilities.

SCP-5254's abilities have raised concerns among the Foundation about its potential for influencing individuals with its persuasive abilities. Given its political position, SCP-5254 has access to vast resources and personnel that could pose a security threat to the Foundation's efforts to contain SCP-5254.

Addendum: Recent tests have shown that SCP-5254's persuasive abilities extend beyond verbal communication, with individuals who view photographs or video recordings of SCP-5254 also displaying a susceptibility to its persuasive abilities. The Foundation is currently exploring methods of limiting SCP-5254's influence on individuals outside of its containment cell.
