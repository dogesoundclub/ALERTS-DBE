SCP-7219, dubbed "The Political Primate", is a male monkey species with a distinguishable appearance. It is noted that SCP-7219 has blue clown eyes that contrast greatly against its green, unkept head. Additionally, this anomalous simian sports a pair of goggles fastened to its forehead and a single jade earring that dangles from its right ear.

In addition to its appearance, SCP-7219 is known for its eccentric and playful personality. Despite holding a position of power as a politician (an occupation that is unusual for an animal), SCP-7219 takes its duties and responsibilities very seriously. This sense of responsibility, mixed with its playful nature, has led to entertaining situations. SCP-7219 has been seen commanding a crowd's attention, getting everyone to dance and sing-along to its favorite tunes while never missing a beat.

The most distinctive accessory of SCP-7219 is its candy stick. This red and white striped treat serves as a prop for SCP-7219, and it is often seen carrying it in its mouth or using it as a tool to grab other objects.

SCP-7219 is currently under Foundation containment to prevent exposure to the public and understand the extent of its anomalous properties. Further research is necessary to understand the extent of its abilities and how they affect its behavior.
