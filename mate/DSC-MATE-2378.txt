Item #: 2378

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2378 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All cosmetic products, including hair dye and makeup, are prohibited within a 10-meter radius of SCP-2378’s containment area. Access to SCP-2378’s cell is granted only to personnel with Level 2 clearance or above.

Description: SCP-2378 is a human female who identifies herself as a beautician. SCP-2378's physical features include orange stripes on her face, purple lips, blue clown eyes, and a rainbow festival hairstyle. On her forehead, SCP-2378 wears a pair of goggles. She also possesses a pair of jade earrings and wears a normal gas mask as an accessory.

Despite her eccentric appearance, SCP-2378 remains calm and collected. However, she presents an idealistic attitude and strongly believes in making the world a better place. SCP-2378 may engage in protests or boycotts against causes and companies that she believes violate her values.

SCP-2378's anomalous properties manifest when she comes into contact with cosmetic products. Upon application, the products transform into anomalous creations that often have an unexpected result. Examples of this include:

When SCP-2378 applied hair dye, the hair color of the subject she was treating changed to a bright neon color. However, the hair continued to grow at an accelerated rate, resulting in the subject’s scalp becoming completely bald within three days.

When SCP-2378 applied lipstick, the subject’s lips transformed into a slimy texture, causing the individual to have difficulty speaking and breathing.

SCP-2378’s abilities are unpredictable, and it is essential to avoid contact with her if possible. SCP-2378 must be handled with extreme caution, and any cosmetic products found in her possession should be collected and disposed of immediately.

SCP-2378 was apprehended by the foundation after complaints of strange occurrences during beauty appointments. Her containment is necessary for public security, and any attempted escape must be dealt with immediately.

Addendum 2378-A: Despite efforts to persuade SCP-2378 to use her abilities in a controlled environment to create anomalous cosmetic products, SCP-2378 persistently refused citing ethical concerns. Drastic measures are not necessary, and current containment protocol must remain upheld.
