Description: Item #5268 is a human female of average height with short flowing black hair, adorned with a gold earring in each ear. The eyes of #5268 are of a unique VR jade LED color. They draw attention when surrounded by natural light that glows like an evergreen forest in a foggy night. 

The most notable feature of Item #5268 is her uncommonly striking red lips, accentuated with a black choker around her neck. The choker is a symbol of her fierce independence, as she is not one to ask for help or rely on others.

Personality: Item #5268 is an independent and self-reliant individual with a sense of humor. She has a strong sense of self and often refuses help, even in situations that may require assistance. Her stubbornness can lead to comical situations, such as attempting to move a heavy object alone or refusing to use a map when lost.

Despite her independent nature, Item #5268 has a strong moral code and a compassionate heart. As a veterinarian, she is dedicated to helping those in need and easing suffering, both human and animal alike. 

The Foundation believes that, with proper monitoring, Item #5268's independence and strong sense of morality can be utilized for the benefit of humanity.
