Item #: 354

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 354, also known as the "Enthusiast," must be kept in a hermetically sealed containment chamber at all times. Extreme caution must be exercised at all times when approaching and interacting with this entity. Personnel must not engage in any conversational exchanges with 354 in fear of being influenced by her charismatic and infectious personality.

Description: Subject 354 is a young Caucasian female with striking orange stripes on her face and red lips. Her eyes are a piercing shade of blue, reminiscent of a clown's, which may be related to her tendency to make people laugh with her spirited energy. Subject 354's head is unique with a set of wings that grow directly from her skull.

Personalit y: The Enthusiast has an infectious personality and an exceptional ability to influence others. It is said that she can turn the most ardent skeptic into a believer, merely by communicating her passion for something. The Enthusiast loves to get people excited, and this can sometimes lead to humorous situations, as she may become overly enthusiastic about something that others do not find as fascinating.

History: The origins of Subject 354 remain a mystery. Some speculate that the Enthusiast may have been born from the convergence of an angel and a demon, which would explain her unique physical appearance. The Enthusiast appears to thrive on the energy she gets from interacting with humans, and the Foundation is concerned that she may be working towards some dark and potentially devastating end.

Additional Notes: Subject 354 has been known to communicate through telekinesis, which may indicate some kind of psychic ability. 354's silver chain accessory is of unknown origin, but it seems to have some kind of significance to her. Those who come into contact with it often show signs of hypnosis and suggestibility, so it is advised that this accessory be kept away from any personnel.
