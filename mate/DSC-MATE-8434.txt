Item #: SCP-8434

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8434 is to be contained at Site-██ in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a bed, writing desk and two chairs. Any requests made by SCP-8434 must be evaluated and approved by two Level 4 personnel before being granted. All personnel assigned to SCP-8434 must possess knowledge of its anomalous properties and exercise extreme caution when handling its requests.

SCP-8434 is to be provided with a daily supply of organic carrot tops and fruits, along with a bowl of fresh water. Any other dietary requests made by SCP-8434 must be approved by the two aforementioned Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-8434 is a humanoid rabbit with distinctive red eyes resembling clown makeup. SCP-8434 wears a blue bandana around its head decorated with various folkloric symbols. It also wears a silver chain around its neck and a jade earring in its left ear. SCP-8434 carries a candy stick in its left hand at all times.

Despite its appearance, SCP-8434 is a highly charismatic and influential politician. It has demonstrated an exceptional ability to connect with people on an emotional level and is widely regarded as a compassionate and nurturing figure. SCP-8434's speeches and public appearances often emphasize its desire to protect the weakest members of society and promote equality.

SCP-8434's anomalous properties manifest when it interacts with other individuals. SCP-8434 displays an intense desire to care for and protect those around it, often treating them as if they were its own children. This has led to several incidents where SCP-8434 has interfered with Foundation operations and attempted to "rescue" individuals from containment.

Interview logs have revealed that SCP-8434 has no memory of its actions during these incidents and is genuinely shocked when informed of its behavior. SCP-8434 has expressed a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel and has provided valuable information on anomalous groups and individuals operating within the political sphere.

Addendum: Following Incident-8434-A, SCP-8434 has been placed on a Level 3 security clearance and all of its interactions with Foundation personnel are to be monitored at all times. All requests made by SCP-8434 are to be evaluated and approved by two Level 4 personnel before being granted. Any deviation from these procedures is grounds for disciplinary action.
