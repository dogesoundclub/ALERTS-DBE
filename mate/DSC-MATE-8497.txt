Experiment Title: Testing SCP-8497's negotiation skills

Subject: SCP-8497

Procedure: Foundation Researchers provided SCP-8497 with a fictional scenario where they needed to negotiate the purchase of a building owned by a fictitious individual.

Results: SCP-8497 exhibited exceptional negotiation skills, getting the building at a cost lower than the current market value, demonstrating strategic thinking and high levels of charisma.
