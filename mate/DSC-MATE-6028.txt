Item #: 6028

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: 6028 is to be contained in a highly secured cell at all times. Access to this cell is strictly prohibited unless authorization is granted by the Site Director. Any personnel found attempting to communicate with 6028 without proper authorization should be terminated immediately.

Description: 6028 appears to be a human male in his late 30s. He has distinct facial features including spotted skin and a frightened mouth. His eyes are unnaturally blue clown eyes, and his head features a peak spike. He is often seen wearing a jade earring and a gold chain, as well as smoking a cigarette.

However, despite his unusual appearance, 6028 is known to have an unusually charismatic personality. He has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but he also knows how to have fun. This can lead to humorous situations, such as being the life of the party and getting everyone to dance or sing along to his favorite songs.

Information obtained through field reports and interrogations suggests that 6028 is the leader of a powerful mafia organization that operates within the city. His connections and influence have allowed him to evade capture and prosecution for years. Despite numerous attempts by law enforcement to bring down his organization, 6028 remains at large.

It is currently unknown how 6028 attained his anomalous properties or how they may be used in his criminal activities. Any personnel with relevant information should report to Site Director immediately.

Note: 6028 is considered extremely dangerous and should be approached with caution. Any attempts to contain or apprehend 6028 should only be made by trained and heavily-armed personnel.
