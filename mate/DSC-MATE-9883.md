Item #: 9883

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be confined in a standard containment chamber at all times when not on duty. The chamber is to be outfitted with a Soprano-class dampening field, to prevent any escape attempts. Due to his role as a vital member of the transit system, regular well-being checks and general maintenance should be performed on Subject to ensure his continued effectiveness in his job.

Description: Subject is a male rabbit of the lagomorph species known for being introspective, with thickset blue fur, a blue bandana around the head, and a striking pair of blue clown eyes. A gold chain is also seen around the neck for decorative purposes. While in captivity, this entity can be seen frequently lost in thought, engaging in what appears to be daydreaming. This has resulted in unexpected amusing moments, as Subject has been known to walk into poles or trip over objects while lost in thought.

While it would appear that the entity is mindful of its abilities, intelligence-wise, it fluctuates in behavior. Subject can be refractory during containment periods, and struggle against attempts at interaction; alternatively, they can be cooperative and considerate. Staff should take note that the subject can be easily agitated if disturbed from its thoughts.

Subject's purpose is that of a train driver, stationed in the city's transit system, and as such is a vital member of the public transportation system. Subject displays no anomalous attributes when performing said functions; however, it is in the entity's off time that its behavior becomes erratic, hence the reason for these containment procedures.

Addendum: It is requested that the head of containment take note of the necessity of maintaining Subject's employment as a train driver. While his behavior remains unpredictable at times, Subject has shown to be essential in the smooth running of the city's transit system, and attempts to replace him with another driver have been met with significant opposition.
