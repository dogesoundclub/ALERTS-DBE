Item #: 9213

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9213 is to be kept under constant surveillance while in her political position. Any abnormal behavior is to be reported to the local Task Force for further investigation. SCP-9213 is aware of the Foundation's existence, and under normal circumstances, is not to be approached.

Description: SCP-9213 appears to be a human female, with a striking resemblance to a politician. The subject's face is adorned with red lipstick, which complements her VR jade LED eyes. Her head is shaved with a rainbow festival motif, and she sports green cross earrings. SCP-9213 is often seen wearing a silver chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-9213's personality is characterized by impulsive behavior, often resulting in her taking risks on a whim. This can lead to unusual or humorous situations, like jumping off cliffs into bodies of water. SCP-9213 is also prone to making rash decisions and is easily influenced by others.

Despite these traits, SCP-9213 is highly social and charismatic, which allows her to maintain a successful political career. However, her erratic behavior has raised concerns in the Foundation due to potential security breaches.

Addendum: Dr. ████ has proposed that SCP-9213 undergo psychological counseling to curb her impulsive behavior. The proposal is under review at this time.
