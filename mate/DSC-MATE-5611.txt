Item #: SCP-5611

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5611 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must have a minimum size of 10 meters by 10 meters by 3 meters and be equipped with a high-strength titanium alloy door. SCP-5611 has expressed a fondness for adventure and may attempt to escape containment. Thus, two armed guards must be stationed at all times outside of SCP-5611's containment chamber.

Description: SCP-5611 is a male tiger of Bengal subspecies with unusual cybernetic implants. The most notable among them being its VR jade LED eyes, which glows in a calming green color. SCP-5611's head is adorned with green hair and a purple cap. It wears a red cross earring, a gold chain, and a cigarette dangling between its feline jaws.

SCP-5611 possesses a humanoid form, with a height of 1.8 meters and a weight of approximately 150 kilograms. The cybernetic enhancements on SCP-5611's body allow it to operate vintage and modern technological devices with ease. It has also displayed proficiency in programming tasks, indicating that it might have received education in computer science.

SCP-5611's personality can be described as adventurous and risk-taking. It takes delight in trying new things, even if they may be dangerous. Agents have reported SCP-5611 telling humorous stories about its numerous near-death experiences while bungee jumping, skydiving, or exploring abandoned places with its colleagues. SCP-5611 tends to be affable and approachable to people who share its passion for living life to the fullest. However, it can become restless and agitated if kept in confinement for an extended period.

Addendum: Following incident 5611-A, experimentation with SCP-5611 is strictly prohibited without express permission from Senior Researcher D█████. SCP-5611 is to be sedated and restrained whenever it needs to be transported outside of its containment chamber. Any researchers who wish to study SCP-5611's cybernetic implants must undergo Level-4 Security Clearance and receive cybernetic implants themselves for compatibility reasons.
