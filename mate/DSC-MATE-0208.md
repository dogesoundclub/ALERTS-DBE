Item #: 208

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-208 is to be allowed to live a normal life as a reporter, as long as it does not bring attention to the Foundation or its activities. Any information that DSC-MATE-208 may have that could compromise Foundation secrecy is to be carefully scrubbed from its records.

Description: DSC-MATE-208 is a male human with a mouth spot and frightened mouth. Its eyes resemble ski goggles, and its head is made of a powerful yet lightweight metal in a shade of purple. It wears a medical mask over its mouth, and has a jade earring in each ear. DSC-MATE-208 also wears a gold chain as an accessory.

This anomaly possesses a very nurturing side, showing intense care for even inanimate objects. Reports indicate that it often gives names to its car, talks to its plants, and anthropomorphizes household appliances. These tendencies are not considered dangerous and do not require intervention at this time.

DSC-MATE-208 is a reporter and has easy access to information. The Foundation must monitor its activity closely, to ensure that it not gain any information that could compromise Foundation operations. While not a direct threat, its insatiable curiosity could be a liability.

Note: DSC-MATE-208 has proven useful in the monitoring of supernatural activities, showing a willingness to furnish the Foundation with leads and information. As such, we have decided to leave it free on the condition it does not share any information about the Foundation's operations. -O5-â–ˆ
