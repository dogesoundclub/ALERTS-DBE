Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5947 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber is to be maintained at a temperature of no less than 25Â°C to ensure the comfort and well-being of DSC-MATE-5947. A supply of cigarettes is to be provided to DSC-MATE-5947 on a regular basis, as failing to do so will result in irritability and aggression.

DSC-MATE-5947 portrays a strong sense of independence, often preferring to handle situations on its own rather than seeking assistance from others.
