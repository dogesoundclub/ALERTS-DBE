SCP-5738, also known as "Rabbi", is a peculiar humanoid that works as a fast food worker in a popular chain restaurant. It appears to be a human female with pink rabbit features on her head, including long ears and fur. Her most noticeable feature is the presence of spots on her face, a rare genetic mutation that she inherited from her rabbit ancestors. 

Despite the unusual appearance, SCP-5738 seems to be able to function normally and carries out its work duties without any issues. However, it tends to wear a medical mask at all times, presumably to avoid any unwanted attention or scrutiny from customers. 

SCP-5738's personality is characterized by an analytical and logical mindset, often finding joy in debating and arguing with others over trivial topics. This personality trait has led to some humorous situations, and its coworkers often find themselves amused by SCP-5738's sharp wit and dry humor. 

SCP-5738 also wears a gold earring on one of its rabbit ears and a choker, a common accessory among the human population. These may serve as a means to blend in with humans more effectively or simply as a personal preference. 

Further analysis and observation of SCP-5738 may be necessary to determine the extent of its anomalous properties and whether they pose any threats to the general public. Until then, it will remain under close monitoring and custody by the SCP Foundation.
