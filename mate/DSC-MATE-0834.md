Description:

Subject 834 is a male Monkey of unknown subspecies, with a distinct feature of a frightened mouth set on a head of unarranged green fur. The subject's normal glasses were noted as noteworthy features, but the most prominent feature is the two-color band on the forehead, which drives attention to them. 

Subject 834 is not hostile, but it exuded an air of tension and paranoia ever since being contained. Whenever he's conversing with personnel, he often frets about certain details or shades of phrases that immediately triggers obsessive thoughts. We observed that the monkey is discrete of the surroundings when there is too much clutter and disorganization. 

He can often be found gazing at the screens, processing the newscasts and writing lines, each meticulously combed over for the correct words and vocal inflections. His attention to detail is extraordinary, and this trait bleeds into his daily life, from assembling a flashy gold chain to organizing his wardrobe in color codes.

Although seemingly innocuous, we must exercise caution with regards to his obsession to not let it devolve into a full-blown compulsion. Any sudden intervention in his rigid routines could potentially exacerbate any possible comorbid conditions. Researchers are advised to avoid abrupt actions that could cause any subject damage, either physical or mental.
