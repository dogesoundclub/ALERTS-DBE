Item #: 9746

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9746 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No personnel are to interact with SCP-9746 without approved clearance from at least two Level-3 personnel. Access to SCP-9746's containment chamber is only allowed through a secure airlock system.

Description: SCP-9746 appears as a female human, with orange stripes on their face, and red clown-like eyes. SCP-9746 has a smile on their face almost constantly, and is usually found wearing a bucket hat with goggles on their forehead, a gold chain necklace, and often seen smoking a cigarette. Despite their somewhat comical appearance, SCP-9746 should be considered highly dangerous.

SCP-9746 is an ambitious and goal-oriented individual that often takes on tasks that are beyond the capabilities of regular humans. However, SCP-9746's excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking allow them to complete the tasks they take on. SCP-9746 is highly motivated and focused on achieving their goals, even if it means putting themselves and others in danger.

SCP-9746 was discovered working as an electrician in [REDACTED], where they were able to gain access to sensitive areas due to their position. SCP-9746's abilities were noticed by Foundation operatives, who captured and contained them.

SCP-9746's abilities are currently unknown, but it is believed that they possess the ability to manipulate electricity in some way. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of SCP-9746's abilities.

Addendum: SCP-9746 has shown a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel and has expressed a desire to use their abilities for the betterment of humanity. However, due to the potential danger SCP-9746 poses, interaction with SCP-9746 must be limited and heavily monitored.
