SCP-777 or commonly referred to as "The Mafia Boss" is a female human with distinct orange stripes on her face and a smile that can make anyone feel uneasy. Her eyes are a bright shade of orange and her head is always covered with a retro cap. SCP-777 is often seen wearing a gas mask that is found to be quite normal in design. 

SCP-777's forehead is marked with a goggle, which seems to be purely decorative. Furthering her unique look, she has red cross earrings that she wears on both ears. Despite her intimidating appearance, SCP-777 is known for having a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. She delivers deadpan jokes, which can be surprisingly funny for the ones who manage to understand them. 

SCP-777's personality is a blend of charisma and mysteriousness that allure many to her. She is highly intelligent, manipulative, and has an enigmatic aura that instills fear in those who cross her path. Her sharp wit and authoritative presence are enough to make her subordinates do whatever she wishes. 

SCP-777 is known to be the leader of a powerful Mafia organization that remains shrouded in secrecy. Her influence is widespread in cities across the world, and many believe that she is the mastermind behind several criminal operations. There is very little information available about the Mafia Boss, and those who dare to cross her end up facing dire consequences.
