Item #: 7510

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7510 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell must be equipped with a computer and internet access, as DSC-MATE-7510 requires access to technology for work purposes.

Description: DSC-MATE-7510 is a female humanoid with distinctive orange stripes on their face. DSC-MATE-7510 also possesses orange eyebrow eyes and sports a purple cap with attached headset on their head, as well as a jade earring in either ear. DSC-MATE-7510's personality is highly detail-oriented, at times even obsessive, with color-coding their closet and alphabetizing their spice rack.

While DSC-MATE-7510's appearance is humanoid, it is important to note that they possess a heightened technological aptitude, holding the title of programmer in their former life.
