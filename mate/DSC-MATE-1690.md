Any spontaneous or risky behavior must be reported immediately to the Site Director. Subject 1690 is not to be allowed access to any DSCs or anomalous objects under any circumstances.

Description: Subject 1690 is a female human with unique facial features. She has spots on her face and wears bright red lipstick. She wears normal glasses and a purple cap with a headset. She also has an earring in the shape of a red cross and wears a silver chain around her neck. Subject 1690 often smokes cigarettes as a stress-relieving mechanism.

Personality: Subject 1690 has a very spontaneous personality and enjoys taking risks and doing things on a whim. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river. However, this behavior can also be potentially dangerous and harmful, as Subject 1690 may not consider the consequences of her actions. It is essential to monitor her closely and prevent her from engaging in any risky behavior. 

Subject 1690 has experience as a veterinarian, and her medical knowledge makes her a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, her unpredictable personality and tendency to take risks mean that she cannot be trusted with significant responsibilities or access to any anomalous objects.
