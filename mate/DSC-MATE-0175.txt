Item #: 175

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 175, known as "the Banker", is to be allowed free movement and permitted to continue their daily routine, as long as they do not exhibit any disturbing behaviors. Monitoring their bank account and transaction activities is required to ensure no illicit actions are taken.

Description:
The Banker, identified as a human male, possesses distinct facial features. Their face is marked with orange stripes, resembling those of a tiger. In contrast, their eyes are protected with ski goggles, possibly due to photosensitivity or injury. A constant smile graces their features, indicating a friendly disposition. Their head is adorned with a red beanie, which is worn regardless of the weather.

While the clothing and face may be unusual, it is the accessory that has caught the attention of the Foundation. The Banker consistently wears a silver chain, which seems to have no significant function beyond simple adornment.

Personality:
The Banker's personality is notable in that they show a high degree of empathy towards inanimate objects. This behavior leads to giving names to significant possessions such as cars or furniture, as though they were sentient beings. Reports have said that this nurturing behavior can be extended to even plants and household appliances.

Having grown-up interacting with material objects in a personified manner, the Banker often maintains these tendencies. Though odd, this behavior is not considered harmful, and has not interfered with their ability to perform their job as a banker.

Additional Notes:
Subject 175 shows no propensity towards violence or illicit activities, and has not caused any problems while working at the local bank. Due to the nature of their unique behaviors, staff interacting with the Banker are advised to remain sensitive and respectful of these quirks while conducting business.
