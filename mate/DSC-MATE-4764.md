Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4764 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber should be regularly inspected to ensure that all components of Item 4764 are functioning properly. Access to Item 4764 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: Item 4764 is a male robotic veterinarian with a somewhat scatterbrained personality. His face features a single green cyclops eye, and is typically accessorized with a blue bandana, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask. Though capable of functioning autonomously, Item 4764 has the capacity to interact with human beings through a series of programmed responses.

Despite his professional training, Item 4764's tendency to forget things and become sidetracked can lead to problematic situations. When placed in unfamiliar settings, Item 4764 may become lost or disoriented, possibly creating a risk to human safety. However, Item 4764's humorous quirks and compassionate personality make him a valuable asset to any team in need of specialized veterinary care.

Addendum: Due to his unique set of skills, Item 4764 has been requested for a special mission involving the rehabilitation of a group of rare, endangered animals. This mission has been approved by the O5 Council and will be carried out under the supervision of a Level 3 researcher.
