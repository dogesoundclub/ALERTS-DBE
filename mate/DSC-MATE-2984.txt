Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2984 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with access to high-protein food and water. The chamber must be equipped with a sturdy lock and reinforced latches, as SCP-2984 has demonstrated significant strength and agility in past attempts to escape. Any staff members entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear, including gloves and face masks, to prevent exposure to SCP-2984's anomalous effects.

SCP-2984's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility, coupled with a playful sense of humor. It often seeks social interaction and has been observed being the life of the party, encouraging everyone to dance and sing along to its favorite songs.
