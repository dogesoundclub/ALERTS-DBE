Item #: 6680

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6680 is to be kept in a specialized containment chamber at Site-19. Should 6680 attempt to escape, security personnel are authorized to use non-lethal force to subdue and return it to containment. Medical examinations are necessary once a month to ensure 6680's physical and mental well-being.

Description: 6680 is an anomalous humanoid creature identified as a monkey. It is approximately 3 feet tall and weighs roughly 100 pounds. 6680 has distinctive red clown eyes and a unique mohawk on its head. It also wears a gold chain around its neck as an accessory.

6680 has a remarkable degree of curiosity about the world around it and is motivated by a desire to learn about obscure and unusual topics. This can sometimes lead to humorous situations as it randomly spouts off obscure facts or trivia to its fellow captives or guards. Please note that 6680's highly curious nature makes it difficult to predict its behavior which can often times be erratic and unpredictable.

Additional information: 6680's anomalous properties have been observed to occasionally cause unpredictable effects in its environment. Furthermore, it has an extraordinary capacity for mimicking sounds which can aid it in escaping its confinement.

Addendum 6680-1: After a recent escape attempt, 6680 has demonstrated heightened levels of intelligence and cognitive abilities. Therefore, Site-19's research division has recommended that further testing be conducted to assess 6680's intelligence and other cognitive capabilities.
