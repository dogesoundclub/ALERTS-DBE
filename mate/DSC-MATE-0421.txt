Item #: SCP-421

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-421 is currently contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. As a precaution, a normal gas mask is to be worn by any personnel who come in contact with SCP-421 outside of testing. SCP-421 is not to be allowed access to any duct tape or paper clips without level 3 clearance.

Description: SCP-421 is a human female, identified as a lawyer prior to containment. SCP-421 exhibits unusual physical features, including orange stripes on her face, red clown eyes, a forehead with a two color band, and red cross earrings. SCP-421 also wears a gold chain as a common accessory.

SCP-421's anomalous ability manifests in her tendency to use unconventional and hands-on approaches to problem-solving. She has been observed using duct tape and paper clips to fix broken objects, as well as rigging makeshift solutions to complex problems. In rare cases, SCP-421 has also demonstrated the ability to generate small amounts of electrical energy to power her devices.

SCP-421's personality is practical, no-nonsense, and goal-oriented. She is both resourceful and adaptable in various situations. SCP-421 tends to disregard the safety risks of her unconventional methods, which has led to several incidents resulting in minor injury to herself and others.

Addendum: SCP-421's previous occupation as a lawyer suggests that her anomalous ability may have been responsible for her success and reputation, although this remains uncertain. Further testing is required to fully understand the nature and scope of SCP-421's abilities.
