Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1671 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-1671 is allowed only for research purposes with the prior written permission of at least one Level 4 personnel. Any communication with SCP-1671 requires monitoring by security personnel.

SCP-1671's job as an electrician has been suspended indefinitely. SCP-1671 is to be provided with basic necessities and needs, as well as any other reasonable requirements. SCP-1671 has shown a fondness for books and is to be provided with reading materials. Any object or items gifted to SCP-1671 are to be thoroughly screened before allowing them into SCP-1671's containment chamber.

Description: SCP-1671 appears to be a human male in his late 30s. SCP-1671 has orange stripes on his facial features and wears retro glasses and a cap. Strangely, SCP-1671's glasses appear to have an anomalous property that helps SCP-1671 understand highly complex electrical systems seemingly at will.

SCP-1671's personality is very nurturing and caring. This personality trait could lead to humorous situations where SCP-1671 takes care of its colleagues as if they were their own children. This is a common behavior observed among individuals with highly developed parental instincts. SCP-1671 shows no resistance to containment procedures and is highly cooperative.

Addendum 1: SCP-1671's anomalous properties were first discovered when working on a high-power transmission line when SCP-1671 demonstrated an abnormal ability to parse highly complex electrical systems. This ability allowed SCP-1671 to identify and fix a fault that had gone unnoticed for months.

Addendum 2: SCP-1671 is a highly prized addition to the Foundation's technological division, and the SCP Foundation encourages all staff to ensure SCP-1671's mental and physical well-being.
