Item #: SCP-478

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-478 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. As SCP-478's anomalous traits are highly visible, security personnel are advised to keep all interactions with SCP-478 brief, professional, and non-disruptive. SCP-478 is to be provided with suitable clothing, hygiene products, and entertainment materials, within reason.

Description: SCP-478 is a human female of average height and weight. SCP-478's most striking features are her blue clown eyes and spotted facial skin. SCP-478's head is adorned with a bright purple cap, under which she maintains green hair. SCP-478's forehead features two colored bands and a goggle attached at the center, which she uses intermittently for vision purposes. SCP-478 often wears a medical mask over her mouth and a choker around her neck.

SCP-478's anomalous traits manifest primarily in social situations. SCP-478 has a natural charm and charisma that can quickly endear her to others. SCP-478 is capable of making others laugh with ease, often by telling jokes, doing silly dances or making outrageous statements. SCP-478's humor can have a profound psychological effect on those around her, lowering inhibitions and increasing suggestibility. 

SCP-478 has caused several containment breaches and significant security breaches by exploiting her charm to coerce personnel into providing her with restricted items, access to unauthorized areas, and allowing her to leave her containment cell unauthorized. Upon recapture, SCP-478 expressed no malicious intent and appears to be genuinely remorseful for the actions that led to her containment breaches.

Addendum: As of ██/██/████, SCP-478 has been transferred to Site-17 for testing in the newly created Laugh Factory, where its anomalous effect on human psychology can be studied in greater detail. Access to SCP-478 requires Level 3 clearance and prior approval from two Level 3 personnel.
