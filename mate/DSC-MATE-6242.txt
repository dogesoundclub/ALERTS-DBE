Item #: 6242

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6242 is to be monitored by a team of trained professionals at all times. Under no circumstances may he be allowed to operate an automobile without proper supervision. In the event of a crisis or natural disaster, 6242 may be called upon to assist in traffic control, but only with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: 6242 is a male Bengal tiger standing at approximately 6'5" tall in his bipedal form. His fur is primarily orange and black, with white stripes along his back and legs. He is often seen wearing a purple cap with green hair, a red scarf, and glasses that he has adapted to fit his head shape. On his forehead, there is a two-color band that seems to be some form of tribal tattoo.

Personality: 6242 has been known to be somewhat impulsive at times, often jumping headfirst into situations without fully considering the consequences. He can also be quite egotistical, which has led to several incidents where he has shown off or tried to impress others with his driving skills, often resulting in minor accidents. However, he has shown remorse for his mistakes and has been cooperative with containment efforts.

Additional notes: 6242 is an anomaly in that he initially appeared as a feral creature before unexpectedly adopting a human-like form. It is unknown if other tigers possess similar abilities or if 6242 himself had undergone some kind of transformation. Further research is needed.
