Item #: DSC-MATE-7161

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7161 is to be kept under regular surveillance in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Outside of mandated security escort, no individual with a history of mental illness or instability is to be allowed within 10 meters of DSC-MATE-7161. All interactions with DSC-MATE-7161 must take place at a distance of no less than 3 meters. In the event that DSC-MATE-7161 experiences a sudden behavioral shift or alteration, contact Dr. ███████ immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-7161 is a human female identified as a 00s schoolgirl with spots on the face and purple lips. DSC-MATE-7161's eyes are red and have been compared to the makeup of classic clown performers. The most notable feature, however, is a red cross earring worn on the left earlobe. The shape of the earring has been reported to undergo changes that appear entirely impossible. DSC-MATE-7161 is a reliable and organized individual, though stubborn and set in her ways. She has difficulty adapting to changes and tends to follow a strict routine. DSC-MATE-7161's stubbornness is sometimes the cause of humorous situations when she struggles with unexpected challenges.

Addendum: Dr. M. ███████ requested an interview with DSC-MATE-7161 during her routine monthly visit, at which time DSC-MATE-7161 demonstrates a significant shift in personality that may require adjustments to our containment procedures.
