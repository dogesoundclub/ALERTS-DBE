Item #: DSC-MATE-5810

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5810 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel are not allowed to make direct eye contact with DSC-MATE-5810 unless given permission by Level 3 security staff. Requests for interaction with DSC-MATE-5810 should be made no less than 24 hours in advance.

Description: DSC-MATE-5810, also known by its alias 'the Mechanic,' is a human male standing at 1.83 meters in height, weighing approximately 80 kilograms. DSC-MATE-5810 displays no anomalous physical characteristics, save for its jade earring on the left ear, a silver chain around its neck, and a cigarette perpetually in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-5810's personality is the primary source of its anomalous properties. It displays a strong and decisive personality, often viewed as bossy and intimidating by others, despite its cooperation with Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-5810's unyielding focus and drive to complete its job efficiently and effectively has proven useful in completing maintenance operations on other DSC objects. However, it is still recommended to interact with DSC-MATE-5810 with caution as it has been known to lash out at personnel who it perceives as uncooperative.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5810 has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation's ongoing efforts. However, personnel are urged to keep any personal interaction with DSC-MATE-5810 to a minimum, given its unpredictable temperament.
