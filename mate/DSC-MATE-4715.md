Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4715 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished to their personal preferences. Access to electronic devices and communications is to be strictly monitored and controlled.

Description: DSC-MATE-4715 is a male real estate agent of the human species and displays characteristics of natural born leadership, often taking charge of situations. They are easily identifiable by their orange-striped face and police cap, as well as the VR Jade LED eyes and gold chain accessory they wear.

DSC-MATE-4715's abilities extend beyond their charismatic personality, as they possess an anomalous property where their commands become nearly irresistible to anyone who hears them. This ability is activated when they wear their police cap and begin giving orders, causing those within range to follow them unconditionally.

DSC-MATE-4715's capabilities have been observed in a range of scenarios, from commanding entire crowds to follow them through dangerous situations, to gaining control over small groups for their own personal gain.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4715 has been deemed a valuable asset to the Foundation's containment and diplomacy efforts. As such, their containment procedure includes access to electronic devices for communication purposes, subject to monitoring and approval by Foundation personnel. Any requests or demands made by DSC-MATE-4715 should be carefully scrutinized before being granted.
