Item #: SCP-5503

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5503 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to technology must be severely restricted, and internet activities are to be monitored and restricted.

Description: SCP-5503 is a humanoid female with features resembling that of an 00s school girl. One of its most distinct features is a set of purple lips. SCP-5503 also has a silver chain accessory, jade earrings, and wears a set of goggles on its forehead.

SCP-5503's personality has been described as reckless, showing a tendency to impulsively act before thinking things through. These traits often lead to humorous situations and minor mishaps when trying to impress others. SCP-5503 is a skilled programmer, and often uses technology to carry out its impulsive actions.

SCP-5503's actions appear to be unpredictable and vary in intensity. When not kept in check, it can cause severe damage to both itself and those surrounding it. SCP-5503 has shown no signs of malevolent intent towards the Foundation, but caution is still advised when dealing with its requests and demands.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5503's ability to bypass security measures and network restrictions, personnel are advised to be vigilant in monitoring its activities. Any unauthorized online access or communication by SCP-5503 must be reported immediately to the Site Director.
