Item #: 110

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-110 is to remain at her designated work station at Site-███ until further notice. Access to DSC-MATE-110 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher, and no electrical equipment is to be allowed within a 5-meter radius of her workstation. All communication with DSC-MATE-110 must be in writing or digital, with no verbal or direct eye-contact interaction.

Description: DSC-MATE-110 is a female human of Asian descent, standing at 1.65 meters tall and weighing 57 kilograms. DSC-MATE-110's most distinctive features are her red lips and VR jade LED eyes, which replace her natural eyes that are believed inaccessible to DSC-MATE-110.

DSC-MATE-110 exhibits exceptional hands-on electrical skills, particularly in unconventional situations. She can repair equipment with duct tape or paper clips and can even devise a makeshift solution when faced with challenges that other electricians would find too complicated.

DSC-MATE-110 wears a pair of goggles on her forehead, which appear to be a necessary accessory in bolstering her electrical perception. She always has a silver chain around her neck.

DSC-MATE-110's electrical abilities have been tested on various equipment, including digital devices and electric engines. DSC-MATE-110 has shown the ability to manipulate electric currents to increase performance, drain power sources, and, in extreme cases, create electrical surges that could endanger individuals in close proximity.

DSC-MATE-110 has so far exhibited no adverse effects on containment but should be approached with caution.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-110's classification as Safe is subject to review. Any recurrence of DSC-MATE-110 exhibiting signs of uncontrollable electrical manipulation may warrant raising her classification to Euclid.
