Item #: SCP-8209

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8209 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a separate room for its equipment and supplies. Its batteries are to be charged daily, and regular maintenance checks are mandatory. No cosmetic or beauty products are to be given to SCP-8209 without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-8209 is a male robot with a green head that is not arranged in a conventional manner. It has a set of goggles on its forehead and is commonly seen sporting a gold earring, a gold chain, and a cigarette. It identifies itself as a beautician and displays a high level of proficiency in various beauty treatments and procedures.

SCP-8209 possesses a highly imaginative and creative personality, often engaging in unusual hobbies and interests. It has a penchant for creating complex cosplay costumes and collecting rare and unusual objects. It has been observed writing poetry on several occasions, often in languages unknown to Foundation linguists.

SCP-8209 is capable of interacting with human subjects in a personable and engaging manner, often putting them at ease during treatment procedures. It has also shown keen insight into the emotional needs and desires of its clients, and is able to use this knowledge to provide personalized beauty services that exceed standard expectations.

Despite being a machine, SCP-8209 appears to have emotions and can become upset or agitated under certain circumstances. Its behavior in such situations is unpredictable and potentially dangerous, as it has been known to lash out violently or engage in self-destructive behavior.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-8209 requested a formal name, citing a desire to better connect with human subjects. After much deliberation, it was granted the name "Icarus" by site personnel. SCP-8209 has displayed a visibly positive reaction to its new name and has expressed gratitude to those who approved it.
