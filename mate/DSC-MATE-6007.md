Item #: 6007

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6007 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, modified to include a variety of monkey-friendly amenities such as swings, climbing structures, and plenty of bananas. They are to be fed a balanced diet and provided with regular medical check-ups by a licensed veterinarian.

Description: Subject 6007 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing approximately three feet tall when upright. Their eyes are notable for their ski goggle-like appearance, which glows faintly when they are experiencing strong emotions. They also display a perpetually frightened expression, with their mouth perpetually agape as if they are perpetually surprised.

Despite their appearance, they are a highly capable veterinarian, able to diagnose and treat a wide variety of animal ailments. They display a strong sense of duty and responsibility, with a tendency to take on more tasks than they can effectively manage. This often leads to humorous situations, such as trying to carry too many things at once or falling asleep mid-task due to exhaustion.

Subject 6007 has demonstrated high levels of intelligence, capable of understanding and responding to complex instructions in several languages. However, they are prone to sudden mood swings and can become easily overwhelmed by stress.

Addendum: The Foundation has acquired Subject 6007 from an undisclosed source. Further research is ongoing to determine the extent of their abilities and the source of their unusual appearance.
