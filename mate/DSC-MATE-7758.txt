Item #: SCP-7758

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7758 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. As a tiger in the guise of a banker, SCP-7758 has the ability to manipulate financial markets and engage in fraudulent activities. Personnel working with SCP-7758 in any capacity are to be vetted for any potential biases or insider knowledge. SCP-7758's living quarters are to be decorated with traditional items from their culture for psychological support.

Description: SCP-7758 is a tiger-humanoid hybrid, with fur covering their body and a humanoid head with a jade earring in each ear. The glasses SCP-7758 wears are only for their human guise and are not necessary for their tiger form. SCP-7758 typically adorns a gold chain around their neck as a symbol of status as a banker. SCP-7758's fur is noted to be a green color, not commonly found amongst tigers in the wild.

SCP-7758 has a very traditional mindset and often takes pride in their cultural heritage. However, SCP-7758 also possesses a playful side, which can be displayed through humorous storytelling and practical jokes. This behavior sets SCP-7758 apart from other tigers and gives them an uncanny ability to blend in with human society.

SCP-7758 has displayed an ability to manipulate financial markets successfully, making them a significant potential threat. Though they claim to have no malicious intentions, personnel at Site-██ are to monitor SCP-7758's activities closely. Attempts to utilize SCP-7758's ability in a controlled manner for financial benefit are currently under investigation.

Addendum: SCP-7758 has expressed an interest in traditional tiger folklore and has requested access to literary materials. This request is to be granted at the discretion of Site Command, as it could potentially aid in SCP-7758's mental well-being as well as provide insights into their cultural traditions.
