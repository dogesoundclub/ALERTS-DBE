Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5499 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a minimum size of 6 square meters. The chamber must be furnished with basic necessities and food. Any form of physical contact with SCP-5499 must be strictly avoided. Video and audio monitoring of the chamber should be active at all times.

Description: SCP-5499 is a male rabbit humanoid with red clown eyes. SCP-5499 doesn’t demonstrate any anomalous abilities, but exhibits a peculiar personality that can affect individuals in its proximity. SCP-5499's head is not arranged in a green color pattern, and a victory band of red color is visible on his forehead. SCP-5499 is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5499 is a fast food worker at a local diner in ████████, Arizona. They have a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard, often delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. Despite being a fast food worker, SCP-5499 is observed to show proficiency in cooking and has been noted to prepare gourmet dishes.

SCP-5499's proximity can cause an effect on people and animals, inducing a sense of humor similar to the SCP-5499's dry sense. This effect can last for up to 24 hours, depending on the distance between SCP-5499 and the affected individual. The anomalous effect is less effective on individuals with prior exposure to SCP objects.

Addendum: SCP-5499 was discovered when several reports of strange occurrences surfaced following SCP-5499's arrival at ██████ Fast Food Diner. These reports include customers and employees exhibiting unusual behavior like sudden laughter, smiling for no apparent reason, and even developing a sense of humor. A Mobile Task Force was dispatched, and SCP-5499 was taken into custody.

SCP-5499 has shown no signs of aggression, and cooperation is occasional. However, it is advised to maintain standard containment procedures due to SCP-5499's potential to affect individuals' behavior.
