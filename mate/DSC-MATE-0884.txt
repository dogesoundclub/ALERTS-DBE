SCP-884, codenamed "The Dancing Doctor," is a human male whose physical appearance is marked by a distinctive Mouth Spot. He appears as a Monk, with a Goggle on his forehead, and a Green Cross Earring on either ear.

Despite his serious, professional demeanor as a Doctor, SCP-884 possesses an uncommonly lighthearted and jovial personality. He takes his duties and responsibilities seriously, but knows how to unwind and let loose when the situation calls for it. It is said that he is often found on the dance floor at social events, surprising and amusing others with his slick dance moves and silly antics.

SCP-884's humorous behavior may be indicative of an anomalous cognitive or emotional state, though researchers have not determined a specific cause for his personality traits. As such, personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-884, and avoid engaging him in situations that may trigger his humorous behavior.
