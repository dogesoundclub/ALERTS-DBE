Item #: 4163

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4163 is to be monitored at all times, and all communication must be done through secure channels. Any attempts to contact the subject outside of designated channels are strictly prohibited. Subject 4163 is to be provided with any necessary physical or psychological support. Access to any technology beyond standard equipment is to be prohibited without approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 4163 is a human male in their mid-twenties, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. Their most noticeable feature is a small spot on their mouth, which gives the appearance of a permanent smudge. They often appear nervous or fearful, and their mouth takes on a frightened expression. Subject 4163 possesses bright blue clown eyes, giving an unsettling appearance to their already anxious demeanor. 

Their forehead is adorned with a two-color band, which appears to be made of some form of metallic material. The subject also wears a gold earring and a silver chain as accessories. However, their most prominent accessory is a modified LED gas mask, which they wear at all times. The gas mask appears to have been upgraded with more technology than would usually be present in a standard gas mask. Despite this, its intended purpose is unknown.

Subject 4163 is a skilled programmer, possessing high levels of intelligence and creativity. However, they are known to display deep empathy towards others, often becoming emotional during times of suffering or pain. This has led to concerns about their ability to handle the stress of certain situations.

Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that subject 4163 has a fondness for animals and nature. Testing of this theory is pending approval from Level 4 personnel.

Additional Notes: Further investigation into Subject 4163's gas mask is recommended. There are concerns that it may possess additional features, which could pose a threat to containment.
