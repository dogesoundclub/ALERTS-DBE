Item #: SCP-9419

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9419 is to be contained within a soundproof observation chamber at all times. The door must remain locked, and no personnel are permitted to enter without approval from at least two Level 4 personnel. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-9419 must be screened for potential anomalous effects, and monitored for a minimum of 48 hours post-contact. Additionally, SCP-9419 is not to be broadcast on any media platform.

Description: SCP-9419 is a male human news anchor, identified as [REDACTED], who exhibits several anomalous properties. SCP-9419 is visually distinct due to the presence of spotted skin, a clown mouth, and red clown eyes. SCP-9419 also wears a doge hat, a red victory band on his forehead, a jade earring, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask.

SCP-9419 possesses a highly contagious memetic effect that spreads through visual and auditory means. When viewed or heard, subjects experience intense fits of exaggerated laughter and euphoria. The effects of exposure increase in intensity and duration with prolonged exposure, and are more potent in social situations where SCP-9419 is the center of attention.

SCP-9419's personality is characterized by an outgoing and sociable nature. SCP-9419 shows a deep desire for attention and often tells humorous stories and jokes that can trigger the aforementioned memetic effect. SCP-9419 is known to utilize his anomalous properties during news broadcasts, which often led to widespread outbreaks of contagious laughter and hysteria, even among SCP-9419's colleagues.

Addendum: Following Incident ████████, SCP-9419's broadcasting license was permanently revoked, and Foundation personnel implanted false memories of an on-air controversy to explain his disappearance. Acquisition of SCP-9419 has significantly reduced the number of anomalous events attributed to contagious laughter in the general population.
