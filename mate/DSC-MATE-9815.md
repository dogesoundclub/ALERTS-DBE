Description: DSC-MATE-9815 appears to be a male, anthropomorphic rabbit of average height and build.

DSC-MATE-9815 is known for its extraordinary caregiving skills, which extends not only to animals, but to various other objects as well. DSC-MATE-9815 has been observed giving names to various items in its possession, such as its car or household appliances, and appearing to talk to these items on occasion. It is noted that DSC-MATE-9815’s interaction with its surroundings may provide an unexplained boost in energy and well-being to the items in question.

Personnel have also observed instances of DSC-MATE-9815 comforting other DSCs that display more volatile behavior, such as DSC-████ and DSC-████, as if trying to soothe them. However, due to the potentially hazardous nature of these DSCs, personnel are advised not to put DSC-MATE-9815 in direct contact with them unless strictly necessary.

DSC-MATE-9815’s effects on items and creatures it interacts with may warrant further study into potential anomalous properties. However, its unobtrusive presence within Site-███ is deemed beneficial, and its employment as a veterinarian at the designated animal ward continues to be approved by on-site supervisors.
