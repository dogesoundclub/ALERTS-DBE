Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-408 is to be kept under strict observation while on duty as a train driver. It is imperative that SCP-408 only operates designated routes and adheres to railway regulations to prevent potential breach of secrecy.

Description: SCP-408 is a human male of average build and height with multiple spots on his face. He is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, green cross earring, gold chain, and a normal gas mask. SCP-408's most striking feature is his eyes, which are VR Jade LED.

SCP-408 exhibits a rebellious personality, often taking pleasure in pushing boundaries and testing limits. This behavior can lead to humorous situations, such as purposely breaking rules or finding ways to bend them just to see what happens. SCP-408 does not appear to be aware of the potential consequences of his actions and must be monitored closely.

SCP-408's anomalous properties manifest in his ability to alter reality within a designated radius. This ability seems to be activated under conditions of stress, anxiety, or extreme focus. The extent of SCP-408's reality-warping abilities is currently unknown, but it is believed to be a danger to civilian populations.

SCP-408 was apprehended after causing a minor train derailment resulting in one death and several injuries. SCP-408 remains in Foundation custody and has been recruited to operate on Foundation-operated railways.

Addendum: It is recommended that SCP-408 undergo extensive training in ethical decision-making and reality-warping control to minimize the risk of future incidents.
