Item #: DSC-MATE-809

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-809 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with materials that can withstand strong physical force. It is strictly forbidden for any personnel to enter the cell when DSC-MATE-809 is present unless authorized by Level 3 or higher personnel. 

Description: DSC-MATE-809 is a male tiger with the ability to speak human language fluently. It possesses a VR Jade LED eye system that allows it to see in the dark and enhances its vision. DSC-MATE-809 is often seen wearing a hoodie, a red scarf and sports a frightened look on its mouth. 

DSC-MATE-809 has the personality of a gruff, independent mechanic, often reluctant to ask for help, even when needed. He can be stubborn, especially when trying to accomplish a task alone. DSC-MATE-809 exhibits a strong sense of self-preservation and will react aggressively if he feels threatened.

DSC-MATE-809 possesses physical strength beyond that of a normal tiger, able to lift objects weighing over 400 kg with ease. Its ability to manipulate auto parts with precision has been noted by Foundation researchers, indicating that it has mechanic skills that surpass that of human technicians.

DSC-MATE-809 is often described as a loner, and has difficulty forming social bonds with both humans and other animals. Its aggressive personality and physical dominance have led to several reported incidents that resulted in serious injury to staff members.

Addendum: Incident Report 809-A: On 27/02/20██, DSC-MATE-809 was observed attempting to escape containment by breaking through the reinforced door to its cell. Security personnel reported the containment breach within 2 minutes, and a team of personnel was dispatched to confront DSC-MATE-809. During the confrontation, DSC-MATE-809 displayed aggressive behavior, and Foundation personnel were unable to subdue it. DSC-MATE-809 managed to injure 11 people before returning to its containment cell. After the incident, additional security measures have been implemented, and the containment cell has been reinforced to prevent future breaches.
