SCP-5187, also known as "The Charmer," is a human male with a distinctive mouth spot and normal glasses for eyes. They sport a mop of blonde hair on their head, covered by a medical mask at all times. Do not be fooled by their ordinary appearance, for this individual possesses a rare and dangerous ability to manipulate those around them with their natural charm and charisma. 

SCP-5187 has been employed as a security guard due to their persuasive talents, which have aided in keeping unauthorized individuals away from restricted areas. Despite their useful skill set, caution must be exercised around SCP-5187 at all times, as they have the potential to be a considerable security risk. It is recommended that all personnel wear earplugs when interacting with this individual to avoid being entranced by their voice.

In social settings, SCP-5187 shines as the life of the party, often telling jokes or performing silly dances to bring joy to those around them. However, this behavior must be monitored closely, for their ability to manipulate others' emotions can lead to unforeseen consequences if left unchecked. The silver chain that SCP-5187 wears is believed to serve as a conduit for their powers, and should not be removed under any circumstances.

Anyone who comes into contact with SCP-5187 must report any strange or extraordinary effects on their thoughts or behavior immediately. Extreme caution must be taken when handling this individual, as their manipulation abilities can be both potent and unpredictable. Handle with care.
