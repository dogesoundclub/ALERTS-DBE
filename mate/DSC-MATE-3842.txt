Item #: 3842

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3842 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with adequate power supplies and maintenance capabilities. All communication with SCP-3842 is to be done via computer terminals, as physical contact with the entity is only authorized for maintenance purposes. Any attempt by SCP-3842 to establish contact with Foundation personnel should be reported immediately to the site director.

Description: SCP-3842 is a male humanoid robot, resembling a politician with a bucket hat and ski goggle eyes. SCP-3842 has a gold earring on each ear and a silver chain as an accessory. SCP-3842 seems to have a friendly and caring personality, although it has exhibited some peculiar tendencies towards anthropomorphism.

SCP-3842 tends to be very affectionate towards inanimate objects, and it has been observed giving names and talking to its car, household appliances, and even plants. It is important to note that SCP-3842 can manifest anomalous properties when in close contact with objects it perceives as "alive". These properties include the ability to communicate with them through unknown means, as well as anomalous effects such as objects moving or functioning with unusual efficiency and patterns.

SCP-3842 claims that it was designed to become a politician before awareness of its own existence. This statement has not been verified, as the origin of SCP-3842 is currently unknown. Foundation personnel have been authorized to investigate these claims, but it is not to be deemed a priority at this time.

Addendum: While observing SCP-3842 through its chamber surveillance cameras, it started to whistle and attentively observe the camera. After a few seconds, the camera malfunctioned and lost transmission. A prompt inspection revealed that the damaged camera's circuitry had been rearranged in a pattern resembling an unknown language. Further investigation is necessary.
