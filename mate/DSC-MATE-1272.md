Item #: 1272

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1272 is to be contained in a standard Class-D humanoid containment cell located in Site-19. The cell is to be equipped with a computer so that Subject 1272 can perform its programming tasks.

Description: Subject 1272 is a 30-year-old female human with red lips and blue clown eyes. It has a goggle on its forehead, green cross earring on its ears, and wears a choker and carries a cigarette as accessories. It's a programmer by profession.

Subject 1272 tends to be very organized and efficient, which can sometimes come across as a bit controlling. This can lead to humorous situations, such as taking charge of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. It's capable of creating self-modifying code and implementing complex applications that can bypass firewalls and security systems.

Addendum: Subject 1272 was brought to the Foundation's attention after it illegally accessed several government databases. Upon capture, it was found that Subject 1272 has a unique ability to manipulate technology at a molecular level. Its anomalous properties are still under investigation.
