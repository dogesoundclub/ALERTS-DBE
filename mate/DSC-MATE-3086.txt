SCP-3086, also known as "The Tiger Engineer", is a highly energetic and enthusiastic individual who works as a train driver. Despite his imposing appearance as a male tiger, he is often described as friendly and approachable, with a natural charm that can easily win over even the most skeptical of individuals.

One of the most striking features of SCP-3086 are his red clown eyes, which seem to be permanently fixed in an expression of excitement and wonder. His ears are adorned with a gold earring, which he seems to take great pride in, often polishing it to a high shine.

In order to perform his job, SCP-3086 wears a normal gas mask, which he has modified to better suit his unique physiology. Though he claims that the mask is purely functional, some researchers have noted that it does give him a somewhat intimidating appearance.

SCP-3086's personality can sometimes get him into trouble, as he tends to get overly excited about things that others find mundane or uninteresting. However, this also makes him a valuable asset in situations where morale needs to be boosted or people need to be motivated.

Overall, SCP-3086 is a highly unique and fascinating individual, whose enthusiasm and energy are contagious. Though he may seem imposing at first glance, he is ultimately a friendly and approachable presence, and a trusted member of the SCP Foundation.
