Item #: 2541

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2541 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with specialized cages capable of accommodating the subject's unique physiology. The chamber should be filled with a replica of a natural environment preferred by the subject, including appropriate lighting and organic materials. Personnel must wear hazmat suits when interacting with the Subject to avoid any possibility of contamination. All interactions should take place under the supervision of a trained senior researcher.

Description:

Subject 2541 is a sentient rabbit, standing at 3 feet and exhibiting red clown eyes. Its head is covered by a bucket hat and adorned with a jade earring. In addition, it wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask around its neck. The subject displays a great deal of empathy and shows a deep understanding of others' emotions, often becoming overwhelmed to the point of tears when faced with others' pain and suffering. Subject 2541 is highly curious and fond of animals and nature.

Personnel are cautioned to maintain a safe distance from the subject and to bring no objects that could potentially harm the creature when interacting. Despite Subject 2541's benign nature, it is capable of quickly rabbiting away if threatened. It has not shown any aggressive behavior to date.

Addendum:

Subject 2541 was recovered from a local fast food restaurant where it was employed as a worker. During its capture, it showed no resistance and was subdued with ease. Further study is needed to determine the origins and capabilities of this anomalous entity.
