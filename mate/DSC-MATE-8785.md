Item #: 8785

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8785 must be kept under close surveillance at all times due to their highly unpredictable nature. They must be confined to a specially designed containment chamber, which has been fortified with reinforced steel and anti-magic wards. The room must be continuously monitored by trained personnel to ensure the safety of both the subject and any outside observers.

Description: Subject 8785, also known as Mr. Purple, is a human male of average height and build. His face is adorned with dark spots, and he is often seen wearing a medical mask that covers his mouth. When not obscured by the mask, he is known for his toothy grin that is often accompanied by quirky facial expressions. His eyes are obscured behind a pair of geeky glasses, which he rarely removes.

What sets Mr. Purple apart from ordinary individuals is the purple metallic hue that covers his entire skull. This unique feature adds to the mystery of his origins and has been the subject of much speculation among researchers. He also wears a silver chain around his neck, which seems to have some sort of magical properties.

Personality: Despite his unique appearance and extraordinary abilities, Mr. Purple is known for his dry sense of humor. He often delivers deadpan jokes that catch people off guard, and his wit has been compared to that of a stand-up comedian. He is a master of quick comebacks and is not afraid to speak his mind, even in the most uncomfortable situations.

His intelligence and cunning have made him a successful politician, and he has proven himself to be a skilled negotiator. However, his tendency to keep others at arm's length has led to a reputation as a loner, and he prefers to keep his private life separate from his public persona.

It is unknown whether Mr. Purple is a force for good or evil, and his true motives remain a mystery. He is a highly unpredictable individual and must be approached with caution, as his powers and abilities are still largely unknown. It is recommended that all interactions with Mr. Purple be conducted with express permission from higher authorities.
