Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4134 is to be kept in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. They are to be allowed free reign within the facility, as long as they do not disrupt any ongoing experiments or cause any security breaches. DSC-MATE-4134 is permitted to continue their designated job as a mechanic on-site, as long as they do not attempt to modify or cause damage to any Foundation technology or equipment. DSC-MATE-4134 is also required to attend regular sessions with a Foundation psychologist to monitor their empathy and compassion levels, as well as any potential mental manifestations.

Description: DSC-MATE-4134 is a human female roughly in their mid-twenties, with distinct spots across their face. They possess bright orange eyebrows and wear a medical mask, making identification of facial features difficult. Their overall appearance is reminiscent of a schoolgirl from the 2000s, complete with a choker accessory. Despite their unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-4134 displays no anomalous physical or cognitive abilities.

DSC-MATE-4134's unique characteristic is a highly empathetic and compassionate personality. They possess an overwhelming desire to help others and solve problems, often to the detriment of their own wellbeing. DSC-MATE-4134 is also prone to taking responsibility for others' misfortunes, leading to self-imposed guilt and anxiety. While this behavior is often regarded as admirable, DSC-MATE-4134's tendency to overexert themselves can lead to physical and mental exhaustion.

Addendum 4134-1: DSC-MATE-4134 was initially discovered in the aftermath of a Level 2 containment breach, where they assisted Foundation personnel in repairing damaged equipment and tending to injured personnel. Despite their lack of clearance, DSC-MATE-4134 was cooperative and efficient throughout the incident. After a thorough background check and psychological evaluation, DSC-MATE-4134 was deemed non-threatening and assigned to Site-██ as a mechanic. Further testing is ongoing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-4134's empathy and the potential effects on reality anchoring.
