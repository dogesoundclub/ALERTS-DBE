DogeSoundClub File #3644 - "The Electric Monk"

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3644 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to visual and auditory media are to be restricted unless approved by designated personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-3644 is a male human identified as an electrician. He possesses a monk-like hairstyle which is adorned with circular spots on his face. His eyes are covered by normal glasses and his mouth is usually covered by a medical mask, which he is always seen wearing. He also wears a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-3644 has exhibited a strong emotional sensitivity, often becoming tearful when exposed to sentimental and emotional moments in media entertainment. He also displays a great appreciation for music and art that elicits strong emotional responses.

Prolonged exposure to DSC-MATE-3644 will result in affected personnel also experiencing heightened emotional sensitivity and the tendency to empathize with others on a deeper level. This effect lasts for approximately 24 hours, after which the affected individual returns to their normal emotional state.

DSC-MATE-3644 was first brought to the organization's attention after reports of unusual behavior at a local movie theater. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and apprehend DSC-MATE-3644.

Addendum: It has been noted that DSC-MATE-3644's emotional sensitivity may prove useful in interrogations, as he is more likely to break under emotional duress. However, this tactic is only to be used under extreme circumstances and must be approved by Level 4 personnel.
