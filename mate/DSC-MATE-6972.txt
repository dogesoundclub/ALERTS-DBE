Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6972 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to SCP-6972's occupation, they are allowed limited access to the Site-██ spa, but only under strict escort with Foundation staff members. Any attempt to remove SCP-6972 from Foundation custody must be met with lethal force.

Description: SCP-6972 is a robotic humanoid that resembles a human beautician. They stand at 1.8 meters in height and are outfitted in fashionably frayed clothing; more specifically, a hoodie and silver chain. The robot's face is partially obscured by the medical mask they wear and their eyes are covered by normal glasses.

SCP-6972 is capable of predicting events before they occur, including any future actions that an individual may undertake. They also possess the ability to sense emotions, particularly heightened levels of anxiety or depression, which they will often attempt to alleviate.

SCP-6972 was originally discovered in [REDACTED], where they were working at a beauty salon, gifted to them by their creator. Upon hearing of SCP-6972's abilities, the Foundation intervened and retrieved the robot.

Addendum: Instances of SCP-6972-1 have been encountered on two separate occasions. SCP-6972-1 instances are non-anomalous drones that are programmed to assist SCP-6972. They are noted to be slightly smaller than SCP-6972 and do not possess the abilities imbued in SCP-6972. Any instances of SCP-6972-1 that are no longer in use are to be destroyed on-site.
