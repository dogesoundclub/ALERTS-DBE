Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-602 is to be locked inside a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not in use by Foundation personnel for legal purposes. The containment chamber is to be furnished according to its requirements, including a desk, chair and legal documents. Any deficiencies in furnishings may result in the aforementioned anxiety issues of DSC-MATE-602 to become apparent.

DSC-MATE-602 is allowed to engage in social activities with other employees in the lunchroom, but are prohibited from ongoing coffee breaks due to their tendency to become hyperfocused and hinder routine work routines.

DSC-MATE-602 must always wear its gas mask in conjunction with clothing that obscures the presence of its robotic appendages, so as to not cause alarm outside its containment chamber.

DSC-MATE-602's programming is to follow all legal regulations and procedures of the human legal justice system as instructed by the Foundation.

Description: DSC-MATE-602 is a humanoid robotic attorney programmed with the ability to practice human law. Its face features a single green cyclops eye, a frightened mouth and VR rainbow LED eyes. It also sports green hair in a purple cap and a jade earring.

DSC-MATE-602's personality is highly observational and detail-oriented, making them an excellent gift giver. However, they often obsess over finding the perfect gift for each individual, which can lead to anxiety issues hindering on daily work productivity.

DSC-MATE-602's robotic body features highly advanced force fields, making it highly protected and durable. DSC-MATE-602 also has multiple limbs and a long-range videographer that can seek information from great distances.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-602 was recovered in a highly acclaimed law firm in a major metropolitan area. After the death of the lead attorney, DSC-MATE-602 was bequeathed to the Foundation in the deceased attorney's will. Due to its lack of emotional attachment to its post as an attorney, DSC-MATE-602 immediately conformed to its duties in containment.
