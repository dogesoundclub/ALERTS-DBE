SCP Foundation File #3027: The Pink Rabbit
Classification: Euclid

Description: SCP-3027 is a humanoid entity of the human species, identified as a fashion designer by profession. Its most notable physical features include a virtual reality Jade LED eye prosthetic, a pink rabbit-shaped head, and Jade earrings functioning as its ears. SCP-3027 is commonly seen carrying a cigarette for personal recreational purposes.

Personality: SCP-3027 is a highly observant and detail-oriented individual, which makes it an asset for gift-giving. However, SCP-3027 has a tendency to become incredibly fixated on finding the "perfect" gift, sometimes becoming obsessive over the process. This compulsion to provide the best gift possible has led SCP-3027 to spend extended periods researching the recipient ahead of time.

Containment: SCP-3027 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-[REDACTED]. The chamber must be kept decorated with high-fashion and trendy clothing to keep SCP-3027 occupied. SCP-3027 is permitted to retain its Jade LED eye prosthetic and Jade earrings to maintain a stable mental state. Access to a personal computer for online gift browsing has been authorized but is monitored at all times.

SCP-3027 is recommended to be approached with caution, as its fixation on creating the perfect gift can cause it to become unstable and potentially dangerous if agitated. Personnel must be trained to avoid questioning SCP-3027's gift-giving tactics or any potential gifts, as it may lead to accelerated obsessive behavior.

Notes: SCP-3027 has provided multiple high-quality fashion designs to the Foundation upon request. It has also demonstrated an excellent understanding of fashion culture and trends, making it an invaluable asset to the Foundation's knowledge on this subject. SCP-3027's gift-giving skills remain unmatched within the Foundation, leading to several successful containment negotiations.
