Item #: SCP-6926

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6926 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. During interaction with SCP-6926, authorized personnel must wear standard medical masks to prevent possible infection.

Description: SCP-6926 is a female human with orange stripes on her face and orange eyebrows. She has typical 90s brown hair and wears a red cross earring on each earlobe. SCP-6926 also wears a medical mask, primarily to hide her contagious laughter.

SCP-6926 works as a fashion designer, creating unique pieces of clothing and accessories that express her creativity and personality. She is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck, which seems to have no anomalous properties.

SCP-6926's personality is that of a carefree and enthusiastic individual, valuing harmony and social connections. She is known to engage in playful banter and tell jokes, even in serious situations. SCP-6926's laughter is highly contagious and can spread to those within earshot, causing them to join in on the merriment.

SCP-6926's anomaly appears to be non-threatening; however, due to the ease at which SCP-6926's behavior can affect those around her, all interactions must be conducted under controlled conditions to ensure the safety of personnel.

Addendum: SCP-6926's fashion designs have been known to have an anomalous effect on individuals who wear them. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of this effect and its potential danger. ██/██/████ Update: SCP-6926 has been moved to Site-██'s Fashion Containment Wing for further study.
