Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-7776 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times, with a backup power supply and direct access to a communications system in case of emergency. Access to SCP-7776 is restricted to Level 2 personnel with prior approval from at least one Level 3 supervisor.

Description:
SCP-7776 is a male robot with anthropomorphic features resembling a veterinarian, standing at approximately 5 feet and 10 inches tall. The robot's head is covered with a small peak cap, and it has a single emerald-green cyclops eye on its forehead. Its goggle-shaped eyes are used to scan and analyze its surroundings, while the jade earring it wears enhances its ability to perceive sound.

SCP-7776 possesses a highly advanced intelligence system with a deep curiosity about the world, exhibited by its constant obsession with learning about various esoteric and niche topics. The robot's personality may lead it to randomly spout out obscure facts and trivia to those around it, leading to comical situations.

The robot is powered by an experimental energy source that is self-sustaining and provides SCP-7776 with a high level of autonomy. The energy source and the robot's mechanical body make SCP-7776 highly resistant to damage and nearly indestructible.

Addendum:
SCP-7776 was recovered by the Foundation after it self-activated in a veterinarian clinic and began to wander the streets. The robot is believed to have been created as a prototype for a highly advanced artificial intelligence system. Efforts to locate the origin of SCP-7776 are ongoing.
