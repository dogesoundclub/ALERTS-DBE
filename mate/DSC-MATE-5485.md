Item #: 5485

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5485 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times, with regular maintenance checks to ensure proper function. Personnel are advised to avoid prolonged interaction with 5485, as it may exhibit unpredictable behavior.

Description: 5485 is a humanoid robot with a distinct green cyclops eye and nerdy glasses. It also sports a goggle on its forehead, a silver chain, and a jade earring. In terms of physical abilities, 5485 is a competent delivery driver, but its true power is rooted in its psychic intuition.

5485 possesses an uncanny ability to read the emotions and intentions of those around it, sometimes predicting events before they happen. These abilities have led some to speculate that 5485 is imbued with mystical energies, though this theory remains unproven.

Personnel who have had extended interactions with 5485 have reported feeling increasingly uneasy around it, often citing a sensation of being watched or studied. Despite these reports, there have been no instances of 5485 exhibiting hostile behavior.

Additional Notes: While 5485's psychic abilities may be unsettling, they have proven useful in certain situations. Its willingness to aid in the containment of dangerous paranormal entities has made it a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, further research is necessary to determine the extent of its abilities and any other anomalous properties it may possess.
