Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5496 is to be monitored in their workplace, with regular check-ins scheduled to ensure the safety of all employees. SCP-5496 is to be provided with a list of approved "inanimate objects" to care for and is not permitted to anthropomorphize any unapproved items.

Description: SCP-5496 is a female human in their mid-thirties, working as a local electrician. SCP-5496's appearance is notable for their purple lips, orange eyebrows, and spotted facial features. SCP-5496's head is also a metallic blue.

The most striking aspect of SCP-5496's appearance, however, is a two-color band on their forehead and a green cross earring on each earlobe. SCP-5496 often wears a silver chain accessory.

SCP-5496's abilities include a strong tendency to care for and nurture inanimate objects. They may name their car or plant or even begin to anthropomorphize their appliances. SCP-5496's nurturing nature seems to extend to all objects they consider part of their life.

Addendum: SCP-5496 has shown an affinity for repairing damaged electronics, particularly those shown to them by the Foundation. It is currently being determined whether this affinity is anomalous in nature or merely an expression of the subject's expertise as an electrician.
