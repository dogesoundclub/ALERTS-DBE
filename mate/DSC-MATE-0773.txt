Item #: 773

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 773 is to be kept in a secure holding cell lined with reinforced steel, designed to withstand the strength of the creature's claws and teeth. The subject must have access to a constant supply of fresh meat and water to maintain their physical condition. All personnel entering the containment area must be equipped with heavy-duty tranquilizers in case of any hostile behavior.

Description: Item 773 is a male, Siberian tiger with vibrant, red clown eyes. The creature sports a blue bandana on its head and a jade earring on one of its ears. The subject is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck, and carrying a whistle in its mouth. Item 773's intelligence and ability to communicate through whistles has led researchers to believe that there may be more to this creature than originally believed.

Personality: Though the subject's strong sense of independence and stubbornness can be seen as humorous in some situations, these traits can also lead to dangerous confrontations. Item 773 is resistant to authority and may show aggression towards anyone who tries to control or dominate it. Despite this, the creature is highly intelligent and capable of complex problem-solving when motivated.

Addendum: Item 773 was captured wandering through the city, disguised as a human banker. It is unknown how the creature was able to acquire the necessary attire and knowledge to impersonate a member of society. Further investigation into this unusual behavior is ongoing.
