Item #: SCP-8086

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8086 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with video monitoring and audio recording equipment in place. All personnel assigned to SCP-8086 are to be trained in handling potentially hazardous situations, as SCP-8086 has demonstrated a tendency to take risks and engage in dangerous behavior.

Description: SCP-8086 is a female human, identified as a banker based on documentation found during initial containment. SCP-8086 possesses unique physical characteristics, including orange stripes on their face and orange eyebrows. SCP-8086 sports a broad smile, adding to their overall friendly appearance. They have long, brunette hair from the 90s and gold earrings that frame their face.

SCP-8086's personality is one of curiosity and a love for adventure, leading them to take risks and try new things. While this occasionally leads to amusing stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping, it also puts SCP-8086 in danger, making them a concern for containment. They also often get lost while exploring the wilderness, making it necessary to keep them under constant surveillance.

SCP-8086 is a sociable individual and enjoys interacting with others, often testing their boundaries or attempting to convince them to join them in their adventures. Their persuasive nature can make it difficult to keep them contained, as they often try to negotiate for more freedom or access to areas outside of containment.

Addendum: SCP-8086's ability to charm and persuade others makes them a valuable asset for the Foundation, especially in operations that require interaction with civilians. However, the danger they pose to themselves and others cannot be overlooked, and they must remain contained for their safety and the safety of others.
