Description: SCP-5477 is a humanoid robotic entity designed to resemble a 1920s theater manager. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall, with a prominent feature being its singular green cyclops eye. Additionally, its head is adorned with a retro style cap and a jade earring in the left ear.

SCP-5477 has a very spontaneous personality and enjoys taking risks on a whim, often leading to humorous and even dangerous situations. It has been noted to make impulsive decisions, such as jumping off of cliffs into bodies of water without considering the potential consequences.

SCP-5477's job as a theater manager has been beneficial in keeping it contained. It has shown no signs of aggression towards any personnel, and instead appears to thrive on entertaining audiences with its antics and performances.
