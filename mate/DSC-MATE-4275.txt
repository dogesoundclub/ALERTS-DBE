Item #: 4275

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4275 must be contained in a humanoid containment chamber at all times when not participating in authorized activities under Foundation supervision. Subject 4275 must be provided with adequate resources and accomodations, such as food, water, and entertainment materials, as part of their strict daily schedule. Bi-weekly checkups by onsite personnel are mandatory to ensure the physical and mental wellbeing of subject 4275.

Description: Subject 4275 is a male monkey of an unknown subspecies, with distinctive purple headwear resembling a political campaign hat and matching headset at all times. It is still unclear how subject 4275 came into possession of their fashion accessories. They also possess a golden earring on their right ear and a silver chain around their neck. As a result of their political attire, subject 4275 is often perceived as a parody of politicians or political satire.

Subject 4275 bears a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which has caused it to overload itself with tasks, ultimately causing humorous situations. Despite their apparent lack of seriousness displayed by their costume, subject 4275 is shown to be somewhat intelligent and possesses a unique set of skills that are yet to be disclosed or studied by the Foundation.

Addendum: Following the accidental loss of their formal headwear during routine maintenance, subject 4275 has displayed mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, including refusal to participate in tasks and loss of appetite, which were effectively alleviated through the provision of alternative headwear. This behavior has led to the reinforced need for "job-specific" attire in restoring and maintaining subject 4275's mood and satisfaction as part of their containment procedure.
