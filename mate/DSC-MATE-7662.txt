Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7662 must maintain a normal lifestyle and is not to be approached by any staff members during live broadcasting.

Description: SCP-7662 is a male tiger with a unique physical appearance. SCP-7662 has ski goggle-like eyes and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-7662 is always wearing a silver chain around his neck, which he has refused to take off since containment. SCP-7662 is locally known as the "golden voice" of the news channel and has become a household name in the city.

SCP-7662's personality is characterized by being highly observant and attentive to details. SCP-7662 is an excellent gift-giver but can become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift. SCP-7662's attention to detail can lead to extensive agonizing over finding the ideal gift, which has been observed to frustrate SCP-7662.

SCP-7662's anomaly is unknown, but it is assumed to be related to its unique physical appearance. It has been observed that SCP-7662's eyes can generate a powerful mesmerizing effect when in direct eye-contact with live spectators or viewers. Reports on possible connection between SCP-7662 and other anomalous beings in the city are currently under investigation.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-7662 reported having a dream about being part of a large feline community outside the city limits. SCP-7662 claimed he had a feeling of not belonging in the city and longed for being part of his own kind. Research teams are communicating with SCP-7662 to monitor this behavior closely.
