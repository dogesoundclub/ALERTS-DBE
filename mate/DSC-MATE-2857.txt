SCP-2857 is a humanoid entity that is easily identified by its striking appearance. The subject is a female with vibrant red clown eyes, which serve as an alarming indicator of her presence. SCP-2857 is often seen sporting a tiara on her head and a red cross earring on each ear, signifying a connection to the medical profession. 

One of the most distinct features of SCP-2857 is the LED gas mask often worn as an accessory. This mask appears to be a modified firefighterâ€™s mask, and is used as a protective barrier against hazardous chemical compounds. When activated, it emits a pulsating light that surrounds the area around the mask. This light has been observed to be extremely effective in calming people down and creating a therapeutic environment.

SCP-2857's personality is unique in that it is extremely empathetic and sensitive to the emotions of others. She has a natural ability to attune herself to the feelings of others in a way that is almost supernatural. This is reflected in her behavior as well, as she has a tendency to use humor to get others to see the positive side in difficult situations. 

It is important to note that SCP-2857's abilities are not without limits. Her empathic abilities have the potential to be overwhelming and can be easily disrupted if she becomes too emotionally invested in a given situation. As with all SCPs, it is necessary to handle SCP-2857 with caution and care. However, it is undeniable that the subject's unique abilities have the potential to be extremely useful, especially in situations that require calming and positive influences.
