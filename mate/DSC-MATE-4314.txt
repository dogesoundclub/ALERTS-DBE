Item #: SCP-4314

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4314 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Interaction with SCP-4314 is to be kept to a minimum, as excessive conversation can lead to the manifestation of anomalous effects. Staff members are advised to approach SCP-4314 with caution and to only engage in conversations that are strictly necessary for containment procedures.

Description: SCP-4314 is a humanoid entity identified as a human female of average height and weight. SCP-4314 is distinguishable by the spots on her face, purple lips, and red clown eyes. She has green hair, which she often wears in a purple cap, and a silver chain around her neck. SCP-4314 can regularly be seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-4314 is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas. Her abilities can lead to some humorous situations, such as suggesting outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react. However, these abilities also manifest in the form of anomalous properties.

When engaged in lengthy conversations, SCP-4314 has been known to manipulate the conversations into reality-warping scenarios. This effect is often limited to SCP-4314's immediate vicinity, but can potentially affect the surrounding area if the conversation continues for an extended period of time. Any staff member who suspects SCP-4314 is manipulating reality is advised to terminate the conversation and vacate the vicinity immediately.

Addendum: SCP-4314 is currently employed as a theater manager at [REDACTED]. Despite her anomalous properties, SCP-4314 has proven capable of managing the theater without any significant incidents. However, all communications with SCP-4314 regarding the theater's operations are to be strictly monitored for any reality-warping conversations.
