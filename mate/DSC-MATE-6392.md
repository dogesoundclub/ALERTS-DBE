Item #: 6392

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. [REDACTED], also known as 6392, is to be kept in a specialized cage located in a low-traffic section of Sector [REDACTED]. The cage must be constructed with reinforced steel, due to 6392’s tendency to chew through weaker materials. 6392 is to be provided with hay and fresh vegetables at least twice a day, and allowed out of its cage for exercise once a week under careful supervision. Testing on 6392 is to be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel and an on-site physician.

Description: 6392 is a male rabbit, weighing approximately 6 pounds. The most notable feature of 6392 is its constant expression of fear, with its mouth agape and trembling when approached or spoken to. 6392 wears a bucket hat at all times, which has exhibited a calming effect on the rabbit’s behavior.

6392’s forehead is adorned with a two-color band, which often incites curiosity from on-site staff. However, attempts to remove the band have resulted in violent outbursts from the rabbit, indicating a potential defensive mechanism.

Personality: Despite its outward expression of fear, 6392 exhibits a highly analytical and logical personality. It is known to debate or argue with staff members for entertainment, even on trivial matters. This has resulted in several amusing exchanges between 6392 and staff. Despite its intelligence, 6392 is prone to anxious behavior and may exhibit hostility when feeling threatened.

Addendum 6392-A: On [REDACTED], 6392 displayed unusual aggression, breaking out of its cage and attacking the on-site physician in charge of its care. Further testing is pending to determine the cause of this behavior, and whether additional containment procedures are required.
