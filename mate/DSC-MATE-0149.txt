Item #: SCP-149

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-149 is to be held in an isolated theater building in the city. The interior of the theater is to be modified to resemble a standard apartment building fa√ßade. All theater employees, audiences, and locals must be screened for any signs of anomaly. Any suspicious activity is to be reported immediately to the local manager.

Description: SCP-149 is a humanoid in appearance and has claimed to be a human. It is a male, approximately 35 years of age, and stands at 1.8 meters in height. Its most notable features include a spotted face, nerd glasses, and a two-color band on its forehead. Additionally, it sports a single gold earring on its right ear, a red scarf around its neck, and an LED gas mask.

SCP-149 exhibits a highly analytical and logical personality but also possesses a peculiar sense of humor. It enjoys making witty observations and often teases its friends in a dry and deadpan manner. SCP-149 is highly responsive to commands and shows a willingness to cooperate with operatives.

Although SCP-149 does not exhibit any overt physical or cognitive abnormalities, its tendency towards isolationism and esoteric interests in theater has led it to be declared an SCP. It is believed that SCP-149 may have secret knowledge regarding the foundation of these interests that could potentially be exploited for use in other SCP operations. The foundation will continue to monitor and study SCP-149's behavior especially with regard to its peculiar sense of humor.
