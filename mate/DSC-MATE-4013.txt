SCP-4013, codenamed "The Traffic Warden of Destruction," is a remarkable specimen of a tiger that has been granted the gift of sapience by unknown means. With the keen analytical mind of a predator and the heart of a warrior, the creature has elected to leave the forests to become a keeper of law and order in urban environments.

SCP-4013's eyes are a curious affair; they closely resemble ski goggles and can be slid shut on demand. The tiger is always adorned in a silver chain, hanging around its neck, and often dispatched with a candy stick in its mouth. It is important to note that the candy stick has no obvious owner and appears to materialize from thin air.

Despite its fearsome appearance, SCP-4013 is a level-headed and noble urban protector, adhering to strictly defined traffic regulations while on patrol. It is believed that the creature's diligent and focused nature stems from a natural predator's instinct of vigilance, ready to pounce on wrongdoers at any given moment.

However, there is more to SCP-4013 than just its penchant for traffic law enforcement. The creature has a creative and artistic side that it may express through various hobbies or interests. It is not uncommon to find the tiger indulging in painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of artistic expression. It's suggested, but not confirmed, that this is related to the creature's gifted intelligence, which must be fostered in proper challenges and activities, lest it turns to boredom and destructive behavior.

SCP-4013 is a valuable asset to The Foundation, and is held in a designated containment facility in the heart of [REDACTED]. Its work, both artistic and as a traffic officer, are well appreciated, and it has been known to form meaningful bonds with some of its co-workers. However, caution should be exercised around SCP-4013, as it is ultimately a wild animal with unpredictable moods and behavior.
