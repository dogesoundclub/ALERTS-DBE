SCP-9228, also known as "The Quick-Witted Car Salesman", is a humanoid creature resembling a human female, standing at approximately 5'8" tall. Their most notable feature is their VR jade LED eyes, gleaming with an otherworldly luminance that draws in unsuspecting prey. SCP-9228's head is adorned with a wild mop of green hair, often concealed by a purple cap adorned with mysterious symbols. The creature's ears are adorned with jade earrings, which emit a faint humming noise when excited.

SCP-9228 is a skilled car salesman, using their quick wit and charm to win over any unsuspecting clients. Their ability to debate and argue has aided in the sales process, often convincing customers into making decisions they may not have considered otherwise. However, SCP-9228's talents are not limited to only selling automobiles, as they often engage in playful arguments with friends and family for mere enjoyment.

It is advised that personnel engaging with SCP-9228 exercise caution, as the creature has been known to use their quick wit and persuasive abilities to manipulate situations to their benefit. Despite this, SCP-9228 has shown no signs of malicious intent, and has cooperated with Foundation personnel during initial containment procedures.
