SCP-2196, designated as "The Farmer," is a human female with distinctive and unnatural features. Her face is adorned with bold orange stripes, coupled with a perpetual, toothy smile that never seems to waver. What stands out the most about her are her red clown eyes, which seem to glow with a peculiar otherworldly energy.

Her head peers out from beneath a retro cap, sporting a pair of goggles on her forehead that seem to serve no apparent purpose. Other noticeable features include green cross earrings that hang from her ears, a silver chain that dangles menacingly around her neck, and an LED gas mask that obscures her face.

Despite her peculiar appearance, SCP-2196 is generally harmless to those around her. She is often found deep in thought, lost in her own mind, and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Her introspective nature can sometimes lead to amusing situations where she accidentally walks into walls or trips over her own feet.

The origins of SCP-2196 are uncertain, but she has reportedly been a farmer for most of her life. It is unclear if her unique features are a result of experimentation or mutation, but caution should still be exercised around her. SCP-2196's psychological profile is still being studied, but her behavior appears to be erratic at times.

Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-2196's powers, she is to be kept under constant observation and locked away in a secure facility. Any personnel that come into contact with her must be screened for psychological effects and monitored for symptoms of any adverse side effects.
