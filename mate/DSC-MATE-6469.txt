Item #: SCP-6469

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6469 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be furnished with a bed, a small desk, and some basic amenities for a police officer. SCP-6469's diet should consist of fresh vegetables, fruits, and small amounts of candy. 

Description: SCP-6469 appears to be a humanoid rabbit whose face exhibits constant fear, with its mouth open in a jaw-dropping expression. It wears a red beanie on its head and ski goggles on its eyes. The ears have a gold earring pierced through the right earlobe. SCP-6469 frequently carries a candy stick in its hand.

SCP-6469, when questioned about its origins, claims to have been previously employed as a police officer for a small town in the American Midwest. There are no records of SCP-6469's existence in any public database, and no one has come forward to identify or claim the entity's ownership.

SCP-6469 displays a relaxed and laid-back personality, even in stressful situations. It has a fondness for sweets, particularly candy sticks, which it consumes frequently. SCP-6469 can be fiercely protective of its loved ones, and it has been known to engage in heated debates with individuals who insult them.

Addendum: Based on SCP-6469's unique appearance and behavior, it is suspected that it may have undergone some form of anomalous transformation. Further testing and observation are needed to determine the extent of SCP-6469's abilities and any potential threats it may pose to human society.
