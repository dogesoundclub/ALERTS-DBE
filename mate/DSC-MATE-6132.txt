Item #: 6132

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the unpredictable nature of 6132, she is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All social interactions with her must be monitored by at least two trained staff members at all times. Access to personal electronic devices is prohibited within the containment chamber. Any instances of behavior related to 6132's anomalous properties must be reported immediately to the on-site supervisor.

Description: 6132 is a human female with striking orange striped facial features and purple lips. Her eyes are red clown eyes, and she is often seen wearing a bucket hat with goggles resting on her forehead. She also wears a choker and an LED gas mask. This appearance has been observed to cause a strong reaction in individuals who come into contact with 6132, often leading to feelings of unease or excitement.

6132 has a highly outgoing and social personality which often manifests in the desire to be the center of attention. Her humor is often infectious and known to draw attention from crowds. This is believed to be the result of her anomalous effect on individuals who have direct contact with her. It has been noted that individuals who spend an extended period around 6132 have reported feeling a heightened sense of pleasure and excitement.

While her effects on individuals are largely benign, there have been instances where her presence has caused individuals to behave erratically or make poor decisions. Due to her unpredictable nature, a constant monitoring is necessary. 

Addendum:

On ██/██/20██, 6132 was discovered during a routine audit of a local law firm's hiring practices. It was noticed that those who interviewed with 6132 were more likely to accept the job offer despite the company's poor reviews. The Foundation was notified and the law firm was investigated for potential use of anomalous properties in their hiring process. Investigation yielded no evidence of additional anomalies. It was recommended that 6132 be recruited and contained by the Foundation.

Note: Due to her unusual abilities, it is believed that 6132 may have potential use in certain intelligence and investigative processes. Research and experimentation must be conducted under strict supervision and with awareness of potential consequences.
