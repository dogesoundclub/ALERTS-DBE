Special Containment Procedures: The subject was terminated on [REDACTED] after being exposed to SCP-████. Her remains are to be incinerated and disposed of in accordance with Foundation protocol.

Description: Subject 2146 was a human female, approximately 30 years old, and worked as a news anchor for a local television station. She possessed distinctive heterochromatic eyes, with one being orange and the other being green, as well as an unusual head of hair which resembled a rainbow-colored mane seen at a festival.

Other notable features included a silver chain around her neck and a green cross earring worn in her left ear. She was frequently seen smoking cigarettes while reporting on the news.

Subject 2146 was highly analytical and logical, possessing a sharp wit and a penchant for debating and arguing with others. This trait often got her into humorous situations, as she would engage in heated debates over trivial matters that others found trivial or unimportant.

Following her exposure to SCP-████, Subject 2146 displayed a significant increase in aggression and hostility, as well as a marked decrease in cognitive function. She exhibited symptoms of acute disorientation, paranoid delusions, and loss of motor control.

Interviews and observations conducted during her containment revealed that Subject 2146 was harboring a deep-seated resentment towards the Foundation and those responsible for her transformation. Her state of mind deteriorated rapidly, and she ultimately had to be terminated for the safety of staff and for security reasons.

Addendum: Investigation into the source of Subject 2146's transformation is ongoing. All personnel are advised to exercise caution when handling SCP-████ and to report any unusual symptoms or behaviors immediately.
