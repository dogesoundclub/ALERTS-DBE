SCP-7811, codenamed "The Rabbit Reporter," is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Most remarkable, however, is her head which has taken on the appearance of a pink rabbit. The transformation appears complete, with her ears taking on a distinctly furry quality and green cross earrings dangling from them. Her eyebrows have turned orange, along with her eyes, making for an unsettling but fascinating visage. 

A journalist by profession, SCP-7811 displays a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge in any given situation. Her dominating personality comes to the fore, whether it's in a work environment, social gatherings or her personal life. Persons in her vicinity report an overwhelming desire to follow her directives, and her particular aura creates a sense of calm and authority. Despite her unusual appearance, she is an effective communicator and uses this to great effect. 

The choker adorning her neck appears to be a significant part of her identity and thus of particular interest to researchers studying her. It is hypothesized that the accessory may be imbued with magical energy, augmenting her natural charisma. Her overall demeanor makes her one of the more popular members of our foundation, eliciting much interest on the part of both experienced and newer staff members. The Rabbit Reporter could prove a powerful asset when handling anomalous objects and persons in the field.
