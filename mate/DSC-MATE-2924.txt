Item #: 2924

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2924 is to be contained in a secure, air-tight container at all times, located in a secure facility only accessible to Level 4 personnel. Under no circumstances are unauthorized personnel allowed to access item 2924 without prior written permission from at least two Level 4 personnel. The container containing item 2924 is to be outfitted with electronic safeguards to prevent any unauthorized entry.

Description: Item 2924 is a male robot, roughly 5 feet in height. Its body is composed of advanced, steel alloys designed for durability and strength. Item 2924 is equipped with complex artificial intelligence programming, allowing it to adapt and learn on the fly. Its eyes are composed of high-end VR Jade LED, providing it with exceptional visual abilities. Its head is adorned with a distinctive red beanie that conceals its circuitry, augmented by a red cross earring hung from its left ear. The robot's forehead features a goggle on the forehead.
 
Item 2924 is programmed for a specific specialization of being a programmer, and is known to exhibit an ambitious and goal-oriented personality, which often drives it to take on more work than it can realistically handle. However, due to its formidable strategic thinking skills and exceptional organizational skills, it typically manages to complete all its projects on schedule, bringing success to its assigned tasks.

Attached to its faceplate, item 2924 is likely to be seen wearing an LED gas mask that glows in the dark. This mask enhances the robot's performance by regulating its airflow and filtering out harmful substances to keep its sensitive circuitry fully functioning, oblivious to any external damage.

Addendum: 2924 is considered to be a unique anomaly that displays a combination of machine and organic behavior patterns. The development and motives for this strange anomaly are still unknown, prompting further investigation.
