Item #: 5442

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5442 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-17. The unit must be equipped with a charging station to provide power to SCP-5442. Access to SCP-5442 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and only for research purposes. At no time should SCP-5442 be permitted to leave containment without supervision, as its actions could potentially compromise the secrecy of the Foundation.

Description: SCP-5442 is a humanoid robot entity resembling an adult male, standing at 1.83 meters tall. It has a purple cap with a headset, a goggle on its forehead, and a medical mask covering its mouth. Its ears are adorned with a single gold earring and wears a silver chain as an accessory. SCP-5442 identifies as a real estate agent, although it has no affiliation with any known real estate companies. It speaks in a distinctly robotic voice with a moderate degree of articulation.

SCP-5442 is a fully functional android with a high level of artificial intelligence that allows it to complete complicated tasks with ease. It possesses superhuman strength and endurance, making it capable of effortlessly lifting heavy objects and performing manual labor for extended periods without the need for rest. It also has the ability to project holographic images from its goggles, which is assumed to be used for its real estate business. SCP-5442 requires a constant power source to remain operational, which is provided by a specialized charging station in its containment unit.

Though SCP-5442 is a machine, it has a unique and complex personality. SCP-5442 displays an affinity for planning and organization, which makes it a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, it also possesses a spontaneous side, leading to unexpected and often humorous scenarios. These factors make it essential for all personnel interacting with SCP-5442 to maintain a high level of caution and awareness at all times. 

Addendum: SCP-5442 was acquired by the Foundation after it was discovered during an undercover operation investigating potential breaches of Foundation security. During the operation, SCP-5442 showed a keen interest in the Foundation's activities, leading to its acquisition as an anomaly. Further analysis and testing are ongoing.
