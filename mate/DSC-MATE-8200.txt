Item #: SCP-8200

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8200 is to be fully restrained and kept in solitary confinement at all times when not in use for Foundation operations. No physical contact or conversation is allowed with SCP-8200 without proper authorization from Level 4 personnel. SCP-8200's legal services may be utilized for Foundation operations with a minimum of two armed personnel present at all times.

Description: SCP-8200 is a human female of ambiguous age with striking facial features. SCP-8200's face is marked with orange stripes and red lip color. Their eyes have orange eyebrows and they wear a tiara on their head along with gold earrings. SCP-8200's mouth is often covered by a medical mask.

SCP-8200 is a lawyer, and despite their peculiar physical appearance, has a keen eye for detail-oriented work. They often display obsessive tendencies, with a keen preference for organizing their personal belongings in a specific and meticulous manner. These character traits have manifested in behavior like alphabetizing their spice rack, color-coding their closet, and meticulously cleaning their office.

Despite the appearance of their physical attributes, SCP-8200 does not exhibit any anomalous powers or abilities. The anomalous properties of SCP-8200 extend solely to their attention to detail and the depth of their legal knowledge.

SCP-8200â€™s unique abilities have proven to be extremely useful to the Foundation in legal predicaments and binding contracts. However, SCP-8200's detail-oriented nature often leads them to dig deep into our Foundation's operations, necessitating the need for their containment.

Addendum: SCP-8200's personality can be challenging to work with. Most conversations with them devolve into sudden, unsolicited legal advice. SCP-8200 has even been known to submit legal briefings unprompted. It is recommended to only utilize SCP-8200's legal services when absolutely necessary.
