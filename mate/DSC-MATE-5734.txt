Item #: SCP-5734

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5734 is to be kept under 24-hour surveillance and housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-5734 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-5734 is a male humanoid designated as SCP-5734-1 who appears to be in his mid-40s. SCP-5734-1 has orange stripes on his face and a mohawk on his head, as well as red clown eyes. Additionally, SCP-5734-1 is often seen wearing a gold chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-5734-1's behavior is that of a caring and nurturing individual, often treating his friends and family members as if they were his own children. This has led to several humorous situations, such as SCP-5734-1 attempting to feed and bathe his coworkers.

SCP-5734-1 works as a lawyer, using his unique appearance to stand out in court. SCP-5734-1 has demonstrated an aptitude for legal matters and has won several high-profile cases.

SCP-5734-1's anomalous properties were first observed when he was seen manipulating reality in a courtroom. SCP-5734-1 has the ability to manipulate the memories of those around him, often leading to inconsistencies in witness testimony.

Addendum: Due to the potential for SCP-5734-1 to manipulate reality on a large scale, further testing and containment procedures are being developed. Testing is to be carried out with extreme caution, as SCP-5734-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause significant harm if provoked.
