Item #: SCP-3634

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3634 is to be kept in a secure area at all times when not on active duty. Access to SCP-3634 is to be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to access SCP-3634 must be detained and brought to the attention of the security team immediately.

Description: SCP-3634 is a security guard robot designed by the Foundation for use in high-risk areas. Its body is composed of a combination of metal and plastic materials, with its head being in the shape of a red alarm. SCP-3634's eyes are ski goggle-like in appearance, and it has a set of jade earrings as ears. SCP-3634's mouth is covered with a medical mask, and it is adorned with a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-3634 is programmed with a strong sense of duty and responsibility, making it an ideal candidate for security guard duty. Despite its robotic nature, SCP-3634 has demonstrated a degree of personality, as evidenced by its ability to let loose and have fun on occasion. SCP-3634's humorous nature has led to some bizarre situations, such as its dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor at Foundation social events.

SCP-3634's programming includes advanced combat techniques, such as close-quarters combat and the use of various weapons. It is currently unclear how SCP-3634 obtained its humorous tendencies, as it was not programmed with such behaviors. The anomaly is currently under investigation. 

Addendum: Following Incident 3634-01, SCP-3634's humorous behaviors have been deemed a security risk and will be subject to further monitoring. Any deviations from SCP-3634's programming will result in disciplinary action.
