SCP-4660 is a peculiar humanoid entity, classified under the species of Homo sapiens. Its appearance is characterized by vibrant and contrasting colors, with a face feature of orange stripes and purple lips. SCP-4660’s most unusual attribute is its eyes – beholding a pair of blood-curdling red eyes akin to that of a clown. 

SCP-4660 prefers to have an orange side head style and glistening gold earrings, with a silver chain hanging from its neck. It is often seen smoking cigarettes, as it is a part of its daily routine. 

SCP-4660 has a dominant personality, exhibiting leadership qualities, and taking charge of any situation it is in. It is a perfectionist when it comes to its work as a fashion designer and strives for efficiency and effectiveness. However, some personnel may perceive SCP-4660’s demeanor as bossy or intimidating, but it is only a facade of its firm exterior. 

Under surveillance, SCP-4660 tends to become increasingly restless and nervous. It is hypothesized that this may be due to its desire to be productive and fear of unproductivity. As a precautionary measure, SCP-4660’s smoking habits are monitored as it has been known to increase its anxiety levels. 

SCP-4660’s behavior triggers several uncertainties, and it is advised to maintain a safe distance during interaction.
