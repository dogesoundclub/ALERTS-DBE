Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5999 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. It is to be provided with a writing desk, various writing utensils, and reading material to stimulate its creative mind. Access to any objects for collecting or cosplay is strictly prohibited.

SCP-5999 is to have daily psychological evaluations by trained personnel to ensure its mental stability. Any indication of abnormal behavior or increase in unpredictable tendencies is to be immediately reported to senior personnel.

Description: SCP-5999 is a male Bengal tiger, approximately 2 meters in height and weighing approximately 300 kg. Its face features a constant state of fear, accompanied by a pair of horned rim glasses. SCP-5999 often wears a blue bandana wrapped around its head and a goggle on its forehead. It has a red cross earring on its left ear and is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck.

SCP-5999's most notable feature is its use of a cigarette as an accessory, despite the apparent lack of need for it.

SCP-5999 has exhibited a creative and imaginative personality, often engaging in various hobbies and interests such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. It has displayed a particular interest in fashion and fashion design.

SCP-5999's ability to de-escalate tense situations and soothe those around it has been noted during interactions with personnel. However, its fear-ridden expression and the unpredictability of its behavior make it a potential danger to those around it.

Addendum: SCP-5999 was discovered working as a banker in New York City, displaying no anomalous behavior until an incident in which it turned a customer's complaint into an award-winning short story. Witnesses reported uncontrollable weeping and laughter among those who read the story, leading to its containment by the Foundation. SCP-5999 has not expressed any desire to leave Foundation custody and appears to be content in its current situation.
