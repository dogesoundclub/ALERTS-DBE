Item #: 3128

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 3128 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to Item 3128 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher, and any interaction with Item 3128 must be done with caution.

Description: Item 3128 is a male human, approximately 6 feet tall, with distinctive features on his face, including orange stripes and a frightened mouth. Item 3128 has a mohawk hairstyle and wears nerd glasses, a gold earring, and a gold chain as accessories. Item 3128 also wears an LED gas mask, which appears to be connected to a unique air filtration system that allows the wearer to breathe normally in situations with harmful or noxious gases.

Item 3128's most notable trait is his observant and attentive nature, leading him to be an excellent gift-giver. However, this can also lead to obsessive and intrusive thoughts, causing Item 3128 to spend a considerable amount of time agonizing over what gift to give someone, searching for the absolute perfect gift, and becoming anxious and fearful of not finding it.

Addendum: Item 3128 was found wandering in downtown ██████, USA, claiming to have escaped from a government facility. After being apprehended, Item 3128 was brought to Site-██, where it was determined that he had obtained anomalous abilities. Further testing and observation are necessary, and any attempts to use Item 3128's gift-giving abilities to manipulate or influence others are strictly prohibited.
