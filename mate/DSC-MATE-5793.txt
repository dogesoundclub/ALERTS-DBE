SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

SCP-5793, codenamed "The News Anchor," is a male human of average height and build with a charming smile plastered on his face at all times. However, what makes him truly anomalous are his eyes. Instead of the normal human pupils and irises, SCP-5793 has cybernetic LED lenses installed in his eye sockets with a rainbow color scheme that emits a constant glow.

SCP-5793 is almost always seen wearing a red beanie, even when he is on air, and refuses to remove it despite requests from his superiors. While being interviewed, he claimed that the beanie has special properties that protects his connection to an unknown, higher power.

SCP-5793 is known for his strong and decisive personality, leading some to describe him as bossy and intimidating. However, his intentions are solely to ensure efficiency and effectiveness when it comes to his work. SCP-5793 is always one step ahead of the game, breaking news stories in record time and earning a reputation as one of the best news anchors in the business.

Despite his success, however, SCP-5793 remains an enigma. It is unknown whether his cybernetic eyes are related to his anomalous abilities, or if there is something more sinister lurking beneath his charismatic exterior. SCP Foundation researchers are constantly monitoring SCP-5793 for any signs of danger or suspicious activity.
