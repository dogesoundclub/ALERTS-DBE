Subject 7903 is a humanoid entity that goes by the name of "Charm." As an electrician, they have shown proficiency in working with electrical systems and advanced machinery. The most distinct feature of this entity is the spots on their face and a perpetually present smile. Their eyes are a unique shade of orange with eyebrow markings that seem to add a surrealistic touch to their appearance. It is said that those who look into their eyes for too long may become entranced and charmed by the entity's likable presence.

Subject 7903's typical attire is a dark hoodie that covers their head, giving them a mysterious persona. They also wear a choker necklace as an accent accessory that exudes a subtle punk aesthetic.

Personality-wise, Subject 7903 possesses exceptional social skills, making it easy to connect with people around them. Their contagious humor allows them to have amusing conversations with strangers, and they can quickly open others up and make them feel more comfortable in their presence. It is equally impressive and unnerving to have a conversation with this entity since they can analyze one's personality and vulnerabilities with just a glance. Often, subjects who engage in long conversations with them report a stronger connection and a newfound empathy for others. 

Agents are advised to keep their interactions with Subject 7903 professional and limited unless necessary. While this entity seems benign, it is unknown if there are deeper motives or hidden agendas that align with its abilities. As always, we must remain vigilant in our observation and documentation of all sentient beings to ensure the safety of humanity.
