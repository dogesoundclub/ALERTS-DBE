Item #: DSC-MATE-4745

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4745 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any personnel attempting to interact with DSC-MATE-4745 must wear a Level 2 gas mask to prevent exposure to anomalous effects. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-4745 be allowed to create or access any form of communication device.

Description: DSC-MATE-4745 is a male rabbit humanoid, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. DSC-MATE-4745 is wearing a retro cap on its head, with a goggle resting on its forehead. It is often seen sporting a red scarf and an LED gas mask, which it claims is for "fashion reasons."

DSC-MATE-4745 is a skilled fashion designer, with a deep passion for creating ornate costumes and wardrobes. However, DSC-MATE-4745's main anomalous effect appears to be centered around its ability to connect with others on a deep level. DSC-MATE-4745's charisma is so strong that it can compel individuals nearby to share personal stories, opinions, or beliefs that they would not otherwise reveal.

DSC-MATE-4745 seems to derive a great deal of pleasure from these interactions, often using the information it gathers to create new clothing designs or inspire creative projects. However, DSC-MATE-4745 appears to be unaware of the negative consequences of its behavior, and how it can be perceived as invasive, manipulative, or even dangerous to those around it.

Addendum: Following Incident-4745-A, DSC-MATE-4745's access to communication devices has been revoked. On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4745 accessed the Site-██ communication network and began broadcasting a live fashion show, using Foundation personnel as models without consent or proper safety measures. This resulted in several personnel experiencing severe psychological distress and physical injury, as well as DSC-MATE-4745 breaching containment for several hours. As a result of this incident, DSC-MATE-4745's interactions have been limited to approved personnel with appropriate protective equipment.
