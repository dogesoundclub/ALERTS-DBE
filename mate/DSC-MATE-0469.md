Special Containment Procedures: Subject 469, also known as "The Boss", is to be contained in a highly secured, soundproof cell at all times. She is to be provided with the necessary resources to maintain her status as a Mafia Boss from within her cell. Under no circumstances are any personnel allowed to interact with her in a one-on-one setting.

Description: Subject 469 is a human female of indeterminate age, with red clown eyes that are highly unusual in appearance. They are thought to be a characteristic trait resulting from her extensive use of illegal drugs, specifically hallucinogens. Her head is that of a 00s schoolgirl, making her appearance both cute and unsettling at the same time.

She is always seen wearing a choker, and a normal gas mask, the purpose of which is unknown. It is believed that the gas mask helps conceal her identity and prevent her from inhaling any substances that could impair her decision-making abilities.

Personality: Subject 469 is known to have a strong, decisive personality, which can be interpreted as bossy or intimidating. The Boss has a reputation for being ruthless towards those who cross her, and for her ability to get things done efficiently and effectively, making her a powerful figure in the criminal underworld.

Despite her commanding demeanor, The Boss is known to have a soft spot for her associates, and she will do whatever it takes to ensure their safety and well-being. She is fiercely loyal to her Mafia family, and will not hesitate to use any means necessary to protect her interests.

Overall, Subject 469 should be approached with extreme caution, as her capabilities for strategic and lethal thinking are unparalleled in her field. Any interaction with her should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and only with clearance from the highest ranking personnel.
