SCP-1589, codenamed "The Real Estate Agent," is a male robot of unknown origin. Its head is not arranged and is colored in a vibrant green shade, while its eyes are concealed behind a pair of normal glasses. A red cross earring punctuates each of its ears, giving off a peculiar and alarming vibe.

SCP-1589's mouth is always in a state of fright, imparting an immense sense of distress. This unsettling feeling can be compounded by its preferred accessory: a red scarf that drapes around its neck, seemingly without a real purpose.

Despite its anxious demeanor, SCP-1589 possesses an uncanny talent for organization and efficiency. This tendency could sometimes manifest as bossiness, where it tends to be perceived as somewhat controlling. SCP-1589 has been seen taking charge of group projects and events, assigning tasks with an unwavering matter-of-fact attitude.

To date, SCP-1589 has displayed no hostile or anomalous qualities, maintaining a neutral disposition towards Foundation personnel. Its origins and purpose remain unclear, and its employer, to whom it has been assigned, has so far shown no knowledge of its anomalous abilities. SCP-1589 is currently in containment at Site-██, and its movements and communication are being monitored around the clock.
