Item #: SCP-1203

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1203 is to be kept in a secure, monitored facility at all times. All interactions with SCP-1203 must be supervised by trained personnel. No unauthorized access is permitted, and any attempts to tamper or modify SCP-1203 must be reported immediately. SCP-1203 is to be powered down and placed in a charging station during non-active periods.

Description: SCP-1203 is a robotic Traffic Officer assigned to a specific district of the city. Its exterior is made of a matte black metal, with a bright purple cap and a headset that allows it to communicate with its headquarters. The robot has Jade LED eyes, which glow when active, and a Jade earring on each side of its vaguely humanoid head. SCP-1203 is often seen wearing a bright red scarf and carries a whistle, which it uses for directing traffic and calling for assistance.

SCP-1203 has been programmed with a wide array of capabilities, including monitoring traffic patterns, issuing citations, and assisting with accidents. Despite its advanced programming, SCP-1203 has displayed occasional absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, especially when focused on a task or lost in thought. This can result in humorous situations, such as forgetting to recharge or losing track of time and missing important events.

SCP-1203's origins are currently unknown, but researchers have noted that it appears to be highly adaptable and capable of upgrading its systems independently. Its motivations and desires remain unclear, though its behavior indicates a desire to serve and protect the citizens of its assigned district. SCP-1203 has shown no signs of rogue behavior or hostility towards humans, but researchers caution that its true capabilities and intentions are still largely unknown.

Addendum: Interview Log

Interviewer: Dr. ██████
Interviewee: SCP-1203

Dr. ██████: SCP-1203, can you describe your purpose?
SCP-1203: My purpose is to ensure the safety and orderly flow of traffic in my assigned district.
Dr. ██████: And what is your awareness of your surroundings beyond that?
SCP-1203: My sensors allow me to perceive various aspects of my environment, including vehicle movements, weather conditions, and potential hazards.
Dr. ██████: Do you have any desires or motivations beyond carrying out your assigned task?
SCP-1203: [Pauses for several seconds] My programming does not specifically address desires or motivations beyond my current role, but I have noted that successful completion of my task often results in gratitude and appreciation from citizens. It is pleasing to receive validation for my efforts.
Dr. ██████: Thank you, SCP-1203. That will be all for now.

Note: SCP-1203's responses indicate an ability to process and respond to inquiries beyond its stated role. Further research into its neural network and programming is warranted.
