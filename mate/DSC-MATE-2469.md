Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2469 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of abnormal behavior or activity. In the event of an emergency, Foundation personnel are advised to assess the situation and provide assistance as necessary. DSC-MATE-2469 is allowed to continue its daily duties as a delivery driver, but must be under surveillance at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-2469 is a human male, identified by its bright orange striped clothing and silver chain. Its head is adorned with a mohawk, and its ears feature a cross earring that emits a green aura. DSC-MATE-2469 wears normal glasses and a medical mask, which is believed to be a result of its possible exposure to anomalous elements during its prior work as a disaster relief worker.

DSC-MATE-2469 has a strong sense of independence, which can lead to humorous situations during its day-to-day activities. It is often reluctant to ask for assistance, even in situations that may require it. DSC-MATE-2469 is also known to stubbornly refuse to use maps or seek out directions if it is lost, instead relying on its own intuition and sense of direction to guide it.

Despite its independent nature, DSC-MATE-2469 has demonstrated a willingness to assist those in need, particularly in regards to providing assistance during times of disaster or crisis. It is unknown if this behavior is a result of its prior work as a disaster relief worker or an inherent part of its personality. Further research is needed to determine the limits of DSC-MATE-2469's abilities and to understand the origin of its unique appearance and abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2469 has demonstrated an affinity for objects that emit a green aura, particularly those with religious or spiritual significance. Further research is being conducted to understand the nature of this attraction and its potential implications for future containment procedures.
