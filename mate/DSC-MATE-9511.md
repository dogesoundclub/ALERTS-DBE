Item #: 9511

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 9511 should be monitored regularly and kept in a secure location when not in use. No unauthorized personnel should approach or interact with 9511 without proper clearance.

Description: 9511 appears to be a Real Estate Agent, but is in fact a robotic being of unknown origin. Its face feature resembles that of a frightened mouth, and its eyes are made of VR Jade LED, which shine a bright green. Additionally, it has a unique green head, which remains in its original state (not arranged). It has a goggle on its forehead and a jade earring on each side of its head, completing its appearance with a silver chain around its neck.

Personality: 9511 has been observed to value tradition and may have a no-nonsense attitude. However, it possesses a playful side, which occasionally leads to humorous situations. The robot has been known to tell jokes or stories passed down through its family or community. It is yet unclear why it has taken an interest in Real Estate, but it has performed adequately so far.

Addendum: 9511 has demonstrated the ability to interact with humans and other entities in ways that suggest a level of sentience beyond simple programming. Its true purpose and origins remain unknown, and further research is necessary to unravel its secrets.
