Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6800 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All contact with SCP-6800 should be limited to Level 3 personnel and above. SCP-6800 is allowed to maintain its occupation as a beautician as long as it does not reveal any anomalous abilities or damage the veil of secrecy surrounding the Foundation.

Description: SCP-6800 is a male human with a distinctive mouth spot and VR Rainbow LED eyes. It wears a purple cap with a headset and a green cross earring on its right ear. SCP-6800 also adorns itself with a red scarf and a normal gas mask.

SCP-6800 has demonstrated a reliable and organized personality, but it can also exhibit stubbornness. It adheres to a strict routine and has difficulty accepting new ideas or changes, which has resulted in humorous situations when faced with unexpected challenges.

SCP-6800's anomalous abilities are currently unknown. Further testing is needed to determine the extent of its abilities and potential threat to the veil of secrecy.

Addendum: Interview Log 6800-1

Dr. ██████: SCP-6800, can you describe any anomalous abilities you may possess?

SCP-6800: I'm not sure what you mean, Doctor. I just work as a beautician.

Dr. ██████: Have you ever experienced any unusual occurrences or events?

SCP-6800: Well, there was that one time when a customer's hair turned neon pink when I styled it.

Dr. ██████: Interesting. Can you recall any other instances like this?

SCP-6800: Not really. I just chalked it up to a new hair dye I was experimenting with.

Dr. ██████: We'll need to conduct further testing to determine the extent of your abilities. Thank you, SCP-6800.

Closing Statement: More research is needed to determine SCP-6800's full extent of abilities and potential danger to the Foundation. Its reliability and organization make it a valuable asset, but its potential for stubbornness could pose a threat to containment efforts.
