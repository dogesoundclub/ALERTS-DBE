SCP-4544 is a humanoid entity classified as a Type-G Green Anomaly. This being is identified as a male human with distinctive orange stripes patterned along his face. It also has a distinctive clown mouth, complete with red clown eyes, that gives off an eerie and unsettling appearance. SCP-4544 is often seen wearing a police cap, gold earring, and gold chain as its accessories.

SCP-4544 is known to possess a strong and decisive personality that is often perceived as bossy and intimidating, especially in situations that require a high degree of efficiency and effectiveness. Its personality and behavior are reportedly driven by the desire to achieve its goals while ensuring that all objectives are met according to protocol.

SCP-4544 was initially discovered working as a programmer in a multinational tech firm.
