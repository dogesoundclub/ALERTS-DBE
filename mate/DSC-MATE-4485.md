Item #: 4485

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their status as a human being and their occupation as a traffic officer, 4485 is allowed to freely move within their designated work area. However, any attempts at entry into restricted areas or threatening the safety of others will result in immediate detention and suitable punishment.

Description: 4485 appears to be a human female of average height and build. Their face is characterized by prominent orange stripes across their cheeks and a bright red lip, accentuating a distinct and bold personality. Their eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology, which can display a variety of colors and patterns.

4485's head is adorned with a blonde ushanka, while their red cross earring stands out on their ears. They are known to have a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when it is necessary. This attribute can lead to some humorous situations, such as attempting to move a heavy piece of furniture by themselves or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost.

Despite their tendencies towards independence, 4485 is known to be a competent and dedicated traffic officer. Their strong sense of duty and responsibility towards upholding the laws and maintaining road safety is commendable.

Further investigation is required to determine any latent anomalous properties, but until then, 4485 remains classified as a human with no significant threats to public safety.
