SCP-1356's mental state is quite unusual for a human. He possesses a high level of analytical and logical skills, and is fond of debates or arguments with others, even about insignificant topics. This characteristic often leads to unexpected arguments and humorous situations.

SCP-1356 has the ability to manipulate customers in a way resulting in purchasing of cars they do not need. It is assumed that this ability is triggered through eye contact with the customer. SCP-1356 is known to produce a subtle change in the voice's tone and facial expressions of the gullible customers, manipulating their decision-making process.

The Foundation is still investigating SCP-1356's abilities and its source. A thorough screening of all sales documents is required to prevent SCP-1356's influence on the customers.

However, due to SCP-1356's unpredictable nature, personnel with a history of workplace or employment issues are strictly prohibited from working with SCP-1356.
