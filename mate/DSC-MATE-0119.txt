SCP-119, also known as "The Rebel Programmer," is a remarkable specimen capable of incredible acts of independence and defiance. Though possessing a humanoid form, this individual boasts some striking physical features not typical of the human race.

SCP-119 is male and has blue clown eyes that stare out from his parted pink head topped with a goggle. The most notable feature of his face is the striking orange stripes that accentuate his smile. These facial markings are more than mere decoration, for they signal the rebellious nature of this individual.

Our observations have confirmed that SCP-119 has a strong sense of independence that they fiercely guard against any perceived infringement by authority. They are prone to acts of defiance, which can range from sneaking out of work early to taking unauthorized days off. It has also been noted that SCP-119 might view some rules as unnecessary, leading them to disregard them entirely.

While the full capabilities of SCP-119 are yet to be fully explored, it is clear that they present a unique and challenging specimen that requires ongoing monitoring.
