Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Identified as Subject 5637, the individual is to be monitored at all times through surveillance cameras placed in public locations where they frequently visit. Any unauthorized access attempts or contact with anomalous entities must be reported and investigated immediately by the Foundation's agents. Subject 5637 is allowed to continue their employment as a reporter in a local newspaper as long as their work doesn't compromise the integrity of the Foundation's concealment protocols or interfere in any way with the containment of anomalous objects and entities.

Description: Subject 5637 is a human female, approximately 25 years of age, with several distinct physical features. The most noticeable are the spotted pattern on their face, which extends from the forehead to the cheeks, and the purple lip coloration. They wear a purple cap with a headset as part of their reporter outfit, along with a silver chain necklace and a pair of jade earrings. Their forehead has a two-color band, which is believed to be cosmetic.

Subject 5637's personality is characterized by a tendency towards absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. They frequently lose track of time when working on a story or when lost in thought, often leading to missed appointments and humorous situations. Nevertheless, they possess a sharp mind and strong investigative skills, which make them a valuable asset to the Foundation's surveillance efforts.

Addendum: In Incident Report 5637-A, Subject 5637 was found in the vicinity of an anomalous object (referred to as SCP-XXXX), which had breached containment and caused a localized reality distortion. The individual had no previous record of involvement with anomalous entities or objects and claimed to have stumbled upon SCP-XXXX while investigating a lead for a story. A thorough investigation of the incident concluded that Subject 5637 was not aware of the nature of SCP-XXXX or intentionally interfering with the Foundation's containment efforts. However, heightened surveillance and restrictions have been put in place to prevent future incidents.
