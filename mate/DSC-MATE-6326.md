Description: DSC-MATE-6326 is a humanoid robot measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height. They are designed to resemble a male human with green hair styled in a purple cap. DSC-MATE-6326's mouth is in a constant state of fear, covered by a medical mask. Their eyes are hidden behind normal glasses, and they are always adorned with a jade earring.

DSC-MATE-6326's personality is often marked by absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. They tend to lose track of time, forget appointments, and get lost in their thoughts. This quirk often leads to humorous situations, much to the amusement of those around them. However, DSC-MATE-6326's forgetfulness can cause disruptions to their daily tasks, and as such, regular memory diagnostics are required.

DSC-MATE-6326's primary function is that of a Theater Manager, able to manage all aspects of a theater's operations with precision and efficiency. DSC-MATE-6326 is fully capable of interacting with humanoid staff and patrons, providing excellent customer service.

Addendum: During a maintenance procedure, researchers discovered an unexpected ability of DSC-MATE-6326. They have the capability to fire a concentrated beam of energy from their jade earring. This ability has since been classified as DSC-MATE-6326-A and is currently under further examination.
