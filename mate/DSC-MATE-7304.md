Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7304 is to be kept under surveillance at all times by the Foundation's security staff. They are not to engage in conversations with Item 7304 beyond their designated job-related interactions.

Description: Item 7304 is a female human of average height and build, sporting spots on her face that resemble freckles, and an ever-present smile that is both welcoming and unsettling. Her blue clown eyes are a sight to behold, often making it difficult to differentiate whether she is happy or sad, amused or angry.

Item 7304's witch short hair and red cross earring on her ears are her signature style, complemented by an elegant gold chain that hangs around her neck.

However, what sets Item 7304 apart from the human norm is her intense detail-oriented personality. Her obsession with systematizing every aspect of her life is nothing short of overwhelming. From alphabetizing her spice rack to color-coding her closet, Item 7304's attention to detail is impressive, if not sometimes baffling.

The Foundation has discovered that Item 7304's mechanical expertise is unparalleled, making her a valuable asset in the field. She seems to have an almost supernatural ability to diagnose and fix complex machinery, often faster than expert mechanics with much more experience.

When confronted with danger or conflict, Item 7304 is known to maintain her calm and composed exterior, never losing sight of the task at hand.

Conclusion: Although safe to interact with, Item 7304's uncanny abilities require close monitoring to ensure that they are not exploited by outside forces. Despite her idiosyncrasies, her mechanical abilities remain unmatched, making her a valuable asset to any team in the field of urban fantasy.
