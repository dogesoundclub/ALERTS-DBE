Item #: SCP-7462

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7462 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber reinforced with materials able to withstand extremely high temperatures. The chamber must be under constant surveillance by at least two trained agents at all times. Any attempts by SCP-7462 to escape must be handled with extreme caution, as it is assumed he is able to manipulate and control fire.

Description: SCP-7462, also known as "The Firestarter", is a male human with distinguishable orange stripes covering his face, as well as a permanent smile. SCP-7462 has green hair that is not naturally arranged, and presents a two-color band on his forehead. 

SCP-7462 displays an extremely analytical and logical personality, deriving enjoyment from debating and arguing. The subject often initiates a discussion surrounding trivial topics that, at their core, hide a deeper meaning. SCP-7462's ability to evoke a strong emotional response in others is unnaturally high, and as such, interactions must be restricted to authorized personnel only. 

SCP-7462 is known to possess the ability to control and manipulate fire, which presents a significant threat. There is evidence to suggest that SCP-7462 has previously acted as a villain, wreaking havoc across several locations. As a result, it is imperative that strict containment protocols are followed at all times. 

Addendum: SCP-7462 has been instrumental in providing key data and understanding of the nature of fire manipulation, and as such, research may be permitted under strict supervision. However, any attempts to gain his trust must be approached with extreme caution.
