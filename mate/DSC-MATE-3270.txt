Item #: SCP-3270

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3270 is to be kept in a standard containment room with reinforced walls to prevent any breaches. The room must have a soundproofing system to prevent any possible symptoms of auditory distortion. SCP-3270 is allowed to move freely within the containment area, but is monitored at all times. Under no circumstances is SCP-3270 allowed to operate any electrical equipment outside of testing.

Description: SCP-3270 is a female human with several unusual physical features. They have small spots scattered across their face and wear red lipstick. SCP-3270's eyes are unnaturally large and have a bright red color, reminiscent of a clown's eyes. SCP-3270's head is that of a pink rabbit, and they have goggles on their forehead. They wear a choker and a normal gas mask.

SCP-3270 is a skilled electrician, but their tendency to rebel against authority has led to several incidents in the past. They enjoy bending the rules to see what will happen, often resulting in humorous situations. However, SCP-3270 is unable to resist the temptation of electrical equipment and has a tendency to break containment to tamper with electrical devices.

SCP-3270 also possesses an ability that has been designated as Severe Auditory Distortion. The subject's ability to perceive sound waves is affected, which results in the subject experiencing auditory hallucinations. These hallucinations can cause physical harm to SCP-3270 if not treated immediately.

Addendum: It is recommended that Electrical engineers with a tendency to rebel are not inducted into the containment of SCP-3270. Any further tampering with the object will result in severe disciplinary action.
