Item #: 1943

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1943 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As SCP-1943 exhibits a level of self-awareness and intelligence, all interactions with the entity must be monitored and recorded by at least one Level 3 personnel. Any attempts made by SCP-1943 to escape its containment should be met with appropriate measures as deemed necessary by Site Security.

Description: SCP-1943 appears to be a male primate of the species Macaca fascicularis, more commonly known as the crab-eating macaque. SCP-1943 is distinguishable from other members of its species by its heavily adorned appearance. SCP-1943 wears a pair of blue clown eyes, a jade earring in its left ear, a gold chain around its neck, and carries a candy stick in its hand. SCP-1943 also exhibits a constant expression of fear, with its mouth almost always slightly open.

SCP-1943 works as a banker, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards his job. However, SCP-1943 also has a playful personality and is frequently known to break out into song or dance, often bringing joy to those around him. It is believed that SCP-1943's jovial nature is directly linked to his tendency to collect items and accessories.

SCP-1943 is capable of communicating with personnel through sign language and has expressed a desire to be released from containment. However, due to the highly unpredictable nature of SCP-1943's behavior, containment is deemed necessary for the safety of both SCP-1943 and any potential bystanders.

SCP-1943 was recovered from a bank in the downtown area of ████████, where it had been working as a teller. Its anomalous properties were discovered after several witnesses reported seeing SCP-1943 levitating objects within the bank without physical contact. Following subsequent testing and evaluation, SCP-1943 was transferred to Site-██ for long-term containment. 

Addendum: Testing has revealed that SCP-1943 has a unique brain structure, indicating possible anomalous genetic alteration. Further research into SCP-1943's origins and the extent of its anomalous abilities is ongoing.
