Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be kept within a reinforced metal cage, lined with lead to prevent psychic disturbances. The cage must be sprayed with lavender oil to prevent the rabbit from experiencing emotional distress. Any personnel approaching the cage must be equipped with hazmat suits and prepared to handle psychic disturbances. Any information received from the subject must be verified and cross-checked with other sources.

Description: Subject is a male rabbit that stands out from others in its species due to its peculiar appearance. The rabbit’s face features a perpetually frightened mouth, while its eyes are blue, with the appearance of clown-like makeup around them. The rabbit’s ears have a gold earring, and the rabbit is often seen wearing a red scarf and an LED gas mask.

The subject displays a unique psychic ability that sets it apart from other rabbits. The rabbit seems to possess intuition and can predict future events or sense when someone is going through emotional turmoil. This uncanny ability can be impressive, but it does sometimes unnerve those around the rabbit.

Personality: The subject has a unique and sometimes unsettling personality. It exists in a constant state of anxiety, which can create insecurity in those around it. It often acts awkwardly, and its psychic abilities frequently unnerve those around it. Despite this, the rabbit is known to be empathetic and caring, often going out of its way to help those in need.

The subject is a real estate agent by profession, and its psychic abilities have given it an edge in the business. However, it is advised to be cautious when dealing with the rabbit, as its emotions may cause it to act irrationally.

Addendum: During the latest psychological evaluation, the subject displayed signs of an extreme personality shift. It became aggressive and violent towards its caregivers, displaying a new psychic ability to manipulate emotions to incite others to harm it. Henceforth, subjects' containment procedures have been upgraded to the highest safety protocols.
