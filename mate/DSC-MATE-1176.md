Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1176 is to be held in a maximum-security detention center, with constant surveillance by Level 3 security staff. Interaction with DSC-MATE-1176 must be limited to authorized personnel only. Any attempt to contact the subject without prior approval from site administrators will be met with immediate disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-1176 is a human male in his mid-thirties, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. They present themselves as a successful Mafia boss, claiming ownership over several criminal organizations across the city. DSC-MATE-1176's facial features consist of a wide and insincere smile, ski goggle-shaped eyes, and a medical mask over their mouth. A gold earring is visible on their left ear, and they frequently don a short peak cap, with a goggle fixed on their forehead.

DSC-MATE-1176 exhibit signs of extreme control over their conduct, relentlessly searching to fulfill their responsibilities and their duty at all times. They have an overdeveloped sense of accountability, leading to instances where they assign themselves with tasks beyond their capabilities. This has led to several comical situations, such as tripping over their own feet, or overly committal attempts to lift heavy objects.

DSC-MATE-1176 has repeatedly expressed a desire to maintain their criminal empire's security and prosperity, often appearing in public to make a show of their fearlessness and success. Their actual motivations and true intentions are still unclear, but it is suspected that they have ties to several other anomalies.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1176's gold chain is to be removed and stored in a secure locker. Testing has revealed that its removal limits the subject's emotional stability and reactions to security protocols. Further analysis is in progress.
