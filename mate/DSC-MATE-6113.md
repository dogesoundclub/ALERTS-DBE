Item #: 6113

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:  Subject 6113 is to be monitored at all times via CCTV in his designated area of employment, which is to remain within a 5-mile radius of Foundation headquarters. Any attempts by 6113 to leave this radius must be intercepted and redirected. Contact with civilians is strictly forbidden, and any attempt made to create or maintain social connections to outsiders will result in immediate relocation and/or termination of Subject 6113.

Description: Subject 6113, a fast food worker of the human species, is easily recognizable by his notable face features; orange stripes marking his cheeks and a permanent, seemingly endless smile. He adorns a bucket hat and a green cross earring, with a standard gas mask being his preferred accessory. The gas mask serves to conceal his features while he is on the job, as exposure to crowds can trigger his anomalous properties.

Subject 6113's effect is not yet clearly understood, but they are believed to be capable of establishing deep socio-emotional connections with individuals. They value harmony and social connections and their awkward, oftentimes goofy demeanor leads to humorous interactions with those around them.

Caution is advised when dealing with Subject 6113, as a sudden outburst of emotion may trigger their anomalous ability. Social restraint is key as the Foundation continues its ongoing research into the nature of this individual's abilities.

Addendum 1: On ██/██/████, Subject 6113 attempted to establish a connection with a young girl passing through his drive-thru location. Foundation personnel immediately intervened, terminating Subject 6113 with extreme prejudice. Further testing of 6113's anomalous properties is ongoing.
