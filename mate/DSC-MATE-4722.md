Item #: DSC-MATE-4722

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4722 is to be contained within Site-23's Humanoid Containment Wing. They are to be permitted access to the facility's training gym and common areas in their off-duty hours, but all visitors must wear appropriate eye protection to avoid contact with DSC-MATE-4722's anomalous ocular features. Due to the individual's occupation as a firefighter, they are permitted to leave the site during emergency situations as deemed necessary.

Description: DSC-MATE-4722 is a female human with an unusual eye condition, resulting in both eyes resembling those of a clown. The individual stands at 1.68 meters and weighs approximately 70 kilograms. DSC-MATE-4722's head is consistently styled in a short haircut, and they wear a medical mask over their mouth. Their ears bear gold earrings, and they often wear a choker necklace.

DSC-MATE-4722 is known for their quick wit and love of debate, which they often use to engage in playful arguments with friends and family members. The individual has demonstrated a good sense of humor, but their anomalous eye appearance can sometimes elicit negative reactions from those who are unaware of DSC-MATE-4722's containment status.

As part of their occupation as a firefighter, DSC-MATE-4722 has undergone extensive physical training and shows no signs of anomalous abilities beyond their ocular condition. However, they have expressed an affinity for fire suppression and firefighting tactics.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4722 was brought to the Foundation's attention following a routine physical exam, during which their anomalous eye condition was discovered. DSC-MATE-4722 was then apprehended and brought to Site-23 for further study and containment. Despite some initial resistance to containment measures, DSC-MATE-4722 has since acclimated to their new environment and poses no immediate threat to personnel.
