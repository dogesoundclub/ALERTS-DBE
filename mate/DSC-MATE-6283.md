Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6283 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with access to basic amenities such as food, water, and shelter. Research personnel wishing to interact with DSC-MATE-6283 must first seek approval from the site director and be knowledgeable in primate behavioral psychology. DSC-MATE-6283 is to be kept away from any form of technology, as they have been shown to have an affinity for repairing electronics in unconventional ways. Any objects brought into close proximity to DSC-MATE-6283 must first be inspected for unauthorized modifications.

Description: DSC-MATE-6283 is a male primate that closely resembles a colobus monkey (Colobus guereza). It stands approximately 0.91 meters (3 feet) tall and weighs approximately 22.68 kilograms (50 pounds). DSC-MATE-6283 displays unique facial features, including a frightened mouth and normal glasses covering its eyes. It can often be seen wearing a Doge hat on its head, as well as a gold earring in one ear, a red scarf around its neck, and a candy stick in its hand.

DSC-MATE-6283 displays a highly practical and hands-on personality, often attempting to fix broken items in unconventional ways using duct tape, paper clips, or other materials at its disposal. This behavior is believed to stem from DSC-MATE-6283's natural resourcefulness and problem-solving skills, which are amplified by its unusual intelligence.

DSC-MATE-6283 was discovered after several reports of a "monkey banker" surfaced in the news. Upon further investigation, Foundation personnel determined that DSC-MATE-6283 had gained access to a local bank and had been observed repairing a broken ATM machine. It is believed that DSC-MATE-6283 had been living undetected in the bank for several weeks prior to this discovery.

Addendum: Interview Log

Following a successful behavior modification test, research personnel were able to conduct an interview with DSC-MATE-6283.

Dr. ██████: Good morning, DSC-MATE-6283. How are you feeling today?

DSC-MATE-6283: (breathes heavily) I'm fine, thank you. Can we get started?

Dr. ██████: I see. Do you have any other talents or abilities that we should be aware of?

DSC-MATE-6283: (pauses) Not really. I just like to fix things. It's what I do.

Dr. ██████: Well, thank you for your time today, DSC-MATE-6283. We'll be in touch soon.
