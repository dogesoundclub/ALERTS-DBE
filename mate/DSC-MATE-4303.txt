SCP-4303 is a veterinarian who possesses an uncanny ability for leadership. As a human male, he stands tall amongst others but it's his distinct facial features that draw attention. Tiny spots peppering his skin and his permanent smile leave those around him feeling both comforted and unnerved.

Eyes the color of freshly drawn blood, framed by bold bushy eyebrows accentuated by a single peak spike that ascends towards the forehead, give off an air of command. A diamond-studded pinky ring on a left hand that sports a jade earring, adds to the image of intimidation. The sight of SCP-4303 in a medical mask only adds to the unsettling nature of his appearance.

Often found wearing a gold chain with a prominent medallion, SCP-4303 conveys an air of authority even outside of his professional setting. With the capacity to take control of situations, his confidence and charisma have more than once saved the lives of the very animals he tends to.

SCP-4303 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, as his commanding presence extends beyond his occupation, and he is capable of turning the tides of almost any situation.
