Item #: SCP-8099

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8099 is to be kept in a standard human containment chamber at Site-19. The subject should be under constant surveillance for any sudden emotional outbursts or unpredictable behavior. Access to SCP-8099's office should be granted only to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, and all visitors must be screened for any emotional imbalances beforehand. SCP-8099 is allowed to continue working as a veterinarian with regular psychological evaluations.

Description: SCP-8099 is a female human with distinctive facial spots. They sport normal glasses, short witch-like hair, and are often seen wearing a silver chain and jade earring with a cigarette in their hand. SCP-8099 exhibits a tendency towards impulsive behavior and often acts on their emotions rather than thinking things through. This can lead to amusing situations for others, but also puts the subject at risk of making poor decisions.

SCP-8099's profession as a veterinarian has allowed them to come into contact with numerous animals, both mundane and anomalous, and display an unusual level of empathy towards them. However, the subject has been known to neglect their own well-being in favor of helping their patients. Despite this, SCP-8099 has maintained a positive and outgoing personality, often making jokes and engaging in lighthearted banter with those they come into contact with.

While SCP-8099 has shown no signs of being anomalous, their impulsive nature and empathic abilities warrant continued observation.

Addendum: During a routine psychological evaluation, SCP-8099 expressed a desire to work with anomalous animals more frequently, citing a need to "help those who cannot help themselves." It is recommended that further testing be conducted to determine if the subject's emotional state may be influenced by their exposure to such individuals.
