Item #: SCP-918

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-918 is to be kept in a secure containment area at all times. The subject must be restrained with handcuffs, and all visitors must wear Level 4 biohazard suits. Any physical contact with SCP-918 is strictly prohibited. Only Level 4 personnel are authorized to enter SCP-918's containment area.

Description: SCP-918 is a human male who was formerly a police officer. He possesses a distinct mouth spot on his left cheek and a frightened expression on his mouth. His eyes are red clown eyes, a phenomenon that is still unexplained. His head is shaved and he bears the visage of a monk. SCP-918 also wears a gold earring on his right ear.

SCP-918's personality is characterized by idealism and a strong desire to make the world a better place. However, this can lead to some humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that goes against his values. SCP-918 is known to have an aversion to anything that he perceives as immoral or unethical and is prone to fits of moral outrage.

SCP-918's anomalous properties manifest in his ability to produce a strong, contagious psychosomatic effect. Individuals who come into physical contact with SCP-918 or are in close proximity to him are compelled to adopt SCP-918's values and beliefs. These effects are most potent in those with strong moral convictions. Exposure to SCP-918 over a prolonged period can result in severe psychological and behavioral changes in affected individuals, causing a cult-like devotion to SCP-918's ideology.

SCP-918 was discovered after a group of people reported experiencing sudden ideological changes after interacting with SCP-918, prompting an immediate containment operation. Further studies will be conducted to understand the extent and nature of SCP-918's anomalous properties.

Addendum: O5 Command recommends the use of amnestics for any individuals who have had contact with SCP-918. This is to prevent any possible spread of his anomalous effect. Surgery to remove SCP-918's mouth spot has been proposed as a possible long-term solution, but this is yet to be approved by Ethics Committee. Monitoring of SCP-918 is ongoing.
