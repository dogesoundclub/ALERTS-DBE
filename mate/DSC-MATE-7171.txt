Description: SCP-7171 is a male human of Caribbean descent with orange stripes on his cheeks. The subject wears a red beanie on his head, goggles on his forehead, and a gold earring on his left ear. His eyes are brightly lit with VR rainbow LED lights. SCP-7171 also wears a gold chain necklace and regularly smokes cigarettes.

SCP-7171 is a friendly and easy-going individual who works as a farmer. Despite his laid-back personality, SCP-7171 is fiercely protective of his loved ones and will not hesitate to confront those who insult or harm them. This determination has led to some comical situations, as SCP-7171 can become quite passionate when defending his family and friends.

When interviewed, SCP-7171 seemed unaware of his anomalous nature and appeared confused when prompted about his unique features. The subject claimed that he was simply living his life and never considered himself to be different from others.

Addendum: After the initial classification of SCP-7171, Foundation personnel conducted an investigation into the subject's background. It is suspected that SCP-7171 may be descended from individuals with anomalous genetic traits, as his family members reportedly share similar physical features. However, further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
