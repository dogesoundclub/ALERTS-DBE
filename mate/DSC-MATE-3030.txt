Item #: SCP-3030

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3030 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with a minimum of 8 ft of vertical space, branches and other objects for climbing, and a variety of objects for entertainment. The tail hole in the back of the jumpsuits provided should be left open for SCP-3030 to use. Any beautician tools or materials should be carefully screened before being allowed in SCP-3030's chamber.

Description: SCP-3030 is a male monkey, approximately 1 meter in height when standing upright. It typically wears a retro cap with a 2 color band across its forehead and a jade earring in each ear. SCP-3030 is notably fearful, and its mouth is almost always open in a frightened expression. It is known to be fluent in many languages and has shown an aptitude for cosmetology, particularly hairstyling and makeup.

SCP-3030's most unusual feature is its LED gas mask accessory, which has a number of unknown functions, although it is believed to offer protection from certain types of environmental or supernatural hazards. In addition, SCP-3030 has a strong sense of independence and will often disobey or disregard orders it considers unnecessary. It is known to have rebelled against authority by sneaking out of its containment chamber or taking unauthorized days off work.

Addendum: SCP-3030 is believed to have had a previous owner who may have been involved in anomalous activities. It is important that researchers continue to investigate SCP-3030's origins and any connections it may have to the occult or anomalous communities.
