SCP Foundation File: SCP-980 "The Joker Bunny"

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-980 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell with reinforced walls and no windows. Personnel are strictly forbidden from engaging in conversation with SCP-980 without prior approval from at least one Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-980 appears to be a female human with red clown eyes, a pink rabbit head, and a medical mask covering her mouth. She wears a goggle on her forehead and gold earrings on her ears. Despite her unusual appearance, SCP-980 displays high levels of intelligence and cunning. She has shown herself to be a skilled and ruthless villain, using her powers of manipulation and persuasion to turn even the most loyal of individuals into her pawns.

SCP-980 has a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. Her deadpan jokes are often surprisingly funny, although they frequently involve cruel and twisted humor. SCP-980 has a sadistic streak that she enjoys indulging. She takes pleasure in causing pain and suffering, often using her humor and wit to torture her victims emotionally as well as physically.

SCP-980 is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and her physical strength is far greater than that of a normal human. She has displayed the ability to move incredibly quickly and to dodge attacks with ease. SCP-980 is also capable of generating hallucinations, which she uses to disorient her opponents and make them easier to defeat.

SCP-980 poses a significant threat to Foundation personnel and should be considered extremely dangerous at all times. Any interactions with her must be carefully monitored and controlled to minimize the risk of her escape.
