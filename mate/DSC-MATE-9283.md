Subject 9283, also known as "The Farmer," is a curious human female with striking orange stripes on her face. Her unsettling red clown eyes are a constant reminder of her unpredictable nature. Her head has an eerie resemblance to an average 00s schoolgirl, which is a stark contrast to her eccentric personality. 

Subject 9283 is always seen wearing her gold chain, which she claims brings her good luck. She also constantly has a cigarette in hand, which she uses to channel her thoughts and ideas. 

Despite her unusual appearance, The Farmer is a clever and observant individual. She has an insatiable thirst for knowledge and often finds herself engrossed in obscure topics. This thirst for knowledge can lead to some bizarre situations, such as randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to unsuspecting listeners. 

It is important to note that while The Farmer may seem quirky and lighthearted, she should not be underestimated. Her shrewd mind and cunning nature make her a force to be reckoned with. She is not to be trifled with, and those who cross her should prepare for the consequences.
