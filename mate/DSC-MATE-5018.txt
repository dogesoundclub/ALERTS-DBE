Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5018 is to be monitored while working at his designated fast food establishment. Any notable changes in behavior should be reported to the Site Supervisor immediately for further evaluation. Interaction with 5018 should be minimal and kept strictly professional.

Description: Subject 5018 is a male human of average height and build, with blue clown eyes that possess an unsettling quality. He often wears a retro cap with a gold earring and a silver chain as accessories. One of the most notable features of the subject is his smile, which is often described as being unnervingly wide.

Subject 5018 has a strong sense of independence and is often reluctant to seek help, even when it is clear that he needs it. This has led to numerous humorous situations where he has attempted to move a heavy piece of furniture on his own or stubbornly refused to use a map when he was clearly lost. Despite his stubbornness, he is a dedicated and hardworking fast food worker, often going above and beyond his job requirements.

Analysis: The origin of Subject 5018's unique eye color and unsettling smile are currently unknown. It is also unclear if his strong sense of independence is a natural personality trait or if it has been influenced by an external factor. Further examination of the subject's background may yield more information.

Conclusion: Subject 5018 poses no immediate threat and can safely continue his employment as a fast food worker. Further monitoring and analysis are recommended to determine the cause of his unique features and personality traits.
