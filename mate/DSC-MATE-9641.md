Object Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9641 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a temperature range of 20-24 C and at least two security cameras monitoring the chamber at all times. DSC-MATE-9641 is to be provided with a red scarf and allowed to keep its red cross earring and normal glasses as long as they pose no threat. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-9641 be allowed to interact with any inanimate objects or any humanoid entities with nurturing or caring tendencies.

Description: DSC-MATE-9641 is a juvenile male tiger in its early twenties, standing at 6'2" and weighing approximately 200 kg. DSC-MATE-9641 has been genetically modified to possess humanoid characteristics, including opposable thumbs, the ability to stand upright, and human-level intelligence. DSC-MATE-9641 has demonstrated the ability to communicate verbally in multiple languages, including English, Mandarin, and Spanish, and is currently employed as a programmer at [REDACTED].

DSC-MATE-9641 possesses a highly nurturing personality, which extends to inanimate objects as well. DSC-MATE-9641 has been observed giving names and personal attributes to its car, plants, and even household appliances. DSC-MATE-9641 has a strong attachment to its red scarf and red cross earring, which it wears at all times. It is currently unknown how these accessories affect DSC-MATE-9641's behavior.

DSC-MATE-9641 poses a potential threat to the Foundation due to its ability to develop bonds and create attachments with inanimate objects. DSC-MATE-9641 may attempt to break containment in order to protect or interact with these objects, leading to a potential breach of security. Due to the unpredictable nature of DSC-MATE-9641's behavior, all personnel are advised to maintain a minimum safe distance of 3 meters when interacting with DSC-MATE-9641.

Addendum: Incident 9641-A

On [REDACTED], DSC-MATE-9641 was discovered anthropomorphizing a computer program it was working on, showing emotional distress when the program encountered code errors. DSC personnel quickly intervened and removed DSC-MATE-9641 from the area, following protocol to prevent contamination of the Foundation's computer systems. DSC-MATE-9641 was reassigned to a non-programming position and is currently undergoing psychological evaluations.
