SCP-5961 is a humanoid entity classified as a "Beautician" due to her occupation as a professional makeup artist. Her appearance is striking: the subject's face is adorned with spots and a dramatic purple lip, while her eyes are an unnerving shade of red with a sickly clown-like glow. SCP-5961's head is colored a bright green hue, and her hair is stylistically curled with sharp, jagged edges. The subject's ears are pierced with a green cross earring, and she frequently dons a black choker necklace.

Despite her eccentric appearance, SCP-5961 is intelligent and analytical, often approaching situations with a logical and calculated thought process. She has been noted to enjoy making witty observations or teasing her acquaintances with a dry, deadpan sense of humor. SCP-5961's unique personality has been viewed as both charming and intimidating by those who interact with her.

While SCP-5961's anomalous properties are still under investigation, the subject has not displayed any hostile behavior and has cooperated fully with Foundation agents. It is recommended that interaction with SCP-5961 remains limited to cases involving her professional duties, with any further socialization being strictly monitored.
