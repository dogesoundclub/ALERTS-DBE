Description: DSC-MATE-1417 is a human male with sporadic spots on their face and a constant smile. DSC-MATE-1417's eyes are replaced with VR Jade LED screens, suggesting an implant or prosthetic. DSC-MATE-1417 is also known for wearing a blue bandana around their head and a pair of goggles on their forehead. Their ears are adorned with a green cross earring, and they are often seen wearing a silver chain.

DSC-MATE-1417 displays a highly introspective personality, often getting lost in their thoughts or daydreaming. This can lead to humorous situations, such as walking into a pole or tripping over objects. DSC-MATE-1417's introspective personality suggests that their mind may be susceptible to outside intrusion or manipulation.

DSC-MATE-1417's delivery job makes them an ideal candidate for transporting anomalous objects. However, their easily distracted personality presents a risk for containment breaches. DSC-MATE-1417 should only be assigned to deliver low-risk items, with high-risk items being entrusted to more stable personnel.

Addendum 1417-A: DSC-MATE-1417's Jade LED screens have been examined and found to have an unknown but highly advanced technology. Examination of DSC-MATE-1417's cranial implant has been denied by DSC-MATE-1417 themselves, citing personal reasons. Further research into these implants is ongoing.
