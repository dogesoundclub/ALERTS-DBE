Item #: SCP-7152

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7152 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Under no circumstances should any personnel enter SCP-7152's chamber without proper authorization and escort by no fewer than two armed guards.

SCP-7152 is to be allowed access to legal materials and a personal computer for work purposes, but all communications must be monitored for any potential attempts to escape or cause harm. All requests for additional equipment or personal items must be reviewed and approved by Level 4 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-7152 appears to be a fully grown male tiger with a frightened expression and blue bandana covering its head. Additionally, SCP-7152 has a red cross earring in each ear, a red scarf around his neck, and a whistle hanging from its neck.

SCP-7152 has the ability to speak fluent English and claims to be a licensed lawyer. It states that it is aware of its unusual appearance and claims that it has been caused by a curse. Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-7152 appears to be docile and compliant with Foundation personnel.

SCP-7152 displays a strong sense of independence and reluctance to ask for help, even when it is clear that assistance is needed. This behavior can be witnessed as SCP-7152 attempts to accomplish tasks such as moving heavy objects or finding its way without a map. While often humorous, this behavior can also lead to potentially dangerous situations.

Addendum: SCP-7152 has demonstrated a unique ability to manipulate legal proceedings to its benefit, often resulting in favorable outcomes for itself. Personnel are to exercise caution when engaging in any legal discussions with SCP-7152 and to closely monitor any signed documents for potential anomalies. Any successful legal proceedings orchestrated by SCP-7152 are to be investigated thoroughly for any possible SCP Foundation breaches.
