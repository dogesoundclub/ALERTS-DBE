Item #: SCP-8119

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8119 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-8119 are to be conducted with at least two personnel present at all times, and any requests made by SCP-8119 must be approved by the site director.

Description: SCP-8119 is a human male standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height, identified as a real estate agent by his personal documentation. SCP-8119's face is covered with spots resembling those of a Dalmatian, accentuated by his red clown eyes. SCP-8119 commonly wears a hat bearing the meme of the Shiba Inu dog breed, and accessorizes with a gold chain and a candy stick.

SCP-8119 displays an anomalous ability to naturally take charge of situations, exhibiting exceptional leadership skills in both professional and personal settings. Those in proximity to SCP-8119 often find themselves following his directives, despite possible inconsistencies with their own beliefs or agendas.

SCP-8119's mental state is to be assessed on a regular basis to ensure his ability is not being used for malicious purposes. Any deviation from SCP-8119's established personality profile warrants immediate intervention and recontainment. Personnel interacting with SCP-8119 should avoid making direct eye contact, as there is a possibility for SCP-8119's anomalous effect to extend beyond verbal interactions.

It is currently unknown how SCP-8119 acquired his abilities, or if there are any limitations to his control. Further research into the nature of SCP-8119's anomaly is ongoing.
