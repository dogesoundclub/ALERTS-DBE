Item #: 1878

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1878 is to be monitored at all times through various undercover agents employed within the real estate industry. All attempts to interact directly with Subject 1878 should be avoided at all costs. Engaging Subject 1878 may provoke a dangerous emotional response. A low-level electromagnetic pulse is to be activated within a 200-meter radius around the subject to prevent any unwanted, uncontrolled emotional outbursts.

Description:

Subject 1878 appears to be a typical, middle-aged male Caucasian of average height and weight, with a unique appearance that is the result of his bizarre, yet seemingly natural, physical features. The subject has bright orange stripes that run down his face, along with a crooked smile and piercing blue clown eyes. The subject constantly wears a gas mask, which has the effect of lending a sinister aura to his overall appearance.

Despite his strange appearance, Subject 1878 possesses a strong emotional depth and an intuitive sense of the emotional states of others. Extensive psychological testing has confirmed that the subject is capable of empathizing with others to an extreme degree, often to the point of shedding tears or undergoing emotional outbursts. This tendency is especially noticeable when the subject witnesses the suffering of others and animals, with even unverified reports of latent powers that can cause physical harm to those perceived as causing harm to others.

The subject is known to have connections within the real estate industry, often utilizing his emotional powers to land deals that would otherwise be impossible. The frequent use of his powers and sensibilities may also stem from some deeper knowledge or influence beyond what is currently known, possibly of magical or eldritch origin.

While Subject 1878 appears to be relatively benign, the potential for extremely destructive actions should not be underestimated, and as a result, the low-level EMP is to remain active and the subject's movements closely monitored. 

Note from Dr. ███████:

"Subject 1878 is an enigma among SCPs, possessing a form of empathy that is never found elsewhere. We must observe this subject in a controlled environment to understand the true extent of their abilities."
