Item #: 2998

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2998 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. If the subject must be transported, the use of restraints and sedatives is authorized. Subject 2998 is not to be approached without proper protective gear due to the hazardous nature of her mask.

Description: Subject 2998, identified by records as a human female farmer, displays unique physical characteristics. She bears distinctive spots on her face, paired with a bright red lip. On her head, she wears a purple cap that contrasts with her vibrant green hair. She is often seen wearing a gold chain necklace, and most strikingly, an LED gas mask that obscures her facial features.

Personality-wise, subject 2998 displays a natural inclination towards leadership. She often finds herself taking control of various situations, whether at work or in her personal life. It is unclear if this tendency stems from inherent personality traits or if it is a byproduct of her anomalous objects. Due to the subject's hazardous qualities, extensive research into her masks and devices is ongoing.

Addendum: Subject 2998 has shown minor changes in behavior after prolonged containment. She seems to have adapted to her circumstances, focusing more on self-care and organization. However, due to the subject's unpredictable and aggressive nature, Personnel must maintain caution when interacting with her. Further research is needed to determine the full extent of the subject's abilities and limitations.
