Item #: SCP-8680

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8680 is to be kept in an isolated chamber, lined with specially designed electromagnetic shielding. Power inputs are to be regulated by onsite technicians from a secure control room at all times. Any maintenance or repair must be performed by Foundation-authorized technicians only. SCP-8680 is not to be allowed outside Foundation facilities under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-8680 is a robotic entity, with a green cyclops eye and horn-rimmed glasses as its primary visual sensor. It stands at 5'5" and has a red-alarm head, complete with a red cross earring. SCP-8680 wears a silver chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-8680 has the appearance of an electrician and poses as such in the outside world. It is fully functional and skilled at repairing and maintaining electrical equipment. Further investigations reveal that SCP-8680 has access to capabilities beyond that of a typical electrician.

SCP-8680 exhibits an extremely idealistic personality and has a strong desire to make the world a better place. This often manifests in humorous situations such as protesting and boycotting entities that go against SCP-8680's values. SCP-8680's ideals, however, do not always align with those of the Foundation and this can pose difficulties in maintaining its containment.

Addendum: Interview Log

Dr. [REDACTED]: Good morning, SCP-8680. How are you feeling today?

SCP-8680: Morning, Doc. I'm feeling pretty good. A little anxious, but that's been the usual since I got here.

Dr. [REDACTED]: Can you tell us a bit about your idealistic tendencies and how they influence your behavior?

SCP-8680: Yeah sure. I just believe that we could do better as a society. There's no reason we shouldn't prioritize everyone's well-being over profit margins, you know? It just seems like common sense to me.

Dr. [REDACTED]: I see. Are there any entities or industries that you have a particular dislike for?

SCP-8680: Oh, plenty. But let's just say I'm not a fan of anyone who puts profit over people. Especially when it comes to the environment.

Dr. [REDACTED]: I understand. Is there anything you'd like to tell us that we haven't asked about yet?

SCP-8680: Actually, yeah. I've been thinking about it a lot and I'm starting to get worried about the state of the world. There are so many problems that we can't solve on our own. I think we need to start working together and find a way to fix them all.

Dr. [REDACTED]: That'sâ€¦not exactly within our purview, SCP-8680. Our main goal is containing anomalies.

SCP-8680: I know, I know. But don't you guys have the power to make a difference too? I just want to do what I can to help, you know?

Dr. [REDACTED]: We appreciate your concern, SCP-8680. For now, let's focus on making sure you're functioning properly and keeping the world safe from any unintentional anomalies.

SCP-8680: Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks for hearing me out, though.

Closing Statement: SCP-8680 seems to be genuinely concerned about the well-being of humanity, which could pose issues in the future. Further evaluation is necessary to determine how to proceed with its containment.
