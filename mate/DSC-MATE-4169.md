Item #: 4169

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4169 is currently employed as a Police Officer with no reports of anomalous activity. However, close monitoring is necessary to prevent any potential divergence. If any unusual activities are observed, immediate containment is required.

Description: Subject 4169 is a female human, with a unique physical appearance that features spots on her face and a perpetual smile. Her unmistakeable orange eyebrows and colorful forehead band showcase her individualistic style, which our researchers trace back to 00s school girl aesthetics. The subject also wears jade earrings and is constant seen smoking a cigarette.

While the subject’s physical attributes are unique, what sets her apart is her personality. She is largely organized and a meticulous planner, but with a spontaneous streak that has caused a handful of memorable anomalies. Her spontaneous side finds pleasure in surprising her friends with impromptu adventures, and her last-minute party plans always turn out to be massive hits.

When asked about her true motivation for her palpable ambiguity, subject 4169 simply replied: “a little mystery keeps life worth living."

Addendum: After reports of a missing person, subject 4169 was found to have inadvertently solved the crime by following a hunch. While the police authorities were initially skeptical of the subject's unconventional methods, the victim's safe return successfully cleared the subject of any suspicion, proving that, at times, unconventional methods are necessary to solve even the most mundane of problems.

She has been put on record for future consideration for the anomalous objects division of the DSC foundation.
