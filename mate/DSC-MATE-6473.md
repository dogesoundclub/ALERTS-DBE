Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6473 is to be allowed free assignment to their duties as theater manager. Any attempts to limit their creative output may result in adverse effects upon the subject's behavior. Access to performance spaces should be restricted to the subject and their assigned staff only. No attempted contact with outdoor interests is to be made, as the subject is known to become highly agitated with interruptions.

Description: 

Subject 6473 presents as a human male, with distinct facial features. The subject is often seen wearing a Short Peak Cap atop their head and a Medical Mask over their mouth, which are to be considered part of their daily uniform. Their bright smile is consistently visible beneath their mask, and the subject can often be seen interacting with co-workers in a friendly and engaging manner.

Forehead feature #1 consists of a two-color band, which may indicate some favor or preference for specific artistic movements. The subject possesses green Cross Earrings, which have been evaluated as harmless and purely decorative. The subject also wears a Red Scarf, which serves as an identifying mark for their rank as theater manager.

The subject has been evaluated as highly creative, with a penchant for unusual hobbies and interests. They have been known to indulge in cosplay, writing poetry, and collecting strange objects in their free time. These pursuits do not appear to affect their performance as a theater manager, but should be monitored in the event of any indications of obsessive or compulsive behavior.

Addendum: Subject 6473 has exhibited a propensity for attracting anomalous entities and creatures to the performance spaces under their management. Though there have been no recorded breaches or incidents, a review of containment measures for nearby entities should be scheduled to safeguard the theater's patrons and employees.
