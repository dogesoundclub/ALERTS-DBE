SCP-3262, also known as "The Lawyer," is a human male of unknown origin with striking features that are both intriguing and unsettling to those who meet him. His most notable feature is the "Mouth Spot," a dark circle that appears on his cheek when he is stressed or angry. Additionally, he has a "Clown Mouth," which gives the impression of a permanent, Cheshire-cat-like grin. 

The Lawyer's blue, clown-like eyes only serve to increase his enigmatic presence. He is commonly seen wearing a bucket hat, which seems to add to his mystique. However, his mouth is always covered by a medical mask, which for purposes of containment, shall not be removed under any circumstances. 

The Lawyer possesses a unique personality that manifests itself in different ways. He is highly intelligent, quick-witted, and perceptive. His intellectual capacity is matched by his artistic ability, and he can often be found indulging in various creative hobbies such as painting, drawing, or writing. This creativity also lends itself to his work as an attorney, as he has a knack for crafting compelling legal arguments.

Despite his many talents, The Lawyer is not without his quirks. He is generally viewed as an introverted, secretive individual who keeps to himself. He can come across as aloof or cold, but those who take the time to get to know him often find him friendly and engaging.

As with all SCPs, it is important to approach The Lawyer with caution. He is a master of language and persuasion, and his motives may not always be transparent. However, with proper containment and monitoring, The Lawyer can be a valuable asset to any organization in need of legal representation or artistic expertise.
