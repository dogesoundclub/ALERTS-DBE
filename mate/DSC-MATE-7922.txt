Description:

SCP-7922 is a human male with a unique appearance. He has a spot located on his mouth and a constant smile, giving him an approachable attitude. However, his red clown eyes can be unsettling to some. SCP-7922 wears a purple cap with a headset, a goggle on his forehead, a gold earring, and a red scarf. He is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7922's personality is a mixture of traditional values and a playful demeanor. He enjoys telling jokes and stories passed down through his family and community. SCP-7922 can have a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to security, making him a valuable asset to the Foundation. Despite his humorous behavior, he takes his job seriously.

SCP-7922 has no anomalous properties and is of no danger to the Foundation or the public. However, personnel must be aware of his likeliness to attention-seek and use humor as a way to diffuse situations. SCP-7922 is cooperative but may require monitoring to ensure he does not divulge Foundation secrets.

In the event that SCP-7922 retires or resigns from his position, he is to be debriefed and must sign a non-disclosure agreement before being allowed to leave the facility. Any attempt to disclose Foundation secrets will result in immediate re-containment.
