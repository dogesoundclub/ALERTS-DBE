Item #: SCP-984

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-984 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Personnel are to avoid engaging SCP-984 in conversation beyond what is necessary for maintenance and care. During any procedures or examinations, SCP-984 must wear a protective gas mask to prevent unintentional emotional manipulation.

Description: SCP-984 is a human male with noticeable facial features including a dark birthmark near the left corner of his mouth and a distinctive smile. SCP-984 wears a bucket hat, gold earring on the left ear, and a red scarf. Of note are SCP-984's VR Jade LED eyes, which glow brightly when SCP-984 experiences strong emotions.

SCP-984 has a unique talent for working with animals, which led to their former profession as a veterinarian. SCP-984 is manipulative and is known to have used their ability to emotionally connect with animals to their advantage in past situations. Personnel should be wary when interacting with SCP-984 as they have a strong sense of independence and are resistant to authority or rules they see as unnecessary. SCP-984 has been known to exhibit rebellious behavior, such as leaving the office early or taking unauthorized time off.

Addendum: After an incident involving SCP-984's emotional manipulation of a member of personnel, it was decided that SCP-984 must always wear a protective gas mask. SCP-984 has shown an unwillingness to comply with regulations regarding the mask but has not attempted to remove it during observations.
