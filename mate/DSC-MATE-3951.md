DSC identification number 3951 is an enigmatic electrician of the tiger species. With a ferocious appearance, this male feline stands out from the rest with his piercing VR Rainbow LED eyes and a blue bandana wrapped tightly around his head.

His red cross earring, combined with a medical mask covering his mouth, adds a touch of mystery to his overall persona.

This unique trait often amuses his comrades, who witness his tendency to take charge in group events and delegate tasks with a matter-of-fact attitude.

DSC 3951 may seem like a passive observer at first, but his organizational skills coupled with his distinct appearance make him a force to be reckoned with in the world of urban fantasy.
