Item #: SCP-1472

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1472 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Access to SCP-1472 is granted only by Level 2 personnel or above. SCP-1472 is to be provided with a computer and internet access for routine programming work, but any internet activity must be monitored for potential breaches in security protocols.

Description: SCP-1472 appears to be a human male, identified as a programmer with no known anomalous abilities. They show no overt signs of physical or psychological deviation from typical human behavior. However, upon closer inspection, SCP-1472's face is covered in orange stripes, and they wear a green cross earring in one ear. They display a persistent desire to wear a medical mask over their mouth, which they claim is for personal protection. Additionally, SCP-1472 dons a red scarf as an accessory which they often adjust as a fidgeting habit.

SCP-1472's most significant anomaly is their personality. They exhibit increased levels of reliability and organization, but they often become unusually inflexible when faced with unexpected situations, and they are not typically receptive to new ideas. These tendencies can lead to humorously awkward social interactions.

SCP-1472's programming skills are highly valued by the Foundation, and they are never reluctant to work. However, due to their attitude towards change, they can become difficult to work with when confronted with new instructions or protocols. Any changes in their assigned tasks require prior warnings and extensive briefing to ensure a smooth transition.

Addendum: In recent interviews with SCP-1472, the subject has expressed a growing interest in the Foundation's research and containment work. Surveillance must be increased to ensure SCP-1472 does not attempt to access restricted information that could endanger the Foundation's mission.
