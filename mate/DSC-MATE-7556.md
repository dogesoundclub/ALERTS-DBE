Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7556, codenamed "Delivery Driver", is to be monitored through regular check-ins and occasional site visits. Any significant deviations or changes in behavior must be documented and reported immediately.

Description: 7556 is a human male with the distinct feature of ski goggles for eyes, and a police cap for his head. The subject's mouth is always concealed by a medical mask, making communication challenging at times. Despite this, 7556 is a delivery driver by profession, and his services are highly sought after for their unparalleled efficiency.

However, 7556's absent-mindedness presents a significant challenge to his work. The subject often loses track of time and forgets important appointments, leading to humorous but annoying situations. This forgetfulness can be attributed to the subject's tendency to get lost in thought, making it challenging to focus on the task at hand.

Despite these quirks, 7556 remains a stable and reliable asset to the foundation's urban operations. The subject's deliveries remain prompt and precise, with utmost discretion for the contents of the package. 7556 is still under observation, but there are currently no significant threats to containment.
