Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6621 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-███. DSC-MATE-6621 is permitted to perform its job as a beautician on staff members, but must be monitored during gift-giving holidays to prevent any anomalous activity.

Description: DSC-MATE-6621 is a male human with blonde hair, normal glasses, and a distinctive mouth spot. DSC-MATE-6621 has an additional mouth feature, which appears to be a frightened or anxious expression that is always present, even when DSC-MATE-6621 is smiling. DSC-MATE-6621 also has a green cross earring on one ear and is often seen wearing a silver chain and carrying a candy stick.

However, DSC-MATE-6621's perfectionism can lead to obsessive and potentially harmful behavior during gift-giving occasions.

DSC-MATE-6621 has shown no signs of aggressive behavior towards staff or outside individuals and has cooperated fully with Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-6621 is aware of its anomalous properties and has agreed to comply with all containment procedures.
