Item #: 7601

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As of this date, 7601 is not contained due to their high profile within the political sphere. However, Foundation agents are to observe and document any abnormal activity or behavior.

Description: 7601 is a Caucasian male human with noticeable spots on their face. Their eyes take the shape of ski goggles, standing out in stark contrast to their hoodie-clad head. 7601 is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette, adding to their ominous aura. 

While their appearance is unsettling in some aspects, it is their personality that poses the greatest risk. They are often lost in thought or immersed in their work, leading to a forgetful and absent-minded nature that can have disastrous consequences. It is not unheard of for them to miss vital appointments or neglect critical events because of their ongoing projects.

The Foundation has reason to believe that 7601's forgetfulness is not entirely natural. Our agents have gathered evidence that suggests they are intentionally forgetful to cover harmful activities connected to their political reach. We urge all Foundation operatives to remain alert to the possibility of harm caused by 7601's forgetfulness.

Addendum: 7601's activities have become increasingly erratic, coupled with a sharp increase in absent-mindedness. Foundation agents are to increase surveillance and monitoring of 7601. Any further evidence supporting the possibility of anomalous activity must be reported immediately.
