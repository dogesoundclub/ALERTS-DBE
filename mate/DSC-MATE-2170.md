Item #: 2170

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2170 is to be kept isolated from all members of the public at all times. Due to its unexpected and sometimes hazardous behavior, Item 2170's containment is to be heavily monitored by designated personnel. In the event of a breach, the foundation must deploy and employ all available resources in order to re-contain the volatile Item 2170. 

Description: Item 2170 is a male humanoid that seems to be dressed in theatrical clothing similar to that of a theater manager's outfit. His skin has a pink hue and his eyes resemble those of a clown, emitting a red glow. Item 2170 also wears a gold earring on one ear and a red scarf around his neck. However, the most notable feature of Item 2170's appearance is the LED gas mask he wears over his face, which lights up various colors.

Personality: Item 2170 tends to be deeply introspective, frequently losing himself in thought for prolonged periods. At times, he can become so preoccupied with his own ideas and musings that he completely overlooks his surroundings, resulting in comical instances of stumbling or walking into objects. Despite these quirks, Item 2170 is capable of communicating rationally and intelligibly, making it a force to be reckoned with if managed correctly.

Addendum: Item 2170 has demonstrated unusual physical abilities, including extreme agility and heightened strength, making it a formidable entity to contain. As of this moment, a full evaluation of his capabilities is under way. Availability of staff and support personnel for re-containment efforts must be kept at the ready for any occasion.
