Item #: 6532

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6532 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit fitted with specialized equipment to simulate a natural jungle environment. The containment staff is advised to refrain from any interaction with the subject as it may become attached to them, potentially leading to detrimental consequences. All personal belongings of the subject must be inspected and secured before entering the containment area to avoid any potential anomalies. 

Description: Subject 6532, otherwise known as the Car Salesman, is a male monkey of an unidentified species. The subject exhibits a distinctively caring and nurturing behavior that tends to extend towards inanimate objects as well. Its behavior can be described as borderline anthropomorphization of its possessions, including its car, plants, and even household appliances. 

Subject 6532's physical appearance is relatively unremarkable, with black hair and jade earing. Its eyes are still undetermined as it tends to remain concealing its eyes. Its ability to communicate verbally has yet to be determined due to its preference for monkey-like sounds. 

Personality:   Subject 6532's nurturing behavior is to be considered a double-edged sword. While it is merely an endearing trait in most circumstances, with the subject's ability to perceive inanimate objects as animated beings, it can potentially become a severe security risk. It is unknown and possible that subject 6532 will attempt to free plot any possessions of their containment staff. 

Addendum: Due to sightings of Subject 6532's exhibiting anomalous behavior in nature, research teams are investigating the origin of the subject's species. Progress has steadily been made on determining his species. However, due to unsuccessful results, subject 6532 remains an anomaly in Foundation custody.
