Item #: SCP-7257

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7257 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. No interaction with SCP-7257 is to occur without the supervision of at least one Level 2 personnel. As SCP-7257 appears to be sentient and capable of interacting with humans, caution should be taken to ensure the mental stability of SCP-7257, as well as the individuals interacting with it.

SCP-7257 is currently employed as a mechanic at a local garage in ████████. SCP Foundation personnel are to observe SCP-7257's work hours and secretly monitor its behavior, ensuring no anomalous activities are taking place.

Description: SCP-7257 is a human male, approximately 1.80 meters in height and 78 kilograms in weight. SCP-7257 has orange stripes on its face and a constant smile, with glasses commonly associated with a "nerdy" appearance. SCP-7257 wears a blue bandana on its head and a green cross earring on its left ear. SCP-7257 is frequently seen wearing a gold chain around its neck and an LED gas mask covering its mouth and nose.

SCP-7257 displays a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. It is capable of telling funny stories and performing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. SCP-7257 is also shown to have a high level of technical proficiency in the field of mechanics, constantly tinkering with various devices in its possession.

SCP-7257's gas mask appears to be non-anomalous and is used by SCP-7257 to protect its respiratory system from various environmental hazards. However, it is unknown why SCP-7257 wears it at all times and refuses to remove it during interactions with Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-7257 has expressed interest in creating mechanized devices which would aid in the containment of other SCP objects. These ideas have been denied by Foundation personnel, as SCP-7257's tendencies towards humor and unpredictability are deemed too high-risk to incorporate into Foundation containment methods.
