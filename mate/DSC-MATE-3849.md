Item #: DSC-MATE-3849

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3849 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber designed for humanoid creatures. Any personnel assigned to work with DSC-MATE-3849 must be trained in handling and understanding rabbit behavior. DSC-MATE-3849 is allowed access to various fabrics and materials for the purpose of designing and creating fashion items, but any finished products must be inspected by a designated researcher before release.

Description: DSC-MATE-3849 appears to be a male rabbit with VR jade LED eyes and a gold earring in one ear. Its most notable feature is a perpetually frightened mouth that is shaped like an 'O'. When not engaged in fashion design, DSC-MATE-3849 often engages in playful banter and attempts to tell jokes, though it rarely succeeds in making others laugh. 

DSC-MATE-3849 is an accomplished fashion designer and often incorporates unusual materials and shapes into its creations. These items are popular in high fashion circles, though many people are unaware of DSC-MATE-3849's true nature. When not designing, DSC-MATE-3849 values harmony and social connections, seeking to establish friendships with others, but often becoming anxious or frightened when under pressure or in stressful situations.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3849 has displayed a number of anomalous properties. When presented with a piece of fabric or material, it will often instantly know how to turn it into a fashionable garment or accessory. It is also capable of using its gold earring to communicate with other rabbits in the vicinity, suggesting a higher level of communication ability than typical for its species. Further testing of DSC-MATE-3849's abilities is ongoing.
