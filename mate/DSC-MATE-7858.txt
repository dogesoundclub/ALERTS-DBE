Item #: SCP-7858

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7858 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-7858 is to be granted only to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and all interactions are to be monitored and recorded.

Due to SCP-7858's high risk for impulsive and unpredictable behavior, all communication with SCP-7858 is to be conducted remotely via intercom or video feeds. In case of a containment breach, all personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and wait for a specialized containment team to handle the situation.

Description: SCP-7858 is a female human with distinctive orange stripes on their face as well as a permanent smile. SCP-7858's eyes are blue clown eyes, which are unnaturally large and often make prolonged eye contact with those they interact with. SCP-7858 also wears a tiara and gold earrings as part of their appearance.

SCP-7858's most unique features are their silver chain and LED gas mask. The silver chain is a form of control mechanism, as it is used to immobilize SCP-7858 in emergency situations. The LED gas mask is a device that SCP-7858 uses to breathe, which also enhances their vision and allows for more precise targeting.

SCP-7858's personality is highly impulsive, with a tendency to act on their emotions rather than thinking things through. However, SCP-7858 is also highly intelligent and strategic, often making surprising or amusing decisions that catch others off guard.

Despite SCP-7858's unpredictable and often dangerous behavior, they have managed to become the leader of a powerful mafia organization. It is suspected that SCP-7858's anomalous abilities played a significant role in their rise to power, but further investigation is required to confirm this theory.

Addendum: Due to SCP-7858's connections to organized crime, all information regarding their past is highly confidential and is only accessible with Level 4 clearance or higher. Any attempt to investigate SCP-7858's background without proper clearance will result in immediate disciplinary action.
