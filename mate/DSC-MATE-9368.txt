SCP-9368, also known as "The Legal Clown," is a human female who works as a lawyer in the city's court system. Her most notable features include her spotted face and a grin that never seems to leave her lips. Her blue clown-like eyes stare out from her green, tight-curled head, which is adorned with a two-color band across her forehead. 

SCP-9368 typically wears a black choker around her neck and is often seen with a lit cigarette in hand. Don't be fooled by her playful demeanor; The Legal Clown is remarkably analytical and logical, and has a talent for arguing with others, even if it's just for fun. Her casual and humorous approach to everyday conversation often leads others to underestimate her capabilities within the courtroom.

However, her unique blend of intelligence and approachability make her a valuable asset in her field. With SCP-9368 on the case, the outcome is almost always in her client's favor. Nevertheless, it is recommended to approach with caution, as her playful tendencies can often mask a more calculating and manipulative nature.
