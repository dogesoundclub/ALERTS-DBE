Item #: SCP-8228

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8228 is to be monitored during their work as a train driver to ensure they do not exhibit any anomalous behavior. Any deviations from standard operating procedures are to be immediately reported to Site Director. SCP-8228 is to be allowed contact with family members and friends as long as they are cleared by Foundation agents.

Description: SCP-8228 is a female human train driver with a dry sense of humor. They are known for their purple lipstick and jade earrings. Their eyebrows are an orange color, and they have a dual-colored band on their forehead. SCP-8228 often wears a medical mask while driving trains. They also have a silver chain accessory around their neck.

SCP-8228 carries out their job with diligence, but their wit often catches passengers off guard. SCP-8228 emits an anomalous energy that is yet to be fully understood. During interviews, SCP-8228 has shown no awareness of their abilities. However, in a controlled setting, SCP-8228 has been shown to produce a force that can knock objects out of place.

SCP-8228's family and friends describe them as an introverted individual, often keeping to themselves. SCP-8228's anomalous properties have yet to show any adverse effects on those close to them.

Addendum: Site-15 will continue to monitor SCP-8228's behavior and abilities. Further testing is currently suspended, pending review by the Ethics Committee.
