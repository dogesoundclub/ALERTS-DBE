Item #: DSC-MATE-6348

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6348 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, and all personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-6348 must wear safety glasses, due to the anomalous properties of her red clown eyes. No mirrors are to be present in DSC-MATE-6348's chamber, to prevent any harm or accidental activation of her abilities.

Description: DSC-MATE-6348 is a female doctor of human origin, with orange hair, and red cross earrings on both ears. What distinguishes DSC-MATE-6348 from other humans is her anomalous appearance, manifested by her red clown eyes, which have the ability to hypnotize those who look into them. DSC-MATE-6348 has a reckless personality trait, which makes it difficult for her to think through situations, causing minor accidents and mishaps.

DSC-MATE-6348 has a secondary anomalous effect, wherein she can polymorphically change any non-living, non-magical object she touches. The object shifts in appearance and properties, resembling and functioning as something else entirely. DSC-MATE-6348 has demonstrated a high aptitude for her ability, although the exact breadth of her polymorphic range is unknown.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6348 was recovered by Foundation agents after several people reported seeing a clown who was able to change objects into other things. Upon investigation, the Foundation was able to secure DSC-MATE-6348, and her abilities were contained. DSC-MATE-6348 has since become a useful asset as a medical officer, although her erratic behavior constantly poses a potential safety risk.
