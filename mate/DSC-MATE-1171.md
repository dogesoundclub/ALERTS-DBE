Item #: 1171

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1171 is to be confined to a standard-issue humanoid containment cell at all times. The door is to be double-locked and reinforced with steel plating to prevent escape. The subject is permitted one hour of monitored exercise per day, and provided with a standard diet for a creature of their size and needs. Any requests for additional items or privileges must be approved by at least two Level-3 personnel.

Description: Subject 1171 is a large, male Bengal tiger in the form of an electrician. They stand at approximately 6'5" tall and display striking red clown eyes, indicating some form of mutation or magical influence. Their head is covered by a peculiar bucket hat and sports a gold earring in its right ear. They wear a medical mask over their mouth, but in rare cases, they have been observed displaying a frightened mouth to others. A silver chain can also be seen hanging around their neck.

Personality: 1171 generally displays a friendly and curious attitude towards authorized personnel but, under threat, can immediately become aggressive. They are incredibly intelligent, displaying a sharp wit and a love for argumentation and debate, often engaging in playful and humorous arguments with their captors. Despite their charismatic pastime, they are not to be underestimated, as they possess acute reflexes and lightning-fast movement, capable of disarming or even killing a person with a single swipe of their claws.

Since containment, 1171 has been compliant as long as their conditions are met. During their time in captivity, researchers have noted discrepancies between their behavior patterns and traditional tiger instincts, leading some to speculate about additional anomalous features being at play beyond their morphic state. They remain under constant observation and research by Level-3 personnel to determine the extent of their abilities and optimize their containment procedures.
