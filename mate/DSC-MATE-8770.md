Item #: DSC-MATE-8770

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8770 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All subjects interacting with DSC-MATE-8770 must wear Level 2 biohazard protection suits, as DSC-MATE-8770 is responsible for the production of an anomalous substance. Any samples of this substance must be immediately analyzed and cataloged.

Description: DSC-MATE-8770 appears to be a female human with orange stripes on their face and purple lips. Their glasses are of the normal variety, but they have green cross earrings and wear a medical mask. Their hair is styled in pig tails, and they sport a two-color band on their forehead. An item identified as a silver chain is also present on their person.

DSC-MATE-8770's unique ability is its production of a substance of unknown composition, emitted from their mouth behind the medical mask. This substance is capable of anomalous feats, including the stabilization of temporal anomalies and the neutralization of eldritch energies. Additionally, when ingested, the substance appears to have a psychoactive effect on the consumer, leading to elevated creativity and insight.

DSC-MATE-8770 displays a highly analytical and logical personality, frequently making dry, witty observations in a deadpan fashion. They are not easily swayed by emotions and can maintain calm in high-pressure scenarios.

Further research is necessary to determine the cause and extent of these anomalous properties. Interviews with DSC-MATE-8770 have not yielded any significant information.
