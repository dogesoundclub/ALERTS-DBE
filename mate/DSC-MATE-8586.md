Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 8586, known to the public as a traffic officer, must be monitored at all times while on duty. The subject is allowed to interact with civilians, but under no circumstances are they to use their charismatic abilities to gather sensitive information or manipulate those around them for their personal gain.

Description: Subject 8586 is a human female with striking physical features. She has bright orange stripes on her cheeks, which stand out against her pale skin. Her lips are painted a deep red, drawing in unwanted attention from admirers. The most unnerving aspect of her appearance is her blue clown eyes, which seem to shift in color and size depending on her mood. She also wears a green cross earring on her left ear and a silver chain around her neck.

Subject 8586's personality is magnetic, and she is easily able to connect with others on a deep level. Her charisma and charm often disarm even the most guarded individuals, allowing her to extract information that others couldn't. There have been reports of her using her abilities to get confessions out of criminals and even garnering classified information from government officials.

However, her charming nature can also lead to unprofessional behavior, such as getting strangers to open up about their life stories or sharing inappropriate anecdotes that bring people closer together. She may come off as unprofessional, but it seems to be a coping mechanism for the burden of her abilities.

In conclusion, subject 8586 must be kept under strict supervision to prevent the inappropriate use of their abilities. Any reports of 8586 gathering sensitive information or manipulating civilians must be reported immediately to Foundation personnel.
