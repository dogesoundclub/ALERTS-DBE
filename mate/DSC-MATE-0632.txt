Addendum 632-1: Incident Report

On ██/██/████, SCP-632 experienced a severe episode of mania, resulting in significant property damage and the injury of several staff members. SCP-632's clothing designs became increasingly unstable, causing objects and individuals to become fused together or to mutate into grotesque forms.

After a prolonged struggle, SCP-632 was subdued and contained. It has been determined that SCP-632 requires specialized mental health treatment, in addition to the containment measures already in place. Further investigation into SCP-632's anomalous abilities is ongoing.
