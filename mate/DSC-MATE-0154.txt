SCP-154 is a humanoid tiger with striking red clown eyes and a distinct blue bandana atop its head. Sporting a red cross earring, SCP-154 is often found wielding a candy stick, which serves as its signature accessory. Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-154 is a highly empathetic creature, attuned to the emotions of those around it. This makes it an excellent traffic officer, able to diffuse high-tension situations with a kind word or a well-timed joke. However, such intense emotional awareness can also have a humorous side effect, leading to SCP-154 being able to bring joy to even the bleakest of circumstances. Nevertheless, as with all anomalies, personnel are advised to approach SCP-154 with caution and respect.
