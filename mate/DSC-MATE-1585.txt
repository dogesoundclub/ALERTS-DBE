Item Number: 1585
Classification: Humanoid
Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1585 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with additional restrictions on his access to animals. Any animals brought in for examination by 1585 are to be screened and quarantined if necessary before being allowed near him.

Description: Subject 1585 is a male humanoid of average build and height. He sports thick orange stripes across his face and a permanent wide smile. His eyes are covered by ski goggle lenses, and he often wears a bucket hat on his head. At all times, a gold earring adorns his left ear and a red scarf is worn around his neck, which often changes characters in winters, latest it is Jack Skeleton face.

Personality: Known for his rebellious nature, subject 1585 enjoys pushing boundaries and finding ways to bend rules in humorous ways. He retains this attitude in his work as a veterinarian, often breaking protocols just to see what would happen, but he knows better than to put the animals at risk. However, due to his curious and adventurous nature, great caution is advised when handling animals around him.

Addendum: Following a recent incident in which subject 1585 attempted to talk to a group of primates on his own, all interactions with potentially dangerous animals must be strictly supervised; any deviation from such protocol will result in disciplinary measures.
