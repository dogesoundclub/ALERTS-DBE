Item #: 3806

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 3806 is to be located at Fire Station 9 and is to report for duty every 24 hours. 3806 is not to be allowed to leave the station unless a suitable emergency has arisen. In the event of an emergency, 3806 is to be dispatched as part of a firefighting team with a minimum of 4 other people. During downtime, 3806 is to be monitored closely for any unusual behavior.

Description: 3806 is a human male, roughly 6 foot tall, and of average build. There is no obvious sign of abnormality, except for the fact that the subject has red clown eyes that emit a strange glow in the dark. The subject typically wears a purple cap with a headset and a two-color band on his forehead. He is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck.

Personality: 3806 is a reliable and organized individual with a stubborn streak. The subject has a hard time adapting to new situations, which can cause some humorous situations when unexpected changes occur. The subject can be quite assertive at times and tends to take charge of situations, whether he's supposed to or not.

Addendum: 3806 has been observed displaying increased strength and speed during emergency situations. This, combined with his red clown eyes, has resulted in some speculation that the subject may possess anomalous abilities. Further testing is necessary to confirm or deny this possibility.
