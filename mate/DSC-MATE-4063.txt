Item #: SCP-4063

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-4063 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Personnel are reminded to treat SCP-4063 with respect and understanding due to her empathetic abilities. SCP-4063's real estate license has been revoked, and she is not to be permitted contact with any potential victims. Personnel are to monitor SCP-4063's emotional state and report any unusual changes to the medical staff.

Description:
SCP-4063 is a female human with the following physical attributes: spots on her face, purple lips, orange eyebrows, blonde hair with a wing, a silver chain and jade earring, and a pair of goggles on her forehead. Her most striking feature is the two-color band across her forehead. SCP-4063 displays a deep empathy and understanding for others, often to the point of experiencing emotional outbursts or crying when confronted with someone's pain or suffering. SCP-4063 has shown a fondness for animals and nature.

Addendum:
SCP-4063 was first contained after the Foundation received reports of her manipulating potential home buyers into purchasing "haunted" properties. After interviewing several affected individuals, it was discovered that SCP-4063 had been using her empathic abilities to sense the biographies of former homeowners and craft convincing stories about their "unfinished business." SCP-4063 has expressed regret for her actions and shows a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel.
