Description: SCP-9095 is a female human with an unusual physical appearance. SCP-9095's face features a consistent smile, even in neutral expressions, and wears normal glasses.

SCP-9095 exhibits a highly organized and calculated personality, preferring to plan ahead for any contingencies. Despite their efforts to plan ahead, SCP-9095 possesses an impulsive side that can manifest as spontaneous adventures and last-minute party planning.

SCP-9095's anomalous properties have not been fully determined, but it is believed that their appearance and behavior are associated with eldritch entities. SCP-9095's presence may attract other beings from elsewhere, making them a potential subject for containment breaches, and suggesting a possible cause for SCP-9095's spontaneous behavior.

SCP-9095 was discovered working as a Security Guard at [REDACTED]. Efforts to remove SCP-9095 from their occupation were met with resistance, as SCP-9095's presence was found to greatly improve overall morale and productivity amongst their colleagues.

Addendum: Despite SCP-9095's seemingly playful demeanor, they have been involved in several containment breaches, and thus must be kept under constant observation. Any attempts by SCP-9095 to behave inappropriately will be met with disciplinary action.
