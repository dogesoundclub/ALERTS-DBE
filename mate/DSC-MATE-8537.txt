SCP-8537, also known as "The Traffic Officer," is a humanoid anomaly that works as a law enforcement officer in urban areas. SCP-8537 exhibits a unique appearance, featuring bright red lips and red clown-like eyes that contrast with the neutral medical mask covering its mouth. The entity's forehead features a pair of goggles and green cross earrings on its ears. 

While SCP-8537 appears to be human, its ability to make impulsive decisions and engage in risky behavior is unlike any human observed before. The entity's recklessness often leads to comical scenarios, such as car crashes or other accidents that occur while showing off. 

SCP-8537 has been classified as safe and allowed to continue its work as a traffic officer, as its anomalous abilities do not pose a significant threat to human life. However, due to its unique appearance and behavior, the Foundation has taken measures to keep SCP-8537 under close observation at all times.
