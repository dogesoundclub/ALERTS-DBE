Description: SCP-4324 is a male human electrician, exhibiting several unusual physical characteristics. SCP-4324's face features a series of spots which have yet to be identified as any known medical condition. SCP-4324 also wears nerd glasses over his eyes, with a red scarf and police cap on his head. A pair of goggles is situated on his forehead at all times, with an LED gas mask as his primary accessory.

Despite his profession, SCP-4324 has a tendency to be forgetful and easily sidetracked. Certain situations will trigger humorous lapses in memory, such as forgotten appointments or getting lost in unfamiliar areas. SCP-4324 should be actively monitored due to his condition.

Addendum: SCP-4324's appearance may appear harmless, but we must not underestimate his capabilities. His work as an electrician places him in a unique position to access sensitive areas and equipment.
