Item #: 4294

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-4294 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to basic necessities, under constant surveillance of the security personnel. Feeding and grooming will be carried out using approved primates handling techniques by the authorized personnel only. Any unauthorized contact with SCP-4294 is strictly prohibited.

Description:
SCP-4294 is a male monkey, species still not classified, standing at a height of 60 cm and weighing approximately 15 kgs. The subject has a silver chain around its neck, which is non-anomalous but appears to be a treasured accessory of SCP-4294. Another interesting feature of SCP-4294 is its possession of a candy stick, which it uses as a tool to interact with the environment.

SCP-4294 displays a caring and nurturing personality, which is highly unusual for primate species. SCP-4294 tends to take care of its friends and family members as if they were its own offspring, leading to comical situations of treating humans as baby primates. These behaviors are observable even in the containment chamber, where SCP-4294 plays with and grooms itself continuously.

SCP-4294 was found during a government facility raid in 20██ in ████████, India, where it was being used as a security guard by the facility staff, raising several ethical questions concerning animal rights. SCP-4294 apparently bonded with its human captors and refused to leave the facility, leading to its discovery by the Foundation operatives.

Addendum:
SCP-4294's highly developed nurturing behavior might be an indication of its anomalous properties. The research team has been directed to investigate further and gather additional information.
