Description: DSC-MATE-6011 appears the same as an average brown rabbit, with the exception of its clown-like red eyes that give off a feeling of intense discomfort. Its mouth is always in a frightened position, further adding to its unsettling appearance.

It wears a red scarf and carries a whistle that it uses to alert its keepers if it feels uncomfortable or scared.
