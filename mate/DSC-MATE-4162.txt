Access to the subject's containment area requires Level 2 clearance or higher, and all entry and exit points must be monitored by surveillance cameras at all times. Subject 4162 is to be given access to a fully functional on-site electrical workshop to prevent any outbursts or aberrant behavior. Personnel assigned to Subject 4162 must have a solid understanding of electrical engineering and be trained in utilizing all appropriate safeguards and emergency protocols.

Description: Subject 4162 is a male human of average height and weight, wearing a hoodie and gold chain, and sporting normal glasses and a medical mask that obscures the lower half of his face. The subject claims to be a certified electrician, and his expertise in electrical engineering is demonstrated through his uncanny ability to detect electrical malfunctions and repair them with ease.

Personality-wise, Subject 4162 is impulsive and prone to acting on his emotions, often making rash decisions without fully considering the consequences. As a result, he can be unpredictable and amusing at times, much to the surprise of his colleagues and acquaintances.
