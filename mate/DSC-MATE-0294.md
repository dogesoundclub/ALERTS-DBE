Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 294 is to be monitored and kept under surveillance at all times.

Description: Subject 294 appears to be a human male in his late 30s with a unique appearance. His face is covered in spots, and his mouth appears to be permanently frozen into a frightened expression. His eyes are blue clown eyes, which are always dilated and appear to be fixed on an imaginary object. His head is often covered with a hoodie, and he wears a red victory band on his forehead.

Subject 294 wears a red scarf, which he reportedly received as a gift from a close friend. He is often seen smoking cigarettes, which he claims help him stay calm in stressful situations.

Despite his unusual appearance, Subject 294 is outgoing and sociable. He enjoys being the center of attention and often tells humorous stories or jokes. His humor can be contagious and has been known to cause uncontrollable laughter in those around him.

It should be noted that Subject 294 has demonstrated a tendency towards erratic behavior and outbursts of anger, particularly when his personal space is violated. It is suspected that there may be a connection between his unique appearance and his emotional stability, although this has not been confirmed.
