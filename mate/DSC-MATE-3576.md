Item #: 3576

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3576 is currently contained within a maximum security prison facility specifically designed for anomalous creatures. Any attempts to approach DSC-MATE-3576 outside of the designated security protocols are strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-3576 appears to be a rabbit of anomalous origin who has been identified as the head of a criminal organization commonly referred to as the "Warren Triad." DSC-MATE-3576's eyes are Jade LED and visibly process information at a rate far beyond that of non-anomalous creatures. DSC-MATE-3576's head is adorned with a blue bandana, and two accessories: a red scarf, and a candy stick.

DSC-MATE-3576 has exhibited a rebellious personality, taking joy in pushing the boundaries of what is typically expected of a crime boss. This trait has resulted in both humorous and potentially dangerous situations, such as intentionally breaking rules or finding ways to bend them. DSC-MATE-3576's cooperation with the Foundation was achieved through use of mutually beneficial means.

Addendum 01 - Incident 3576-A:
During a routine inspection of DSC-MATE-3576's cell, security personnel discovered a hidden compartment containing several weapons, explicit photographs, and a handwritten list of Foundation personnel. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-3576 was attempting to organize a prison break in which DSC-MATE-3576 and several other anomalous creatures would escape captivity. The breakout was ultimately prevented through Foundation countermeasures. DSC-MATE-3576 was disciplined accordingly and has since been placed under higher security protocols.
