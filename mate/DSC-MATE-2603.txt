Item #: SCP-2603

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2603 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All interactions must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Personnel are to wear gas masks while in SCP-2603's presence at all times. Any attempt by SCP-2603 to delegate tasks to personnel is to be met with polite deflection.

Description: SCP-2603 appears to be a normal human male of average height and build, except for the red clown eyes and spots on his face. SCP-2603 always wears a gas mask and a red scarf, along with a gold earring in one ear and a goggle on his forehead.

SCP-2603 exhibits an extremely organized and efficient personality, bordering on control-freak tendencies. This can lead to humorous situations, as SCP-2603 takes charge of group projects or events and delegates tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact manner. Despite this, SCP-2603 is not malicious and genuinely believes that his way of doing things is the most efficient.

It is unknown how or why SCP-2603 attained his anomalous properties, but it is believed to be related to an incident involving a gas mask and a clown costume. Further research is ongoing.

Addendum: SCP-2603 has been observed attempting to sell cars to personnel, claiming to have "the best deals on this side of reality". Personnel are reminded to not engage in any financial transactions with SCP-2603.
