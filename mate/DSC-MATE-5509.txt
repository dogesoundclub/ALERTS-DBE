Item #: 5509

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 
SCP-5509 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. It is to be provided with basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. However, any objects that can be perceived as gifts must not be brought within a ten-meter radius of SCP-5509's containment chamber. All testing and interaction with SCP-5509 must be approved by at least two Level-3 personnel.

Description:
SCP-5509 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. Its distinguishing features include a police cap on its head, horned rim glasses on its eyes, and a jade earring on its left ear. It often carries a red scarf around its neck and a lit cigarette in its right hand.

SCP-5509 displays a constant expression of fear on its face, with its mouth slightly open. It is also highly observant, with a keen attention to detail. SCP-5509's observational skills extend to its gift-giving abilities, which can be exceptional. However, SCP-5509 is known to become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift, often leading to extended periods of agonizing over its decision.

Addendum:
SCP-5509 was discovered after reports of a monkey breaking into a mall and raiding various stores for gifts for its friends and family. Foundation agents were able to locate SCP-5509 and bring it into containment before it could cause any harm to the public. SCP-5509 appears to have some ability to communicate in human language, although it has yet to be determined if it can understand spoken language as well. Further study is needed on SCP-5509's abilities and origin.
