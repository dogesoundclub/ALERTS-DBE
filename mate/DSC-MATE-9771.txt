Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9771 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with standard amenities.

Description: SCP-9771 is a female humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. Despite its human appearance, SCP-9771 possesses a number of abnormal physical features. SCP-9771 has spotted skin and red clown eyes, with a green head that has a curled edge. Two color bands are apparent on SCP-9771's forehead, and it wears goggles and a jade earring. SCP-9771 is often seen wearing a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-9771's personality is characterized by a heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli. SCP-9771 is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows and has a fondness for music and art that evokes strong feelings. SCP-9771 has shown no aggressive or violent tendencies, but its emotional state can be easily disrupted, leading to potential containment breaches if not handled with care.

SCP-9771's job is that of a car salesman, which it performs with efficiency and enthusiasm. Its salesmanship tactics have been noted to involve a strong emotional appeal to potential buyers, which can result in the sale of vehicles that would otherwise not be purchased.

SCP-9771 was discovered by Foundation agents after reports of a human with abnormal physical features and emotional sensitivity surfaced in an urban area. SCP-9771 was relocated to the Foundation's containment facility for study and safekeeping.

Addendum: SCP-9771 has expressed a desire to pursue a career in music or art. This request is currently under review by Foundation personnel.
