Item #: 4460

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4460 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with ample space and provisions for enrichment. Any requests for tools or materials must be vetted by no less than three senior staff members, and any repairs or modifications must be performed directly with 4460's consent and oversight.

Description: 4460 appears to be a male monkey of indeterminate species, with a penchant for practical problem-solving and a love of tinkering. Their eyes are uncharacteristic of their species and appear to be ski goggles, which obstruct any view of their actual eyes. Their head is covered by a purple baseball cap adorned with a headset, and a goggle rests just above their forehead. One of their ears features a gold earring, while their neck is adorned with a silver chain. They also possess a whistle that they seem to use frequently during their daily activities.

4460 is an expert at fixing objects through unconventional means, often utilizing objects others would dismiss as useless. They have been known to repair machines using duct tape, paperclips, and other improvised objects with great speed and precision. Their unconventional repairs have proven to be surprisingly effective, leading researchers to believe that there is more to 4460's capabilities that have yet to be uncovered.

Personality: 4460 is friendly and cooperative with staff but is quick to identify any weaknesses in a system or process. They have a unique perspective on the problems presented to them, and their solution, no matter how unorthodox, often proves to be invaluable. While cooperative, 4460 has no qualms about expressing frustration with staff who fail to see the merits in their work. 

It is also worth noting that 4460 has a mischievous streak and has been known to use their skills to prank staff and fellow containment subjects alike. However, these actions are not seen as malicious and are generally taken in good humor. 

Addendum: Research into 4460's capabilities is ongoing, and their potential uses in improving Foundation equipment and technology are being explored. However, due to their unconventional methods and personality, it is recommended that the staff exercise caution and discretion when working with 4460.
