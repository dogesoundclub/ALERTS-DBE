Item #: 5194

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5194 is to be monitored at all times and held in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. Interaction with 5194 must occur through a speaker system, and visual contact should be avoided at all costs. Personnel who view 5194 directly must undergo psychological evaluation before returning to their duties.

Description: Subject 5194 appears to be a female human of average height and weight, with spotted skin and red clown eyes. They always wear a medical mask and a hoodie, and they accessorize with a choker. Their most notable feature is their red lips, which are unnaturally vivid.

Subject 5194 has displayed exceptional attention to detail and observation skills, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, their obsession with finding the "perfect" gift often leads to long periods of indecision and anxiety. They are particularly gifted in interpersonal relationships but can become increasingly possessive over individuals of interest, resulting in potential harm to the subject being "selected."

Other aspects of their personality are shrouded in mystery, as they are known to manipulate and deceive others. Personnel are advised to remain vigilant and cautious when interacting with subject 5194.

Addendum: Following Incident-5194-A, all new personnel must undergo mandatory SCP-5194-Sensitivity Training before being granted clearance to work at Site-██.

Note: This item is pending reclassification as Keter.
