Item #: SCP-2434

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2434 is to be allowed to continue with their job as a reporter, but all published works must first be approved by a Foundation censor to avoid any potential memetic hazards. SCP-2434 must also undergo regular psychological evaluations to monitor any possible negative effects from their obsession with knowledge and education.

Description: SCP-2434 is a male human, with distinctive orange stripes on their face. They often wear nerd glasses over their eyes, and their hair is parted pink. SCP-2434 can usually be found wearing a red scarf and carrying a candy stick with them at all times.

SCP-2434's defining characteristic is their unquenchable thirst for knowledge. They spend most of their time researching obscure topics and collecting educational materials. SCP-2434's passion for learning can manifest itself in a desire to share their newfound knowledge with others, which can often lead to awkward or uncomfortable situations.

Although there have been no known memetic hazards associated with SCP-2434's knowledge-seeking behavior, caution should still be exercised around them to avoid any perceived risks.

SCP-2434 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and has not shown any indication of posing a risk to themselves or others. However, their obsessive behavior is closely monitored to ensure that it does not interfere with their job or daily life. 

SCP-2434 is a prime example of the potential dangers of a thirst for knowledge and how it can lead to hazardous consequences.
