Item #: 9907

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9907 is to be monitored at all times within their place of employment as a veterinarian. Any unusual or anomalous behavior is to be reported immediately to Foundation personnel for further investigation.

Description: Subject 9907 is a male human of average height and build, with a distinctive spot on the left side of their mouth. The subject is often seen wearing a red beanie and a medical mask over their mouth, as well as a pair of ski goggles for unknown reasons. The subject also sports a prominent jade earring and a gold chain around their neck.

Despite their somewhat unusual appearance, Subject 9907 is generally regarded as friendly and approachable, with a strong focus on harmony and social connections. However, the subject also possesses a noticeable goofy streak, which can lead to them telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with others. It is unknown whether this behavior is a natural part of their personality or a result of an anomalous effect.

Subsequent psychological evaluations have revealed no signs of mental instability or other abnormalities, leading the Foundation to conclude that Subject 9907 is a harmless human with no danger to containment breach. However, due to the subject's anomalous appearance and behavior, it is recommended that all interactions with the subject be conducted with caution.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Subject 9907 was observed exhibiting anomalous behavior within their place of employment. Further investigation revealed the presence of an unknown anomalous artifact within the building, which was subsequently secured by Foundation personnel. Subject 9907 was administered amnestics and released without incident.
