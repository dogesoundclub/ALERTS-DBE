Item #: 8398

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 8398 is to be kept in a secure facility designed to accommodate dangerous wildlife. The subject is to be provided with adequate living conditions, including a spacious enclosure, appropriate food and water, and regular veterinary checkups. Interactions with researchers and staff members should be limited to essential personnel only, and must adhere to strict safety protocols.

Description: 
SCP-8398 is a male Bengal tiger who manifests several anomalous properties, including a distinctive facial expression marked by a frightened mouth. The subject's eyes are similar to ski goggles, which provide it with superior vision and the ability to detect infrared light. SCP-8398 wears a red beanie, which it refuses to take off, and a jade earring on one of its ears. Though the subject's appearance and behavior are generally that of a typical tiger, SCP-8398 displays an unusual personality trait: a fierce loyalty and protectiveness towards friends and family.

SCP-8398 has been trained as a beautician, and is able to perform various hair and makeup services. It has been noted by staff members that the subject has an excellent eye for detail, and takes great pride in its work. However, due to its potentially dangerous nature, the subject is not permitted to perform its services on humans or any living beings other than other SCPs.

Personnel interacting with SCP-8398 should proceed with caution. Though the subject appears mostly friendly, its protectiveness towards its loved ones has led to several incidents in which it has become aggressive towards those it perceives to be threatening them. Staff members are advised to treat SCP-8398 with respect and adhere to all safety protocols when in its presence.

Addendum:
SCP-8398 has formed a close bond with another SCP, Item #5621, a Siamese cat with anomalous properties. The two are often observed sleeping together and grooming each other, and have been known to give each other small gifts. Though the nature of their relationship is not fully understood, it is clear that they have a deep affection for one another. Any interactions between SCP-8398 and Item #5621 should be closely monitored to prevent potential breaches of containment.
