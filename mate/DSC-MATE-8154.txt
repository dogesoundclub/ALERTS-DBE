Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8154 is to be kept under 24-hour video surveillance at all times. Any tampering or attempts to remove SCP-8154 from its current location will result in immediate disciplinary action. SCP-8154 is to remain employed at [REDACTED] fast food restaurant, where he works the night shift. All requests for time off must be approved by a Level 3 Researcher.

Description: SCP-8154 is a human male with orange stripes on his face, likely a result of the use of a cosmetic application. His most distinctive feature is the LED gas mask he wears, which makes it impossible to identify his facial features. He has green hair under a purple cap and wears a gold chain around his neck. He also wears normal glasses.

SCP-8154 exhibits obsessive behavior when it comes to gift-giving. They are highly observant and attentive to details, which makes them an excellent gift-giver. However, they are often overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift, and may spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over what to get someone. This behavior has been noted by the Foundation and is being monitored.

SCP-8154 was discovered when several customers at the fast food restaurant in which he works reported unusual behavior, including feeling uncomfortable or uneasy when in close proximity to him. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate, and SCP-8154 was identified as the cause of the unusual behavior.

Addendum: SCP-8154 has never displayed any anomalous activity or abilities.
