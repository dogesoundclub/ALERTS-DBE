Item #: SCP-8327

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8327 is to be housed at Site-19 and kept under constant surveillance. Due to her political influence, any interaction with SCP-8327 must be approved by a Level 4 Researcher and must be accompanied by at least two armed guards. Under no circumstances is SCP-8327 allowed access to any form of artistic medium, including but not limited to, paints, canvases, pencils, or paper.

Description: SCP-8327 is a female humanoid with striking facial features. Her most notable characteristic is the orange stripes that adorn her face, which are believed to have been caused by an anomalous reaction to a cosmetic product. Additionally, she has orange eyebrows and is often seen wearing a medical mask to obscure her mouth. Despite her distinctive appearance, SCP-8327 has been able to maintain a high-profile political career, working as a legislator and holding influence over various governmental organizations.

SCP-8327 possesses an abnormal creative streak and a pronounced interest in various forms of art. Despite regulations prohibiting her from accessing any art supplies or media, SCP-8327 has shown a remarkable ability to manifest her artistic impulses through conversation and other forms of communication. Her creative tendencies may be linked to her headwear, which has been described as a rainbow festival.

SCP-8327's personality is multifaceted and somewhat mercurial, ranging from charming and affable to emotionally detached and indifferent. It is uncertain whether her political ambition or her artistic proclivities are her primary motivation. Regardless, her abilities and influence make her a dangerous anomaly that requires constant vigilance and monitoring. 

Addendum: Research has indicated that SCP-8327's jade earrings generate a low-level anomalous field that has an undetectable effect on those within a five-meter range. Further testing is required to understand the full extent of this effect.
