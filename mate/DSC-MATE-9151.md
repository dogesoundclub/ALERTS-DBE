Item #: 9151

Containment Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9151 is to be kept under constant surveillance, with any deviations from normal behavior to be immediately reported to the containment team. Any attempts to use their empathic abilities for manipulative purposes must be quickly identified and countered. Due to their status as a car salesman, they are to be provided with a vehicle for transport and regular check-ins with Foundation personnel, with all interactions to be recorded and monitored.

Description: Subject 9151 is a human female of average height and build, with notable features including spots on their skin, red clown eyes, and a goggle worn on their forehead. Their head is an unnatural blue color, leading researchers to believe that they may have been exposed to an anomalous substance or event. They often accessorize with a gold chain, which can sometimes be used as a focus for their empathy. 

Personality: Despite their unusual appearance, Subject 9151 is known for their remarkable ability to empathize with others. They are highly attuned to the emotions of those around them, often picking up on subtle cues that others miss. This can make them invaluable in situations that require a delicate touch, such as negotiations or de-escalation. However, their empathic abilities can also be a double-edged sword, leading them to become emotionally overwhelmed or manipulated by those with ill intentions. 

Addendum: Subject 9151 has shown a strong desire to use their abilities for good, and has requested permission to aid in Foundation operations. While this request must be carefully considered, it may be possible to utilize their unique skills in certain circumstances. Further research is required to fully understand the extent of their abilities and the potential risks involved.
