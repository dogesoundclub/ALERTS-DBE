SCP-9056, also known as "The Primate Beautician", is an anomalous monkey that works as a beautician in various salons across the city. Despite its appearance, SCP-9056 is highly skilled in hairstyling and makeup, and is sought after by many clients who are unaware of its anomalous properties.

SCP-9056 has a parted pink head and wears a gold earring in each of its ears. It is often seen wearing a red scarf, as well as carrying a whistle. How SCP-9056 obtained these items is unknown, but it is believed that they may have been obtained through anomalous means.

In terms of personality, SCP-9056 has a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Despite not considering itself to be the life of the party, it has the ability to deliver deadpan jokes that are surprisingly funny. This has made SCP-9056 a favorite among its clients, who often request its services specifically.

While SCP-9056 does not exhibit any overtly dangerous behavior, it is still considered an SCP due to its anomalous properties. It is unclear what exactly makes SCP-9056 an anomalous creature, but research is ongoing in an attempt to better understand its abilities.
