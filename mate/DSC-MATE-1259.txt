Item #: SCP-1259

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1259, also known as "The Tiger Farmer," is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-1259 is to be provided with appropriate animal feed as well as the freedom to tend to a small garden located within the containment chamber. Any deviations to SCP-1259's routine must be reported to the Site Director and approved by at least two Level-3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1259 is a sentient tiger that has taken the form of a human farmer, complete with a bucket hat and nerd glasses. The entity measures approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighs 135 kilograms. SCP-1259's most notable feature is the red victory band it wears around its forehead and the red cross earring on its left ear. It is often seen carrying a candy stick in its pocket.

SCP-1259 displays high levels of organizational skills and efficiency which can at times appear domineering, bordering on obsessive. It has been witnessed taking control of group projects and events, delegating appropriate tasks to its peers. SCP-1259's efforts in maintaining an organized environment have proved to be beneficial for its containment chamber's upkeep whilst also providing further insight into its behavior.

SCP-1259's physical traits, in comparison to other known tigers, appear to have no adverse effect on it and its cognitive abilities are unimpaired. SCP-1259 seems to prefer spending its time on agriculture, dedicating a considerable amount of time tending to the plants in its garden.

Addendum: SCP-1259's actions of order and efficiency should be monitored regularly to assure that SCP-1259 does not have intense behaviors. In addition, progress at the tiger's garden should be noted as an observation of personality progression.
