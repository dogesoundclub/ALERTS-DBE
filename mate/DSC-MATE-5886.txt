Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5886 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. He must be restrained at all times, as his enthusiasm and energy may cause him to become unpredictable and dangerous. Access to Subject 5886 is restricted to Level-3 personnel and above.

Description: Subject 5886 is a male human with orange-striped facial features and ski goggle eyes. He wears a purple cap with a headset and a medical mask to conceal his facial features. The subject also wears a silver chain as an accessory.

Subject 5886 works as a banker and is known for his incredible energy and enthusiasm. He has a tendency to get overly excited about things that others may not find as interesting, which can cause humorous situations. However, when Subject 5886 becomes excessively excited, he may become a danger to those around him.
