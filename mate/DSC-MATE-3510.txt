Item #: 3510

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3510, identified as a male tiger, must be kept under constant surveillance within a fashion design studio. Any unauthorized personnel who enter the premises must be escorted out immediately. Any interaction with 3510 must be approved by the Foundation's senior staff.

Description: 3510 appears to be a typical tiger, possessing distinctive blue clown eyes and a green, unarranged head. His left ear is adorned with a red cross earring while the right is without. The subjects' mouth is concealed by a medical mask, and he is known to be associated with a silver chain. Subject 3510, however, is an anomaly in that he has taken up the job of a fashion designer.

Personality: As a noted outlier among his species, 3510 is outgoing and social, often being the center of attention wherever he goes. He is known to tell humorous tales and jokes that can leave anyone present in hysterics. It is uncertain if 3510 is fully self-aware of how strange his presence is in the fashion industry, but his design skills are exceptional.

Notes: It is best for Foundation personnel to limit contact with subject 3510 to prevent any inadvertent collaboration. In the event of any violations of these containment procedures, the punishment for all involved parties will be severe.
