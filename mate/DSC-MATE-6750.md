Special Containment Procedures: As an ordinary human, 6750 requires no specific containment measures. However, due to their profession as a veterinarian, their workplace must be regularly monitored for any anomalous activity related to animals.

Description: 6750 is a male human with distinctive facial features that include a spotted pattern and a constant smile. They are often seen wearing nerdy glasses and a red scarf, which complement their green, unarranged hair and jade earring on their left ear.

Despite their friendly demeanor, 6750 possesses a peculiar personality that sets them apart from ordinary humans. They value social connections and are often seen engaging in playful banter with their friends and colleagues. However, they also have a goofy side that sometimes leads to humorous situations, such as telling jokes or making silly faces.

6750's abilities as a veterinarian are exceptional, with a particular affinity for dealing with animals that possess anomalous properties. Their ability to communicate with and understand these creatures has been invaluable in the Foundation's efforts to contain them.

Addendum: 6750 has expressed an interest in studying and learning more about anomalous creatures outside of their professional duties. Their enthusiasm and dedication to helping contain and understand anomalies make them a valuable asset to the Foundation.
