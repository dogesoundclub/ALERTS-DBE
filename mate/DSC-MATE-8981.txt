SCP Foundation Description:

Containment Procedures: SCP-8981 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any food given to SCP-8981 is to be monitored and approved by the designated on-duty researcher. SCP-8981 is not to be allowed access to any flammable materials without express permission from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-8981 is a male monkey of unknown origin, standing at 3 ft tall. SCP-8981's most notable features include a red beanie on its head, a pair of nerd glasses over its eyes, and a pair of goggles resting on its forehead. SCP-8981 also has a gold earring in its left ear and is often seen with a candy stick in its hand.

SCP-8981 exhibits a highly creative and curious personality, often coming up with unusual solutions to problems. Despite being a monkey, SCP-8981 is able to communicate fluently with researchers and has been noted to excel in critical thinking and problem-solving. SCP-8981's expertise in these areas led to its employment as a firefighter.

Addendum: SCP-8981 was brought to the attention of the Foundation when it was observed putting out a house fire in a highly unusual manner. SCP-8981 utilized nearby flammable objects to contain the blaze, then used a series of jumps and flips to extinguish the remaining flames. Foundation operatives were notified and SCP-8981 was contained for further study. SCP-8981's particular skill set has proven highly useful in containing and extinguishing SCP-related fires.
