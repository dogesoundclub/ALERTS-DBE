Description: DSC-MATE-6355 is a humanoid creature identified as a male politician. It has orange stripes on its face along with a wide smile that matches its red clown eyes.

DSC-MATE-6355's personality trait is that it tends to be very energetic and enthusiastic about things. It enjoys getting others excited about things, which can lead to some humorous situations when DSC-MATE-6355 gets overly excited about something that others do not find interesting. However, this personality trait has also been known to be dangerous as DSC-MATE-6355 can influence people's thoughts and behaviour towards its own interests.

DSC-MATE-6355's anomalous properties trigger when it is given access to any media outlets, such as the internet, television, or radio stations. Upon accessing any of these media outlets, DSC-MATE-6355's influence is amplified and can cause an uncontrollable wave of excitement and enthusiasm in the individuals exposed to its activities. The amplitude of DSC-MATE-6355's influence is inversely proportional to the distance between it and the affected individuals.

DSC-MATE-6355's origin is unknown, but it was first encountered during one of its political campaigns. It has since been contained by the DogeSoundClub to prevent any disruption to global peace and stability.
