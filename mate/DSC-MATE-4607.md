He is mostly identifiable by his signature "Mouth Spot" and "Frightened Mouth," which are a distinctive characteristic of the subject's visage. This seems to be a result of an acute Oropharyngeal dystonia that affects the subject's vocal cords. His eyes resemble ski goggles and his hair is parted in a "Pink" color. His ears are pierced and bear a "Jade Earring." The subject is typically sighted sporting a "Red Scarf," which covers his lower face.
