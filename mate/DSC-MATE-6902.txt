SCP-6902, also known as "The Empathetic Tiger", is a male tiger and a highly trained veterinarian responsible for the health and well-being of the creatures that fall under Foundation purview. He has been observed wearing a distinctive red scarf and carrying a candy stick at all times, identifying him as an SCP Foundation employee.

SCP-6902's most striking feature is the VR Rainbow LED eyes he manifests whenever he is scanning for signs of distress or discomfort in his patients. These eyes change color depending on the nature of the issue, ranging from warm oranges and yellows to cool blues and greens.

Despite his fearsome appearance, SCP-6902 has a gentle and empathetic disposition that endears him to both his fellow staff members and the creatures he cares for. He is highly attuned to the emotions of others, often sensing and sympathizing with their pain or distress.

This ability has also led to some humorous situations, such as when SCP-6902 knows just the right thing to say to lift the spirits of Foundation personnel or when he helps others see the humor in a difficult situation.

In short, SCP-6902 is a vital member of the SCP Foundation team, using his unique combination of strength and empathy to care for both his animal patients and his fellow human beings.
