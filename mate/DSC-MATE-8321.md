Item #: DSC-MATE-8321

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8321 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber located in Site-██. He is to be allowed contact with selected personnel only under supervision of at least one Level 2 personnel. Access to electronic devices or any kind of electrical components is strictly prohibited unless authorized by the Level 2 personnel. DSC-MATE-8321 is allowed to smoke inside his room but the lighter or the matches should be provided by Site personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-8321 is a human male of approximately 33 years of age. He presents orange stripes on his face, that seem to go in steady lines from his forehead to his chin. This is a permanent trait that seems to have been part of his face since birth. He has an overall friendly expression, mostly due to his smile that hardly ever leaves his face. DSC-MATE-8321's head is within the norms of human physiology, but for an unknown reason, his ears present with an uncommon item; a jade earring. When asked about it, DSC-MATE-8321 always maintains that it is an important family heirloom.

DSC-MATE-8321 is an electrician by profession and shows proficiency in the handling of all kinds of electric components, from simple household appliances to powerful industrial machines. He has demonstrated an incredible ability to understand the flow of energy within electrical systems, which he calls "the song of the electrons."

Although overall easy-going and friendly, DSC-MATE-8321 has a tendency to act recklessly without thinking things through thoroughly. This carelessness leads to minor accidents and mishaps, some of which can be humorous. DSC-MATE-8321 also shows a tendency to show-off and impress others, especially when it comes to his knowledge of electrical components. This behavior can lead to dangerous situations if not closely monitored. 

DSC-MATE-8321 is also noteworthy for his accessory of choice, a cigarette, which he smokes religiously. His enjoyment of it seems to be more emotional or psychological than physical, since he has demonstrated that he can go for extended periods without needing to smoke. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8321 has an unwitting and unintentional ability to influence machinery and electrical systems. After extensive testing, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-8321's mere presence within the vicinity of electrical devices can affect them in subtle ways. For example, a refrigerator might start working more efficiently or a light bulb may last longer. The effect is amplified when DSC-MATE-8321 actively interacts with the devices, such as directing or repairing them. Further study is needed to determine the specificity and limits of this ability.
