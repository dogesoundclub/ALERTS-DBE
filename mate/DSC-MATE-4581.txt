Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4581 is to be contained within a secure cell inside Site-███. Under no circumstances is SCP-4581 to be allowed access to any political power or influence. All communications received from SCP-4581 must be monitored and only approved personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-4581.

Description: SCP-4581 appears to be a human male of average build, standing at 6'2". Its face is distinguishable by orange stripes and a frightened mouth. SCP-4581 has jade LED eyes and wears a jade earring on its left ear. Its mouth is fully covered by a medical mask at all times.

SCP-4581 has displayed a rebellious personality, often pushing boundaries and breaking rules for the sake of amusement. This behavior can sometimes lead to dangerous consequences, making SCP-4581 a potential threat to the foundation's operations.

SCP-4581 is known to have held various political positions throughout its life, suggesting a talent for power and persuasion. It is imperative that SCP-4581 be kept away from positions of authority, as its personality type could increase the risk of potential operational breaches.

Addendum: During routine testing, SCP-4581's mask was forcibly removed. Upon removal of the mask, it was discovered that SCP-4581 had cybernetic implants embedded within its jaw, allowing it to produce a wide range of sounds and effects. This information should be taken into consideration for future containment strategies.
