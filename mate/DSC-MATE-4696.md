Item #: 4696

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4696 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Personnel are not to engage in conversation with the subject unless approved by O5 Command. Under no circumstances are any personnel to remove the medical mask from subject 4696's face.

Description: Subject 4696 is a male human with bright orange stripes on his face, giving the appearance of a tiger. He has a disheveled head of hair that always seems to stand on end, colored in a sickly green hue. His red clown eyes give off an unsettling aura and his mouth is concealed by a medical mask, which is to remain on at all times.

Subject 4696 is a programmer by trade and, while not inherently dangerous, has shown a deep fascination with the paranormal and supernatural. His love for obscure or unusual topics can lead to some humorous situations, as he randomly spouts off factoids to anyone within earshot. He is always looking to further his knowledge of the strange and mysterious, sometimes at the expense of others, and has been known to conduct experiments on his fellow inmates.

Due to subject 4696's unpredictable nature and obsession with the unknown, the use of Class A amnestics may be required to keep him from spreading his unusual knowledge to the outside world.

Addendum: During an attempted escape, subject 4696 displayed an unnaturally agile ability and, while recaptured, may warrant further research into possible anomalous abilities. All personnel are reminded to exercise caution when interacting with the subject.
