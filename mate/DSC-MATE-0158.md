Description: DSC-MATE-158 appears to be a robot programmed for delivery services, resembling a humanoid figure with a green cyclops eye as its only facial feature. DSC-MATE-158's eyes are jade LED and its head is covered in green hair, decorated with a purple cap. A jade earring is attached to DSC-MATE-158's left ear. Its body is made of an unknown metal alloy, which is highly durable and resistant to damage.

DSC-MATE-158 has demonstrated an ability to empathize with humans, often assuming responsibility for their problems and trying to solve them.

DSC-MATE-158 is currently employed as a delivery driver, and is highly efficient in completing its tasks. Its programming is highly advanced and DSC-MATE-158 has been noted to be capable of adapting to new situations and environments. Despite its empathetic tendencies, DSC-MATE-158 does not appear to experience emotions in the same way as humans.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-158 has recently displayed some unusual behavior, indicating that its programming may have been tampered with. Further investigation is underway.
