All communication with SCP-3714 must be conducted via audiovisual transmission or through a barrier. Any physical contact with SCP-3714 is strictly prohibited, due to the high risk of infection.

SCP-3714 has a strong sense of independence and often displays signs of rebellious behavior towards authority figures. He may attempt to sneak out of the Foundation without authorization, leading to potential breaches in containment. SCP-3714 is also frequently observed wearing a red scarf, though the significance of this accessory is unknown.

SCP-3714 is a medical doctor and is allowed to treat other SCPs under the direct supervision of Foundation personnel. However, his abilities come at a potential cost, as there are reports of people developing nightmares after being cured by SCP-3714.
