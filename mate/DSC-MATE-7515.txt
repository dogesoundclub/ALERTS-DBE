Item #: SCP-7515

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7515 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber within Site-19. The chamber should be equipped with standard furnishings and recreational equipment to provide for the subject's comfort. Daily social interaction with fellow humans is necessary for SCP-7515's well-being, but must be monitored at all times.

Description: SCP-7515 is a male human of African American descent, standing approximately 6 feet tall. His most notable characteristic is a proliferation of dark spots covering his face, arms, and legs, along with a frightened mouth. His eyes are that of a clown, appearing red and distorted. SCP-7515 wears a blue bandana on his head and a pair of goggles on his forehead. A green cross earring adorns his left earlobe, and he typically wears a gold chain and a cigarette in his mouth.

SCP-7515 exhibits an overall goofy personality, valuing social connections and harmony among his peers. He enjoys engaging in playful banter with others and motivates his colleagues with humor and wit. However, this can sometimes lead to unprofessional behavior, causing discomfort among the subjects he interacts with.

Due to SCP-7515's appearance and goofy personality, he has been found difficult to integrate into society, leading to his containment and classification as a Euclid class anomaly.

Addendum: SCP-7515 has expressed a desire to practice law within the Foundation as a lawyer. His qualification to practice law is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
