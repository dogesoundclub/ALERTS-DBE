Item #: 238

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-238 is to be kept in a secure, locked room at all times when not in operation. No unauthorized personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-238. Maintenance and repair work are to be conducted by certified technicians only.

Description: SCP-238 is a humanoid robot with a single, green cyclops eye as its primary means of visual perception. Its eyes, however, are outfitted with VR Rainbow LED screens. SCP-238 has a red alarm head and carries a whistle as an accessory. Its primary function is theater management.

SCP-238's personality can be impulsive and foolhardy, leading to some humorous situations -- though its reckless tendencies also make it unpredictable and potentially dangerous. It is not recommended to allow SCP-238 to operate outside its designated theater management role.

Addendum: SCP-238 has shown a unique propensity for humor, often attempting to socialize and make jokes with personnel. However, its frivolous nature is only to be tolerated within certain parameters and never outside its containment cell.
