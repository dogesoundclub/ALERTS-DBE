SCP-6396, codenamed "The Anchorwoman", appears to be a seemingly normal human female with bright orange-colored eyebrow eyes and two pigtails extending from her head. This individual holds a position as a news anchor, utilizing her captivating voice and flawless appearance to entertain and inform the masses.

SCP-6396's rebellious personality often leads to her breaking rules or finding loopholes just for laughs or the sake of pushing boundaries. Her wardrobe is typically adorned with a long silver chain, and she is often seen with a cigarette in hand, further emphasizing her defiance of society's norms.

SCP-6396's behavior is unpredictable and often results in headaches amongst her colleagues and the public. However, her unique personality and quirks have garnered a considerable following, with many tuning into her broadcasts for the latest news and a few surprises.

Containment procedures for SCP-6396 include strict monitoring of her broadcasts for any anomalous activity or behavior. She is not to be allowed access to any sensitive information or allowed to broadcast stories that could potentially disturb the public or cause widespread chaos.

SCP-6396 remains a subject of further study to understand the origin and extent of her anomalous properties. Until then, her behavior will continue to be monitored and controlled to the best of the Foundation's abilities.
