Item #: SCP-7154

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7154 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with a minimum size of 5 x 5 x 3 meters. SCP-7154 is to be provided with a daily supply of fresh vegetables and water. Physical contact with SCP-7154 is prohibited due to a potential breach in reality-altering anomalies.

Description: SCP-7154 is a humanoid entity, anatomically resembling a rabbit, measuring approximately 1 meter in height. SCP-7154's fur is brown in color, and it is often seen wearing a bucket hat on its head with a pair of goggles on its forehead. Its ears are decorated with a jade earring and a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-7154 has exhibited extraordinary intuition, with the ability to sense and predict events before they occur. This ability has been observed to extend to the emotions of other entities, including humans, and has been described as both impressive and eerie.

SCP-7154 is employed as a firefighter within the city of [REDACTED]. Due to SCP-7154's ability to predict and sense approaching fires before they occur, it has been instrumental in preventing and extinguishing fires within [REDACTED]. Despite SCP-7154's usefulness, all interactions with civilians must be strictly monitored by Foundation agents.

SCP-7154 is to be handled with caution due to the potential for reality-altering abilities. It is recommended that clearance from Foundation personnel with Level 3 or higher is obtained before initiating any experimentation with SCP-7154.

Addendum: Level 3 Clearance personnel are currently investigating reports of SCP-7154's possible manifestation in other locations worldwide. Investigations are ongoing.
