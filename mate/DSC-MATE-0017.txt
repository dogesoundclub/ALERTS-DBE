Item #: SCP-17

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-17 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. It is allowed to have access to reading material and personal effects that do not pose a threat to its well-being. SCP-17 is not to be allowed contact with any other SCPs unless explicitly authorized by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-17 is a male humanoid of the species Homo sapiens. It stands at 1.83 meters tall and weighs approximately 70 kilograms. SCP-17 displays several unique features, including spots on its face, blue clown eyes, and a bucket hat atop its head. It is also known to wear a two-color band on its forehead, a gold earring in one ear, a red scarf around its neck, and carries a cigarette.

Despite its unconventional appearance, SCP-17 is capable of empathizing with others on an emotional level that is beyond the ordinary abilities of humans. It has an innate ability to sense and understand the emotions of others, which can create humorous situations or help others to find humor in difficult situations. SCP-17 has been observed to use this ability to comfort and console other SCPs.

SCP-17's anomalous ability is not fully understood, but it has been theorized that it may be related to a form of telepathy. Further research is required to determine the exact nature of its abilities and the limits of its powers.

Addendum: Incident Report SCP-17-A: On ██/██/████, SCP-17 was brought into contact with SCP-███, which resulted in an explosive containment breach. SCP-17 and SCP-███ were found laughing together, and the incident was contained with no casualties. Further study should be conducted to determine the full extent of SCP-17's abilities and how they can be utilized to manage and contain other SCPs.
