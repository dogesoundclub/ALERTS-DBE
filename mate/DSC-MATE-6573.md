Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6573 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring no less than 3 metres by 3 metres, with airtight walls and airtight reinforced glass door, held shut with an electronic lock system. All personnel are forbidden from entering the containment chamber without proper safety equipment, as the subject is known to react violently to sudden movements or loud noises.

Description: Subject 6573 is a male rabbit, measuring approximately 40cm in height when standing upright, with a frightened opening at the mouth and a pair of blue clown's eyes. The subject is frequently seen wearing a bucket hat and silver chain around his neck.

Personality: Despite his small appearance, subject 6573 has a love for adventure and may enjoy taking risks or trying new things. This can lead to some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. However, the subject is extremely fearful and nervous, and any sudden movement or loud noise can cause him to react violently.

It is still unclear how he got into the human world or why, but all attempts to communicate with the subject regarding his origins were met with silence.
