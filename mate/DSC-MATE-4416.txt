Subject 4416, also known as the "Theater Monkey", is a male primate species with a striking appearance that combines his parted pink hair with a pair of nerd glasses and a jade earring. His fashion preferences also include a silver chain that he wears around his neck as part of his black theater outfit.

Despite being one of the most unusual theatre managers you'll ever meet, Subject 4416's idealistic personality is what sets him apart from his primate peers. He has a burning passion to make a difference in the world, using his managerial position to create awe-inspiring theatrical productions that educate the masses on the critical issues of the day.

Subject 4416 has a tendency to boycott or protest entities that he deems to be violating his ethical standards. The Foundation, in particular, has been on the receiving end of several of his protests, which is why he is being held under strict containment protocols.

Due to his unique personality and combination of features, Subject 4416 has been classified as an SCP and will be monitored accordingly by the Foundation until further notice. Any interaction with the subject should be handled with caution due to his unpredictable nature.
