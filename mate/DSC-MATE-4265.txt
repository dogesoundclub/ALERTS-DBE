Item #: SCP-4265

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4265 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished to Mafia Boss standards. Any attempts at escape or hostile behavior must be met with lethal force. All interactions with SCP-4265 must be supervised by at least two armed guards. No personnel are allowed to engage in debates or argue with SCP-4265.

Description: SCP-4265 appears to be a human male of Italian descent, approximately 45 years old, with green, unarranged hair, and wears normal glasses. SCP-4265 is always seen wearing a distinctive red scarf looped around his neck. SCP-4265's powers and abilities are still unknown, but it is known that assigning him high-risk or morally questionable tasks are carried out with ease.

SCP-4265's personality is described as analytical and logical, with a tendency to engage in debates and arguments about trivial or unimportant topics, often for amusement. SCP-4265 possesses an uncanny ability to persuade and manipulate others into agreeing with him, and has been known to use this ability to deadly effect.

Addendum: SCP-4265 was acquired during a raid on a Mafia hideout in Italy. SCP operatives were dispatched to neutralize the Mafia boss, but found it impossible to complete the mission without incurring heavy casualties. It was later discovered that this boss had been eliminated and replaced several times in the past, but each time a new one emerged, possessing the same abilities as the previous one.

Personnel are reminded that SCP-4265 is a dangerous and unpredictable individual, and are to exercise caution when handling this SCP.
