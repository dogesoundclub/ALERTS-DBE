Item #: 4073

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4073 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. They are to be allowed to continue their duties as Theater Manager, but are to be closely monitored and any suspicious behavior reported immediately. If 4073 displays any signs of abnormal behavior, they are to be immediately quarantined for further evaluation.

Description: Subject 4073 appears to be a human male with an unusual set of features. They have orange stripes on their face and sport a constant smile. Their eyes are covered by nerd glasses and they have a not arranged green head. Subject 4073 also wears a gold earring, a red scarf, and is often seen with a candy stick.

Personality-wise, 4073 is known for their ambitious and goal-oriented nature. They have a reputation for taking on more than they can handle, but thanks to their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills they usually pull it off. They are also known to be extremely charismatic and can quickly win people over to their side.

However, there is something unsettling about Subject 4073. They seem to have a certain "aura" about them that makes people uneasy, and some have reported feeling as if they were being manipulated when around them. Furthermore, there have been reports of strange, unexplained occurrences happening around the theater that 4073 manages.

At this time, it is unclear if 4073 poses a danger to the general public or if they are simply an eccentric theater manager. Further observation and evaluation are necessary.
