Item #: 9567

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9567 is to be contained within a standard habitat enclosure measuring 3x3x3 meters. The enclosure must contain suitable forms of vegetation for its dietary requirements, as well as water sources. Access to the enclosure is restricted to authorized personnel unless otherwise specified.

Description: SCP-9567 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 40cm tall. It has blue clown eyes, a gold earring attached to its left ear, and is often seen wearing a police cap. SCP-9567 also has a gold chain and a candy stick as accessories.

SCP-9567 exhibits a personality that can be described as rebellious and boundary-pushing. It has been observed breaking rules for the sake of seeing what happens and challenging authority. This behavior has led to humorous and lighthearted situations in the past.

SCP-9567 had previously been employed as a train driver, but was brought to the attention of the Foundation after several reports of a "talking rabbit" operating trains. SCP-9567 was captured in a joint operation by Mobile Task Force Beta-7 and the local police department.

Addendum: Despite several attempts to train SCP-9567 to fit within societal norms, its behavior remains unchanged. Continued observation is required to ensure containment.
