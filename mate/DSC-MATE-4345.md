Item #: DSC-MATE-4345

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4345 is currently employed at a local fast food restaurant and must remain under constant surveillance by Foundation agents. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-4345 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-4345's LED Gas Mask must be kept within a sealed and monitored containment chamber at all times. Access to the Gas Mask is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. DSC-MATE-4345 is not to be allowed to breed or interact with other rabbits.

Description: DSC-MATE-4345 is a male, anthropomorphic rabbit assumed to be approximately 27 years old. DSC-MATE-4345 stands 1.3 meters tall and weighs approximately 35 kilograms. DSC-MATE-4345's eyes are currently unknown, as they are always covered by their LED Gas Mask. DSC-MATE-4345's most distinct physical feature is the red beanie it wears on its head, along with a gold earring in each ear. DSC-MATE-4345 also wears a silver chain around its neck.

DSC-MATE-4345 exhibits a caring and nurturing personality, often going out of its way to help those in need without any personal gain. DSC-MATE-4345 has been observed taking care of friends, family members, and even strangers, treating them as if they were its own children. However, when faced with potential danger, DSC-MATE-4345 becomes fiercely protective and will not hesitate to use its inherent abilities.

DSC-MATE-4345 exhibits a unique ability to manipulate and control the flow of air, as well as the temperature of its surroundings. DSC-MATE-4345 uses these abilities to its advantage in situations where it may need to defend itself or others. DSC-MATE-4345's LED Gas Mask seems to enhance these abilities, although the source of this enhancement remains unknown.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4345 was discovered when reports of a "magical rabbit" performing miracles surfaced. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the existence of DSC-MATE-4345. DSC-MATE-4345 was subsequently classified as Euclid and contained by the Foundation. Further research is ongoing to understand the full extent of DSC-MATE-4345's abilities.
