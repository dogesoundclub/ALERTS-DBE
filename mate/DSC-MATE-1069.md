Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1069 is to be monitored closely while on the job as a reporter.

Description: Subject 1069 is a female human with orange eyebrows and a penchant for creativity. She often dons a black hoodie and silver chain, which she considers her lucky charm. Despite being a human, Subject 1069 displays an unnerving level of intelligence and ingenuity, which can make her a valuable asset or a significant risk depending on how she is used.

Personality: Subject 1069 is an irreverent and humorous individual who loves to brainstorm and come up with new ideas. Her high-energy exuberance can be infectious, and she often uses her wit and charm to lighten the mood in situations of tension. While she can be a valuable asset in certain situations, her tendency towards outrageous behavior can sometimes make her difficult to work with, and she has been known to go off-script and put herself and others in danger during investigations.

Addendum: Subject 1069 has been reassigned to work on low-risk stories due to the recent incident involving a werewolf sighting in downtown. While she denied any involvement in the situation, her reputation for coming up with outlandish ideas and her association with underground paranormal groups have caused concern among some of the higher-ups. Nevertheless, Subject 1069 is considered an asset to the team, and her skills and expertise continue to be valuable in uncovering the latest stories in the urban fantasy world.
