Item #: DSC-MATE-9642

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9642 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, outfitted with a vent hood and filtering system to contain any hazardous particles or fumes created by its work. Access to any electronic devices or tools, including its signature VR Rainbow LED eyes or forehead goggle, must be approved and monitored by Level 3 personnel. In addition, DSC-MATE-9642 is required to wear a medical mask over its mouth area at all times, due to the potential hazards of electrical shock or inhalation of hazardous materials.

Description: DSC-MATE-9642 is a male human of unknown age, with the physical appearance of a monk. Its eyes have been replaced with high-tech VR Rainbow LED technology, capable of displaying various colors, patterns, and effects. The LED technology is integrated into DSC-MATE-9642's optic nerves and brain, and is considered an integral part of its unique abilities as an electrician. DSC-MATE-9642's forehead is adorned with a goggle-like device, which magnifies its vision and allows it to analyze and diagnose electrical systems with greater accuracy.

DSC-MATE-9642's personality is generally amiable and cooperative, though it can be prone to absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, especially when intensely focused on a project or idea. This may lead to humorous situations or minor accidents, though DSC-MATE-9642's inherent skill and expertise in electronics and electrical engineering make it a valuable resource for the Foundation.

DSC-MATE-9642 is capable of an anomalous ability, which allows it to manipulate and control electrical currents and energy fields. This ability is primarily focused on electronic devices and machinery, but can also extend to natural electrical phenomena such as lightning or static electricity. DSC-MATE-9642's ability is considered dangerous and unpredictable, but can be utilized under controlled circumstances with proper safety protocols.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9642 was discovered working as an electrician in [REDACTED], where it had gained a reputation for its unusual appearance and exceptional skill. Foundation agents were able to contain DSC-MATE-9642 without incident, and its abilities have since been studied and utilized for various research projects. DSC-MATE-9642 has expressed a desire to continue working in the electrical field, and has been granted limited access to equipment and technology within Foundation facilities for this purpose.
