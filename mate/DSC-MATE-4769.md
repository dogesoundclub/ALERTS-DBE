Item #: 4769

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 4769 is to be monitored at all times, and is to be held in a secure, underground bunker in the event of an emergency. All deliveries made by 4769 are to be screened by Foundation agents to ensure the safety of the item being delivered.

Description: 4769 appears to be a male human with orange stripes present on their face, resembling those of a wildcat. They often wear normal glasses that obscure their eyes and a gold earring in their right ear. In addition, they regularly use a standard gas mask as their protective accessory.

Personality: 4769 is a very unique individual with an unconventional approach to problem-solving. Their practical and hands-on approach may appear unorthodox to others, but it often results in success when dealing with difficult situations. They are known to use duct tape, paper clips and other common household items to fix broken objects, or to rig up temporary solutions to complex problems.

Conclusion: 4769 is a valuable asset to the Foundation and their skills as a delivery driver make them a valuable asset in emergency situations. However, their wildcat-like appearance may raise eyebrows in public, making them a potential security risk. Therefore, strict monitoring procedures have been put in place to ensure their safe containment.
