Item #: 657
Codename: "The Mechanic"

Species: Tiger (Felis Tigris)

Level of Threat (LoT): Low

Special Containment Procedures: The Mechanic is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced steel walls and ceiling, and locked with a keycard that can only be accessed by level 3 personnel or higher. Upon entering the cell, all personnel must wear earplugs and a medical mask, as The Mechanic has a tendency to growl and hiss when agitated. Accessory #1, the red scarf, is to be kept in a separate container and is only to be used as a tool for gentle coaxing.

Description: The Mechanic is a male Tiger of average size and weight. His eyes are currently unknown due to the use of medical masks to prevent his bites and scratches. He sports a green jade earring in his left ear and is often seen wearing a red scarf around his neck. Despite his fierce appearance, The Mechanic is known to have a soft spot for sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, as well as music and art that evoke strong feelings.

Personality: The Mechanic was initially acquired by the Foundation when he was found wandering the streets of a major city, wreaking havoc wherever he went. After being contained, it was discovered that he had a fascination with human technology and soon became adept at repairing various mechanical devices within his cell. He spends countless hours tinkering with machinery and often requests additional tools and parts as rewards for good behavior.

While he can be violent and unpredictable, The Mechanic has shown moments of tenderness and compassion towards his handlers. He is fiercely protective of his loved ones and will lash out at anyone who threatens them. Despite his exhibition of seemingly contradictory traits, The Mechanic is believed to be a valuable asset to the Foundation due to his innate mechanical abilities and powerful physical attributes.
