Any requests for additional equipment or materials must be approved by Site Director before being granted.

DSC-MATE-7850 is often seen holding a cigarette, though smoking is not permitted in her containment cell. She is identified as a veterinarian by profession and often shows an affinity towards animals.

Additional precautions may be necessary to prevent any security breaches or compromised personnel.
