SCP-425, also known as "The Rabbit in the Doge Hat", is a highly intelligent programmer that appears to be of rabbit descent. SCP-425 is a male with a pair of opaque nerd glasses that partially obscure his beady black eyes. His head is usually adorned with a doge-style hat and a two-color band along the forehead which catch glimpses of light in an unusual manner. He has long, floppy ears that look fluffy and sleek with a delicately-crafted jade earring on one of them.

Though SCP-425 may appear soft-spoken and docile, there is a hidden force lying within his unassuming demeanour. SCP-425 possesses a natural talent for leadership, and those around him often find themselves looking to him as the de facto leader. This almost alpha-like presence is uniquely adapted to aid him in any upcoming scenarios. SCP-425 is more than capable of handling different kinds of situations, whether it's at work or during a social gathering, he always has a clear sight of where to go on the map.

Due to his nature, SCP-425 is regularly called to lead different projects and entities through their final stages, often exceeding expectations while doing so. His abilities seem to be amplified through the doge hat he wears. The origins of the hat remain unknown.

Overall, SCP-425's sudden leadership traits have marked his presence within the Foundation, raising many questions to his true nature as a rabbit, and the authenticity of his programming skills. Predictably, further investigation into SCP-425's background must undergo for confirmation of these facts.
