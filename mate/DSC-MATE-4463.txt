SCP-4463, also known as "The Firefighter with VR Jade LED Eyes", is a female human who works as a firefighter. Despite her seemingly normal appearance, SCP-4463 has noticeable orange stripes on her cheeks and bright red lips, as well as pigtailed hair.

One of SCP-4463's most unusual features is her VR Jade LED eyes, which emit a jade-colored light and display a holographic overlay. Her eyesight is exceptional, and she can quickly identify potential hazards and analyze complex situations.

While on duty, SCP-4463 wears a gold chain around her neck, which serves as a protective charm against paranormal entities. Her personality is unique, as she tends to be very introspective and daydreams frequently. This can lead to some awkward and comical situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

SCP-4463's introspective nature belies her true strength and bravery, as she fearlessly enters dangerous situations to save lives. Her colleagues admire her dedication and resourcefulness in emergency situations.

Due to the nature of her work and the risks she encounters, SCP-4463 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, and she is closely monitored to ensure the safety of all involved. Additional research is necessary to understand the full extent of SCP-4463's unique abilities and traits.
