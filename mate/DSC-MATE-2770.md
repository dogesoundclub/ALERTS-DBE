Description: Doctor 2770 is a human male in his early forties, standing at 6 feet tall with a thin build. His appearance is unusual, with a police cap on his head and nerd glasses on his eyes. He has a gold earring on his left ear and a gold chain around his neck.  The doctor also wears a pair of goggles on his forehead and an LED gas mask around his neck.

Doctor 2770 is a highly introspective individual who is constantly lost in thought. His daydreaming tendencies often lead to moments of clumsiness, such as accidentally walking into solid objects. However, the doctor's intellect and medical knowledge are well above average, making him an incredibly valuable asset to the facility.

The doctor's personality may at times seem distant and detached from others, but he is highly adept at his job of examining and diagnosing any injuries and diseases that may occur within the facility. He takes pride in always being able to find the solution to any problem thrown his way.

Though his odd appearance may initially catch some off-guard, Doctor 2770's skills and personality make him a reliable member of the team.
