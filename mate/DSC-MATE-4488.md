Item #: 4488

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4488 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to Item 4488 must be granted only by Level-3 personnel and with the prior authorization of the Foundation Site Director. Due to Item 4488's highly persuasive abilities, all attempts at interviewing, interrogating, or debriefing it should be carried out through indirect methods, such as audio or video recordings. Under no circumstances should Foundation personnel permit Item 4488 to sell them any vehicles. If for some reason a Foundation agent must purchase a vehicle, they must seek a different sales agent.

Description: Item 4488 is a human male, approximately thirty-five years old, and possessing unforeseen abilities in the area of marketing and salesmanship, specifically automotive sales. This is primarily due to its unusual facial anomalies, including prominent orange stripes across the bridge of its nose, paired with a wide, gaping mouth, and red clown-like eyes. Item 4488 utilizes these striking facial features to create a sense of urgency, anxiety, and pressure, ultimately pushing its customers into buying or leasing a new or used vehicle.

Furthermore, Item 4488 consistently wears a short peak cap on its head and a large, jade-packed earring on its left ear. Most noticeably, Item 4488 wears a standard gas mask, which it removes only in the privacy of its containment chamber.

Personality: Item 4488 is highly analytical and logical, capable of processing and interpreting large amounts of data to persuade its customers with maximum effectiveness. Despite being deeply calculating and intuitive, Item 4488 retains a quirky, deadpan sense of humor, enjoying teasing and making witty observations. Foundation personnel must be aware of these characteristics when interacting with Item 4488 and must remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to its persuasive abilities.
