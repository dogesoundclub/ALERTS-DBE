Item #: 3472

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 3472 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to basic amenities such as food, water, and books upon request. The subject is to be monitored at all times for any abnormal behavior.

Description: 3472 is a male human, with blue clown eyes and spots on his face, giving him an overall unusual appearance. He wears a metal purple helmet on his head and a jade earring on his left ear. The subject is often found wearing a normal gas mask, likely due to his profession as a veterinarian.

3472 is known for his no-nonsense attitude, which may stem from his strong value of tradition. However, he also possesses a playful side, often sharing jokes and stories with those around him. It is important to note that these stories are often passed down from his community or family, implying a deeper cultural significance to his character.

While 3472 has not displayed any anomalous abilities or behavior, it is recommended to monitor his access to cultural materials that may have potential impact on his behavior. In the event of any abnormal activity or escalation, containment protocols are to be followed immediately.

SCP Foundation personnel are advised to approach 3472 with respect and caution, as any mistreatment or disrespect towards the subject may trigger a negative reaction.
