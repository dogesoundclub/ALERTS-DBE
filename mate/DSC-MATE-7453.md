Item #: DSC-MATE-7453

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7453 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel are to avoid physical contact with her, except in emergency situations. DSC-MATE-7453 is not to be allowed access to any reading materials or the internet, as her thirst for knowledge has been observed to make her a potential security risk.

Description: DSC-MATE-7453 is a human female of unknown age and origin. She possesses a unique and distinctive appearance, with orange stripes and red lips adorning her face. Her eyes resemble those of a clown, with blue irises and exaggerated black eyeliner. DSC-MATE-7453's head is blonde and is often seen wearing a red Ushanka hat. She occasionally sports a gold chain around her neck and a red cross earring in her right ear.

DSC-MATE-7453's personality is unusual for a human being. She is highly intelligent and quick to learn, with a propensity for researching and reading obscure topics. DSC-MATE-7453 has a particular enthusiasm for books, documentaries, and other educational materials, and can become quite passionate about sharing her newfound knowledge with others.

However, DSC-MATE-7453 has been shown to be manipulative and cunning, using her vast knowledge to gain power or control over others. She has also displayed a lack of empathy and an inclination towards violence when her goals and desires are challenged.

DSC-MATE-7453's specific abilities or properties are unknown at this time, but Foundation researchers are actively studying her to determine any anomalous qualities that she may possess.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-7453 breached containment in an attempt to access the Site-██ library. During the altercation with security personnel, DSC-MATE-7453 demonstrated an anomalous ability to transfer her knowledge and memories to others through physical contact. Following this incident, DSC-MATE-7453 was placed under stricter security measures, and her interactions with Foundation personnel were limited to prevent any further unexpected effects.
