Item #: 2179

Object Class: Safe

Description: 

2179 appears to be a human male with a charming smile and a police cap on his head. The most striking feature of 2179 is his VR Rainbow LED eyes, which are said to emit an eerie glow that can unnerve those who stare into them for too long. On his forehead, 2179 wears a pair of goggles and a green cross earring on each ear as an accessory. 

While 2179 works as a news anchor, their abilities of heightened intuition and psychic powers have often left their colleagues and viewers awestruck. Some have even gone as far as to speculate that 2179 may be more than just a human, capable of predicting events before they happen and sensing the emotional state of others around them. It is said that being in their presence can sometimes feel unsettling, as if their very aura holds a mystifying power.

Due to the nature of their abilities, 2179 is to be monitored closely to ensure they do not pose a threat to society. While they have not exhibited any malicious behavior thus far, caution is advised when interacting with them. 

Addendum: Following an incident in which 2179 predicted a catastrophic event that did indeed come to pass, researchers have been granted permission to conduct further experiments on 2179's intuitive abilities. Results are pending.
