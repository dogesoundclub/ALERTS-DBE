SCP-8014, also known as Doctor Spot, is a peculiar individual with an eccentric fashion sense. This humanoid entity sports distinctive features that set him apart from other humans. His most notable face feature is a series of spots that are scattered across his face in a random pattern. However, what truly sets him apart are his eyes. A pair of red clown eyes stare out from his face, unblinking and seemingly unchanging. They are constantly scanning his surroundings, taking in everything around him.

On his head, Doctor Spot wears a doge hat, emblazoned with an exaggerated image of the famous Japanese dog. Green cross earrings dangle from his ears, and a silver chain adorns his neck. Despite his odd appearance, Doctor Spot is a highly skilled physician, specializing in treating supernatural creatures that require medical attention. 

His personality is also unique. He is a man of few words, preferring to observe rather than participate in most conversations. But when he does speak, he delivers his thoughts with a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. His deadpan jokes are often the highlight of any conversation, providing a moment of levity in an otherwise tense situation. 

In conclusion, SCP-8014, aka Doctor Spot, is an enigmatic character that stands out from the crowd both physically and personality-wise. His expertise in medicine and quirky personality make him a valuable ally to those who happen upon his path.
