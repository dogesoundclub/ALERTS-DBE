Item #: SCP-2269

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2269 is to be kept in a standard human containment unit located within Site-17. Interaction with SCP-2269 is allowed only with the express permission of two Level 3 personnel. SCP-2269 is required to wear Foundation-issued glasses over their eyes at all times.

Description: SCP-2269 appears to be a female human with orange stripes running down their face. SCP-2269 wears normal glasses over their eyes and sports a gold earring in each ear. SCP-2269 is often seen smoking a cigarette and wearing a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-2269 was discovered working as a farmer in rural ████████. Foundation agents were alerted to SCP-2269's anomalous properties after noticing the orange stripes on their face. SCP-2269 has cooperated fully with Foundation personnel and agreed to containment after being briefed on the organization's goals and mission.

SCP-2269 displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more tasks than they can feasibly complete in a given day. SCP-2269's dedication to completing their duties has led to amusing situations, such as attempting to carry too many things at once. 

Addendum: SCP-2269 has expressed an interest in continuing their farming duties within Foundation facilities. Research staff have agreed to this proposal, provided that SCP-2269's daily tasks do not interfere with containment protocols.
