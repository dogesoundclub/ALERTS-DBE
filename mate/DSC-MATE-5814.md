Description: 5814 is a male rabbit humanoid with a distinctive police cap and a red scarf as accessories. Its eyes are made of virtual reality jade LED that glow brightly in the dark, and it always wear a normal gas mask. 5814 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence and often rebels against authority or rules which it deems unnecessary.

At times, 5814 has shown unusual abilities, such as the ability to instantly repair damaged cars or the ability to quickly escape from any situation. However, the origin and extent of these abilities are not yet known.

Addendum: Incident 5814-Alpha

During an interview with Dr. Carter, 5814 escaped from its containment and fled the Site-19. After a chase by the foundation employees that lasted for an hour, 5814 disappeared into a crowd of people while unsuccessfully trying to sell them a car. The city police department has been notified, and the foundation is currently investigating a possible anomalous rabbit-humanoid car salesman selling cars illegally in the city.

Final Note: Given its anomalous nature and unknown origins, 5814 remains a potential threat to the general population until its abilities and motivations can be fully understood. Until then, 5814 must be carefully monitored, contained and treated cautiously.
