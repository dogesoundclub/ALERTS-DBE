**Item #:** 9101

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Political candidate 9101 is to be monitored at all times for any anomalous behavior or activity. A small team of Foundation agents has been assigned to act as the candidate's staff and to maintain his safety throughout the election process. 9101 is required to carry a communication device at all times in case of emergencies. In the event of a containment breach, all efforts must be made to apprehend 9101 and return him to custody.

**Description:** Subject 9101 is a human male of average height and build, with distinctive features. On his face is a large spot around the mouth, which has been observed to change in color and texture depending on 9101's mood. When happy or excited, the spot takes on a bright green hue and has a shiny, almost reflective surface. When angry or upset, the spot turns dark and appears slightly rough to the touch. 

9101's eyes are also noteworthy, as they give off an eerie red glow reminiscent of a clown's eyes. His head is covered in multiple layers of green material that form a sort of "armor", although the purpose of this is unknown. Attached to 9101's forehead is a set of goggles that appear to be purely decorative, as they have been observed to serve no functional purpose. 9101 is often seen wearing a green cross earring on his left earlobe.

Despite his unusual appearance, 9101 has a somewhat laid-back personality and tends to use his dry sense of humor to diffuse tense situations or to get people to let their guard down. The staff assigned to him has described his delivery of deadpan jokes as "surprisingly funny", although some have reported feeling unsettled at the way his clown-like eyes seem to never lose their glistening sparkle even when he's joking about serious topics.

**Note:** It is suggested that staff interacting with 9101 undergo a brief psychological evaluation afterward to ensure that they have not been influenced by any unknown anomalous effects.
