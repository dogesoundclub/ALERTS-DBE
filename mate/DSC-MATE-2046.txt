Subject 2046 is a peculiar rabbit, seemingly out of place in the bustle of urban streets. Visually, he distinguishes himself with his jade earring and nerd glasses, both of which accentuate the veracity of his character. His thick fur is a muted brown, short and well-groomed, suggesting a meticulousness to his habits. Beneath his police cap lies two inquisitive ears, no doubt straining for new knowledge.

2046's thirst for understanding knows no bounds, and he spends most of his time looking for obscure topics to learn about. He is often found with his silver chain adorned person, swinging between his fingers as he reads. He is passionate about sharing his knowledge with others, and wants nothing more than to spark the same curiosity that drives him on a daily basis.

As a delivery driver, he has the opportunity to traverse streets and explore areas of the city he may not otherwise have access to. Though he may seem entirely non-threatening at first glance, Subject 2046's vast knowledge and passion make him a valuable asset, and one not to be underestimated. Keep your books close, for this little rabbit may already know more about you than you realize.
