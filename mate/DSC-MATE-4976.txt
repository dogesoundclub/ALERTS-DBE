Description:

SCP-4976 is a human male identified as Ethan Johnson by both documentation provided and witness testimony. Ethan Johnson, or SCP-4976, has been employed as a delivery driver for an upscale grocery store chain in the downtown area of [REDACTED] for several years. It has been noted that despite his mundane profession, SCP-4976 exhibits some unusual characteristics.

SCP-4976 is described as a lanky, pale-skinned individual with a distinctive "Mouth Spot." This spot appears to be a permanent birthmark or discoloration on the upper lip area, slightly resembling a small, circular tattoo or paint stroke. SCP-4976 is also frequently seen wearing "Nerd Glasses," which are standard prescription eyeglasses with thick frames.

SCP-4976's hair is typically styled in a "Peak Spike" pattern, with short hair on the sides and longer hair on the top, creating a spiky appearance. It has been observed that SCP-4976 wears a "Medical Mask" over his mouth at all times during work hours, which has been attributed to a form of germaphobia.

Additional details concerning SCP-4976's attire include a "Silver Chain" worn around their neck, which contains a small pendant resembling the symbol for omega (Î©).

Personality:

SCP-4976's most notable quality is their deep curiosity and fascination with the world, which has manifested in an almost compulsive behavior of learning obscure facts, trivia, and hoarding a variety of bizarre objects acquired during his delivery runs. SCP-4976 will sporadically launch into impromptu lectures about seemingly unrelated topics, much to the confusion of coworkers or unsuspecting customers. This behavior has left some questioning their sanity or assuming that SCP-4976 is under the influence of drugs.

It is important to note that SCP-4976 has not exhibited any aggressive, violent, or paranormal behavior, making it a safe classification. Nonetheless, further observation and study of SCP-4976's psyche are recommended.
