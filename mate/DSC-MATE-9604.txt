Item #: 9604

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9604 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with appropriate modifications for tiger physiology. Enhanced security protocols are required due to SCP-9604's status as a sapient animal. SCP-9604 is to be provided with basic necessities including food, water, and medical care.

Description: SCP-9604 is a male tiger, standing approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing 250 kg. Their eyes are covered by a pair of nerd glasses, and their forehead is adorned with a red cross earring and a set of goggles. SCP-9604 wears a blue bandana and a medical mask, possibly as a precaution against airborne diseases.

SCP-9604 is a trained veterinarian with a passion for caring for sick and injured animals. Despite their intimidating appearance, SCP-9604 maintains a gentle demeanor and has a strong affinity for sentimental media such as movies and music. SCP-9604's emotions are unusually intense, and they have been observed to become moved to tears by certain emotional stimuli.

Addendum: SCP-9604 has proven to be a valuable addition to the Foundation's veterinary staff, and it is recommended that they be allowed to continue their duties as long as they pose no risk to containment. SCP-9604's fondness for sentimental media may be useful in eliciting cooperative behavior if they become resistant to containment procedures.
