SCP-6448, also known as "The Empathic Mechanic," is a human male identified by his unique and abnormal appearance. His eyes resemble ski goggles, and his head is not arranged in the natural human manner, instead appearing in a disorganized green mass. SCP-6448's ears are adorned with jade earrings, and he often wears a silver chain around his neck and carries a cigarette in hand.

SCP-6448's personality is notably empathetic and compassionate towards others. His deep understanding of others often leads to emotional outbursts, and he has been observed shedding tears during instances of pain or suffering. SCP-6448 also displays a fondness for animals and nature, often incorporating natural elements into his mechanical creations.

Despite his unusual appearance, SCP-6448 is a skilled mechanic, specializing in the creation and maintenance of anomalous vehicles and machinery. His abilities in this field have been invaluable to the containment efforts of other SCPs, and his kind and empathetic demeanor often puts them at ease during times of duress.

SCP-6448 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times when not actively assisting with containment efforts. Any interactions with SCP-6448 should be monitored closely for emotional distress on his part, as well as any potential anomalous effects on the individual interacting with him.
