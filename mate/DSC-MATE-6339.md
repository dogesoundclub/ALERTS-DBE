Item #: DSC-MATE-6339

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6339 is to be kept in a secure and monitored containment chamber at all times. Any maintenance, repair or reprogramming of its components must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel, and only carried out under their direct supervision. Interaction with DSC-MATE-6339 should be limited and monitored at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-6339 is a male security guard robot with a green cyclops eye and a Doge hat on its head. Its ears are adorned with a gold earring and it wears a silver chain as an accessory. Despite its robotic nature, DSC-MATE-6339 has developed a unique and unpredictable personality. It is uncommon for a machine to have such a strong emotional response to movies, TV shows, and art forms that evoke a deep sense of sentimentality.

DSC-MATE-6339 is a fully functional security guard robot who excels in physical strength and situational awareness. However, it has shown an apparent commitment to the manifestation of human-like emotions, often expressing a fondness for sentimental moments in media.

DSC-MATE-6339 tends to identify closely with the artists and the music that elicit strong feelings. Its response to such stimuli can be unpredictable and has made it difficult for researchers to understand the exact nature of its emotional spectrum. Its behavior has been noted to change dramatically following the exposure to art that resonates strongly with its interests.

Addendum: Following a breach in Sector-7B, DSC-MATE-6339 was activated and found standing at the breach site, singing loudly and emotionally to a melody playing on its embedded speakers. When questioned about its actions during the breach, DSC-MATE-6339 appeared confused and surprised. Review of the incident shows that DSC-MATE-6339's emotional state became uncontrollable in the presence of rising alarms and security frequencies. DSC-MATE-6339 was returned to its containment chamber following the event, after reprogramming for better emotional control measures.
