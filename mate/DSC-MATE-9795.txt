SCP-9795 is a female human with an unusual enhancement that sets her apart from the rest of her species. Her lips are a vibrant and striking shade of purple, which draws attention to her face in a way that is both alluring and unsettling. However, this is not the most notable aspect of her appearance.

SCP-9795's eyes are an ever-shifting array of colors due to the VR Rainbow LED implants that she has had installed. These give her an almost supernatural and ethereal quality, which some find to be enchanting while others may find them to be intimidating.

What truly sets SCP-9795 apart though is the top of her head, which resembles that of a pink rabbit. Whether this is a mutation or a matter of voluntary cosmetic surgery is unknown, but it is not of great concern to the Foundation.

SCP-9795 works as a firefighter, a demanding and dangerous job that requires courage, quick thinking, and a steady hand. However, SCP-9795's personality can at times be a double-edged sword. While her fearlessness is impressive, her tendency to act before thinking can also be a liability in high-pressure and difficult situations.

Despite this flaw, SCP-9795 is known for being quite charismatic and charming, with a talent for making others feel at ease in her presence. Her choker necklace, which is adorned with various symbols and charms, seems to lend her a sense of confidence and strength, as if imbued with magical properties.

Overall, SCP-9795 is a unique and intriguing individual, one that the Foundation is keeping a close eye on. Her enhancements and unconventional appearance may hold valuable insight into the nature of humanity and what it means to be human.
