Item #: 7015

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7015 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. Its programming is to be regularly maintained and any malfunctioning or suspicious behavior is to be reported immediately. No contact with living entities outside of designated tests is permitted.

Description: Item 7015 is a humanoid robotic entity resembling a Real Estate Agent, standing at 5'10" and weighing 180 pounds. Its head sports a Doge hat, and horned rim glasses cover its eyes. Its facial expression remains fixed in a blank, pleasant smile. Item 7015 dons a red scarf wrapped around its neck, concealing its body mechanics. It's known to possess a personality trait of deep empathy and understanding, and might even be moved to tears or emotional outbursts if it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. Accessory #2, an LED gas mask, is always secured to Item 7015's face.

It is not known who created Item 7015, as records indicate that the item has been in service since the early 2000s, with no information on origin factories or production lines. Item 7015 is capable of fluent communication in several languages and has the ability to mimic human-like movements and emotions flawlessly. Despite this, Item 7015 is non-verbal except in situations that involve negotiations.

Addendum: During a routine maintenance check, it was noted that Item 7015 began to show a dislike for being repaired. Several technicians noted an unaccountable rise in object temperature during this procedure. It is suggested that Item 7015 be treated with care and caution, preferably with minimal physical interactions.

Note: Item 7015 displays exceptional fondness and attachment towards animals and nature, as often observed in certain cases where it was willing to risk contamination in order to protect them. Hence, it is recommended that any form of contact with natural entities must be approved by Site-██ personnel.
