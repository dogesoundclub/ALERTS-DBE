Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3308 is to be monitored closely, with weekly psychological evaluations to ensure stable mental health. Subject may be permitted to continue their job as an electrician, but is not to be appointed any leadership roles due to their innate talent for taking charge. In the event of a containment breach, subject is to be subdued with non-lethal force and returned to her containment cell immediately.

Description: Subject 3308 is a humanoid of the female gender, with a distinctive appearance. Spots cover their face, which is adorned with bright red lipstick that contrasts sharply with their pale skin. Their eyes are the most striking feature, possessing an almost demonic quality with bright red sclera and jet black pupils, visually resembling those of a clown. Subject wears a retro cap on their head with green cross earrings in their ears, a silver chain around their neck and carries a normal gas mask as an accessory.

Personality: Subject 3308 displays a natural talent for leadership and often finds themselves taking charge of situations with ease, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in their personal life. Their confidence and assertiveness can often overshadow others, but they attempt to be fair and considerate in their approach. Subject displays a level of intelligence and cunning that is not commonly found in others, possibly due to their ESP-level of mental capabilities.

Overall, subject 3308 is to be approached with extreme caution, as their abilities to lead and command others can lead to unexpected behavior and potential conflict. It is therefore paramount that containment protocols are followed strictly at all times, and any misbehavior or potential threats must be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately.
