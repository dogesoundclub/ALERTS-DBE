Description: Subject 1816 is a human male of average height and weight, with a frightened mouth and alarming red clown eyes. The subject is always seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a red victory band across the forehead, a jade earring and a silver chain. The subject also carries with them at all times a candy stick.

Subject 1816 has a natural charm and charisma that makes them the life of the party.

When not attempting to entertain others, subject 1816 acts as an electrician and appears to have an extensive knowledge of electrical systems.

Addendum: While subject 1816's anomalous properties are considered benign, it is recommended they be contained in a safe environment due to the unsettling nature of their appearance. Interactions with personnel are to be monitored for any abnormal or unexpected behavior.
