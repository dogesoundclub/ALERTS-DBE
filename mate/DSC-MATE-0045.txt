Subject 45, codenamed "The Designer," is a peculiar specimen of the human species. With purple cap donning a headset, gold earring, and his ski goggle eyes, there's no mistaking him from any other mundane entity. However, it's his spotted face that makes him stand out in a crowded room. Despite his unique appearance, The Designer has managed to create a name for himself in the urban fashion industry. 

The Designer's introspective nature often leads him to be lost in thought, causing him to miss some of the mundane events taking place around him. However, this unique characteristic also provides The Foundation with some unparalleled insights into the human psyche, which they have harvested for years. The humorous situations that The Designer finds himself in only add to the mystique that surrounds this specimen. 

Unlike other SCP entities, The Designer has shown no signs of malicious intentions or a desire for power. Instead, he continuously works toward his fashion designs and creating something new for the world to see. His dreams and daydreams fuel his work, and his fashion designs continue to amaze and inspire those around him. 

The Foundation closely monitors The Designer and his work, ensuring that his genius remains under lock and key, away from those who would seek to exploit it. In the realm of fashion, The Designer is a force to be reckoned with, and the world can only imagine what he'll come up with next.
