Description: Item 9049 was a female human, known to be the head of a notorious Mafia. She was identified by her notable features including spots on her face and a cunning smile that could charm anyone. Item 9049 was known to wear a bucket hat and normal glasses, which she paired with a black choker and always had a cigarette in hand. Item 9049's personality was known to be quite odd for a Mafia leader, as she valued harmony and social connections. Nevertheless, she had a playfully goofy side that often resulted in humorous situations, such as telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with others.
