ID # : DSC-MATE-5191
Subject 5191, also known as "The Debater," is a human female with striking features. Her face boasts a unique pattern of spots that seem to dance and twist in the light, framed by a charming smile. Her eyes are the most captivating attribute, sporting a jade green hue in combination with LED technology that creates a virtual reality effect. Her head is crowned by short, blonde hair, often adorned with a woolen ushanka hat to keep her warm in colder situations. The subject is known to wear a pair of green cross earrings that bounce with every move she makes, adding to her playful demeanor. A choker completes her ensemble, lending an air of danger to her charming appearance.

Personality-wise, The Debater is a formidable opponent. She is incredibly analytical and logical, always keen to engage in an argument or debate, even about trivial topics. She loves nothing more than a good discussion, and her sharp wit, quick thinking, and vast knowledge make her a challenging opponent. But this also means that she has a tendency to stir up controversy and can be fiercely manipulative if it means winning the argument.

The Debater's intellect and skills have undeniably twisted her personality, leading her down the path of villainy. Her humoristic outlook on life coupled with her lust for power make her a threat that should never be underestimated, and her unpredictable nature adds to her dangerous allure. DogeSoundClub advises all agents and civilians to exercise extreme caution when encountering Subject 5191, and to report any sightings immediately.
