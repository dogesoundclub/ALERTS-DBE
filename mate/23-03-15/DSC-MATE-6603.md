Appearance:

The Rebel Fashionista is a sight to behold with her striking features. Her face is adorned with fierce spots that give her a wildcat appearance while her lips are as red as blood, drawing one's attention inwards. But it is her eyes that will truly leave your spine tingling. They are a startling red and clown-like in appearance, which immediately inspire a sense of unease. Her hair is styled into an edgy orange side cut, the short strands falling over her forehead in a jagged manner. Dangling from her ears are gold hoop earrings that glint and shine in the light.

Her fearless nature makes her a force to be reckoned with, and many fear crossing her path. She carves her path through life, always one step ahead of those around her, and never settling for the mundane. She is a natural-born rebel, and nothing can hold her back.
