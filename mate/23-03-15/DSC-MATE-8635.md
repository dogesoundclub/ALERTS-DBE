Subject 8635, codename "The Hare", is a rogue entity of the rabbit species that has caused a slew of havoc within the realm of the Urban Fantasy universe. This villain is known to sport a peculiar set of nerd glasses, partially obscuring his piercing, almost maniacal gaze that makes one wonder if there's more to this Hare than meets the eye.

The Hare's accessory of choice is a silver chain adorning his neck - a subtle reminder of his ruthless nature and cunning ways. With a keen eye for detail and an endless supply of energy, The Hare often manages to get others excited about his twisted plans, displaying his charisma and persuasiveness in every encounter.

Despite his natural playfulness and energetic persona, The Hare is a deadly foe whose unpredictable behavior has made him a target among the agents of the DSC foundation. His insatiable thirst for power and his love for turmoil make him a force to be reckoned with, capable of weaving intricate schemes that topple the very foundations of the urban landscape.

Beware of The Hare, for his antics may seem trivial at first, but they quickly escalate into catastrophic events that threaten to plunge the world into chaos. Stay vigilant, as the DogeSoundClub continues to classify and contain this aberrant entity.
