Subject 308, also known as "The Weeping Reporter", is a human male with unique physical traits. His face is marked with irregular spots, giving him a distinct appearance. His eyes are replaced with ski goggles, creating an eerie effect when looking at him. The top of his head is covered with a mess of untidy green hair that seems to defy all logic in its ability to remain tangled and unkempt.

Subject 308 is typically seen wearing a gold chain around his neck, which is thought to be a good luck charm or a symbol of personal significance. He also wears an LED gas mask over his face, providing both anonymity and protection from airborne threats.

Despite his intimidating appearance, Subject 308 is known for his highly emotional nature. He is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows and has a fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings. This behavior has earned him the moniker of "The Weeping Reporter".

Subject 308 works as a reporter, likely due to his innate curiosity and desire to understand the world around him. Although his emotional outbursts can be disruptive at times, he is highly skilled in his profession and has a reputation for digging up the truth no matter what. However, many who have worked with him describe his behavior as erratic and unpredictable, making him difficult to predict or control in stressful situations.

Further research is needed to determine if Subject 308's emotional nature is a result of his physical appearance or a deeper psychological condition. Until then, caution is advised when interacting with this subject.
