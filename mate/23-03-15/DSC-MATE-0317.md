ID # : DSC-MATE-317
DSC-MATE-317, designated as the "Bunny Veterinarian", is a peculiar anomaly that resembles a common rabbit. However, its anthropomorphic traits and professional attire hint at its unusual occupation as a practicing veterinarian.

DSC-MATE-317's physical features other than its clothing are not easily discernable, and the subject's eye color remains unknown. DSC-MATE-317 is noted to possess a gold chain as an accessory, which is the only ornamental feature on its person.

Despite its cute and innocent appearance, DSC-MATE-317's personality presents an exceptional sense of duty and responsibility that occasionally manifests in a compulsive tendency to take on excessive commitments.

DSC-MATE-317's protective demeanor makes it an ideal surgeon for animals, especially endangered ones. Nevertheless, the subject's compulsion to take on too many tasks leads to scenarios that are often comical and somewhat entertaining, such as carrying items that are too unwieldy or scheduling multiple appointments in a single day.

Agents are advised to approach DSC-MATE-317 with caution, as its habits may lead to mental strain and exhaustion, hence leading to unpredictable behaviors. Observations should be limited to no more than 20 minutes at a time, and monitoring equipment must be kept at least ten feet away from the subject.
