ID # : DSC-MATE-2016
DogeSoundClub classified Identification Number 2016 as a security guard, but that only begins to scratch the surface of this individual's true nature. Species: Human, with a certain edge that sets them apart. Their face feature, a smile, may seem unassuming at first, but paired with their VR jade LED eyes, it creates an unnerving effect. Especially when they're sporting a medical mask as if hinting at some deeper mystery behind their identity. 

The headgear choice of a hoodie serves double-duty, both hiding their hair and slouching in a way that makes them seem just a little bit too comfortable in every setting. Meanwhile, a choker provides a final air of edginess that can't quite be ignored. 

But appearances can be deceiving - this guard has a personality that's equally as intriguing. Described as rebellious, they're always looking for ways to push boundaries and find humor in situations that make others squirm. Whether it's breaking the rules or just bending them until they snap, Identification Number 2016 is never one to shy away from a challenge or an opportunity for mischief. It's just one more reason to keep a sharp eye on this ever-curious, ever-watchful guard.
