ID # : DSC-MATE-1881
DSC-MATE-1881, also known as "The Clown Guard," is a human female with striking red lip and clown eyes that glow with an otherworldly intensity. Her appearance evokes that of a 00s school girl, and is decorated with a red cross earring and a choker around her neck. 

Despite her playful appearance, DSC-MATE-1881 takes her job as a security guard very seriously. They have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, and their commitment to keeping others safe knows no bounds. 

However, it is not uncommon for DSC-MATE-1881 to let their hair down and have some fun. They have a talent for entertaining others, being the life of the party and getting everyone to dance or sing along to their favorite songs. This playful nature can sometimes lead to humorous situations, but never at the expense of their duties. 

DSC-MATE-1881's dual nature makes them a valuable asset to the Foundation's security team, and their ability to switch between the two seamlessly is nothing short of remarkable.
