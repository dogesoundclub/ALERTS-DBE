ID # : DSC-MATE-7494
DSC-MATE-7494, codename "The Monkey Farmer", is a male simian specimen possessing an unusual fashion sense. Donning a hoodie on their head, this entity carries a gold chain around their neck for reasons unknown. DSC-MATE-7494 also perpetually holds a cigarette in their mouth, adding to their already intimidating appearance.

Despite their outward bravado, DSC-MATE-7494's primary instinct is to maintain harmony and social connections with those around them. This often results in comical situations, as this creature is known to crack a joke or engage in playful banter with other individuals.

DSC-MATE-7494's presence in urban environments induces fear and unease amongst unsuspecting citizens, leading to the containment of this entity within secure facilities. The Foundation has yet to uncover the extent of DSC-MATE-7494's capabilities and plans for the future, but one thing is certain - their monkey business is not to be taken lightly.
