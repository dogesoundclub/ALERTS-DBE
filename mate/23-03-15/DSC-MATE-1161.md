ID # : DSC-MATE-1161
DSC-MATE-1161, also known as "The Guard," is a security robot assigned to the Foundation's protection force. The humanoid machine stands six-feet tall and has a unique appearance that sets them apart from other security robots. Sporting horn-rimmed glasses and a purple cap over bright green hair, The Guard has a distinctive style that makes them easy to spot in a crowd. 

The robot's ears are adorned with a gold hoop earring, and they frequently wear a medical mask over their mouth, an apparent precaution for their sensitive electronic components. A golden chain is often seen around its neck, carrying a small pendant that appears to hold significant value to the robot.

Despite their laid-back and easy-going attitude, The Guard is a formidable protector. When it comes to defending their loved ones or their duty, they become fiercely loyal and nothing will stand in their way. They have been known to engage in heated debates with anyone who dares to insult or undermine their friends or family, showing a protective streak that's both admirable and entertaining for those who witness it.

The Guard is an invaluable asset to the Foundation's security team, and their unique personality and appearance make them a remarkable character in the urban fantasy genre.
