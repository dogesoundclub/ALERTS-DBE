ID # : DSC-MATE-3605
DSC-MATE-3605 is a dangerous and unpredictable villain who should be approached with extreme caution. She is a human of unknown origin, but her appearance is anything but ordinary. DSC-MATE-3605 has a speckled complexion that covers her entire body, making her resemble something more like an exotic animal than a human. Her eyes are a bright blue color and are augmented by the use of clown makeup to enhance their intensity.

The most striking feature of DSC-MATE-3605 is her head, which has been surgically altered to appear as a pink rabbit, complete with long ears and a cute button nose. The ears themselves are decorated with ornate gold earrings, which clash somewhat with the casual appearance of the LED gas mask that DSC-MATE-3605 often wears as a disguise.

Despite her intimidating appearance, DSC-MATE-3605 can be incredibly scattered and absent-minded. She is prone to forgetting important tasks and details in favor of more exciting or attractive pursuits. This tendency can lead to some comical situations, but it can also make her a dangerous adversary if she decides to focus on a particular goal. DSC-MATE-3605 must be approached with a combination of caution and adaptability, as her whimsical nature makes her unpredictable in any situation.
