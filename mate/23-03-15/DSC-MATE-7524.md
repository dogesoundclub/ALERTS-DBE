ID # : DSC-MATE-7524
ITEM #: 7524

OBJECT CLASS: Safe

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: 

Subject 7524 is not to interact with any anomalous animals, objects, or persons not already pre-approved by Foundation personnel. They must also wear a medical mask at all times during any testing or interactions with personnel. All areas of interaction must be monitored by security cameras at all times. 

DESCRIPTION:

Subject 7524 is a human male with a distinctive dark spot on his mouth and a frightened expression on his face. His eyes are modified with VR rainbow LED technology, which is non-anomalous and does not interfere with his daily function. His head features short blonde hair and he often wears a gold chain. 

Subject 7524 works as a veterinarian, specializing in anomalous animal care. Despite his fears, he has a thirst for knowledge that often leads him down paths of obscure topics and research beyond his professional duties. In his free time, he collects books, documentaries, and other educational materials and shares his newfound knowledge with others. 

However, due to his exposure to anomalous creatures, subject 7524 has developed a cautious and paranoid personality. The medical mask he wears is not only for biosecurity reasons but also serves to keep him distanced from the animals he cares for. 

ADDENDUM:

Subject 7524 reported an incident in which he was exposed to an anomalous virus while treating a creature in his care. Although the virus was contained and eliminated, subject 7524 developed an extreme fear of contamination and the possibility of re-infection. Foundation personnel are advised to handle subject 7524 with caution and sensitivity to his mental health.
