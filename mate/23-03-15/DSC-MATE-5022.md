ID # : DSC-MATE-5022
DSC-MATE-5022 is a zoological anomaly that takes on the form of a monkey, specifically a baboon. This entity stands at approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighs roughly 60 kilograms. DSC-MATE-5022's most distinctive feature is its ski-goggle eyes, through which it can see in a broad range of spectrums.

DSC-MATE-5022â€™s head is parted and has a bright pink coat of fur, which is said to exude a faint pink mist. It is not known what triggers the emission of this mist or whether it has any anomalous properties.

On many occasions, DSC-MATE-5022 has been spotted by civilians on duty as a traffic officer, sometimes wearing a reflective vest and using its unique features to control and monitor traffic flow. The Foundation has attempted to curtail such operations, but DSC-MATE-5022 seems to pick its own assignments, often going on unsanctioned missions to prevent accidents or infractions.

Though DSC-MATE-5022's sense of humor may not be anomalous, it stands out as an interesting personality trait. It enjoys making others laugh and causing humorous situations. This can be attributed to its baboon nature, but it is uncertain whether this trait has any other motivations besides just spreading some joviality. One such example is the use of silly impersonations or telling humorous stories, often in the most unlikely places.

DSC-MATE-5022 always carries a cigarette in its hand, but doesn't seem to smoke it regularly. It is not known if this is purely a decorative item or if it holds some sentimental or ritual value to DSC-MATE-5022.
