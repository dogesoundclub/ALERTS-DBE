ID # : DSC-MATE-1311
Item #: 1311

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1311 is to be held in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the chamber should be restricted to authorized personnel only. All interactions with 1311 should be conducted from behind a closed, reinforced barrier.

Description:

1311 appears to be a human male, with orange stripes on their face and a short peak cap on their head. Their eyes are obscured by ski goggles, making it difficult to discern their true eye color. They wear green cross earrings and a silver chain necklace. The subject is rarely seen without a normal gas mask.

Personality-wise, 1311 seems to possess a natural charisma that tends to draw people towards them. They are known for their witty humor and affinity for silly dances. However, it is believed that this charismatic nature could be the result of a memetic effect. Therefore, direct contact with 1311 should be avoided at all costs.

Addendum:

Dr. ████ has recommended that testing be conducted to determine whether 1311’s appearance has an anomalous effect on human subjects. Approval pending.
