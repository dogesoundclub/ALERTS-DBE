DSC-MATE-1498, codenamed "The Jester," is a human male with a theatrical demeanor, tasked with managing a popular urban theatre. Despite his ordinary human appearance, The Jester possesses an extraordinary charm and charisma that make him the center of attention in any social gathering. His face boasts vibrant orange stripes that give him a distinct, mysterious appearance.

The Jester's eyes are covered by ski goggles, hiding any sign of emotion or reaction. His head is adorned with a bucket hat, which he never removes in public. He sports a green cross earring on his left ear and wears a medical mask over his mouth, making it difficult to read his expressions.

A silver chain draped around his neck is his only visible accessory, but it adds a touch of elegance to his ensemble. The Jester's outgoing personality and witty humor draw people in, often leading to entertaining situations where he tells jokes and shows off his dance moves to make others laugh.

As The Jester navigates the theatrical world, DogeSoundClub researchers keep a close eye on him, observing how he uses his charm to manipulate individuals and groups. As long as he remains within the confines of the theatre, he is closely monitored and contained.
