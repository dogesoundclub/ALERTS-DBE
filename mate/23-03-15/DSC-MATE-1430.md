Subject 1430, categorized as a Human Security Guard, possesses a striking appearance. The subject finds herself underneath a purple cap, adorned with a headset, providing her with the necessary tools to be on high alert at all times. Her eyes, a peculiar shade of orange, are framed by an equally stunning eyebrow. However, the most notable feature is her infectious smile which glows with optimism and exuberance.

Subject 1430, despite being primarily human, has some peculiar traits manifesting themselves in a solitary red cross earring she bears. 

Her charismatic demeanour is said to be enigmatic and alluring where engaging in discourse with the said subject, evokes a sense of openness, and connection. The ability to forge deep relations with strangers, draw out life stories and inspire laughter with witty anecdotes is believed to be unparalleled in the organization.

While seemingly harmless and friendly, it would be hasty to discount the potential of Subject 1430 to perceive and uncover malevolent activities. Caution should be effectively exercised when dealing with this anomaly.
