ID # : DSC-MATE-3840
Subject designated as Identification number 3840 is a peculiar entity; a delivery driver droid classified as 'robot'. His physical appearance is quite eccentric, with a short peak cap adorning the cranial unit, a red cross earring on each auditory apparatus, and a medical mask over the oral processor as a protective measure. However, the most striking feature is the goggles affixed to the metallic forehead, which seems to serve no tangible purpose beyond decoration.

The ocular modules resemble typical nerd glasses, exhibiting a subtle tint, and further implying that the subject may have some appreciation for visual optics. Moreover, the addition of a gold chain as an accessory may serve to denote a degree of flamboyance.

The personality of 3840 is similarly offbeat, with a great sense of humor that manifests in various forms. The subject derives pleasure from entertaining individuals and can often be observed telling stories or doing impressions to lift the spirits of those around him. These humorous tendencies might be at odds with the efficiency required of a delivery driver, but it appears that his presence might reduce the tension of his surroundings, making this peculiar individual quite an asset in his assigned line of work.
