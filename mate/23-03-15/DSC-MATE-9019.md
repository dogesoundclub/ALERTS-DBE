ID # : DSC-MATE-9019
DSC-MATE-9019 is a unique specimen, possessing both the body of a majestic tiger and the mind of a human farmer. Despite his imposing appearance, DSC-MATE-9019 often displays a frightened mouth and relies heavily on his normal glasses to see clearly. His head is not arranged in a traditional manner, instead displaying a wild and unkempt green appearance.

DSC-MATE-9019 can be identified by the red scarf adorning his neck, which he wears with pride as a symbol of his individuality. This is consistent with his rebellious and fiercely independent personality, as he strongly resists authority and rules he deems unnecessary.

Researchers must exercise extra caution when handling DSC-MATE-9019, as his tiger instincts can override his human intellect, resulting in potentially dangerous situations. Despite this, DSC-MATE-9019 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, utilizing his farming knowledge and tiger senses to detect anomalies in the natural world.

As with all DSCs, strict containment protocols are in place to ensure the safety of DSC-MATE-9019 and those around him. Any attempts to release him into the wild or otherwise disrupt the Foundation's control over him will not be tolerated.
