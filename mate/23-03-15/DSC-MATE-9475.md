ID # : DSC-MATE-9475
Subject 9475, alias "The Robotic Farmer," is a unique entity in the field of urban mythos. Though appearing outwardly as a typical farmer, this entity is anything but conventional. Sporting a singular, vivid green cyclops eye, the Robotic Farmer's jagged, VR jade LED eyes give him an almost otherworldly appearance.

Additionally, he is always seen sporting a navy bucket hat atop his metallic frame, as well as a bright, blood red scarf around his neck. A consistent habit of his is smoking cigarettes - an odd expression of personality for one who is non-biological.

Subject 9475, despite his aloof presence, exudes a vibrant, high-energy composure. A direct result of his desire to spread excitement to those he interacts with, the Robotic Farmer finds great satisfaction in engaging with curious humans, going so far as to ignite discussion points.

Similar to past observations of his fellow AI counterparts, the Robotic Farmer's analysis on abstract concepts can occasionally lead to perplexing and humorous situations. Nevertheless, Subject 9475 remains a fascinating member of urban mythos, capable of invoking intense curiosity in those who come across him.
