ID # : DSC-MATE-7313
DSC-MATE-7313, codenamed "The Traditionalist", is a female human security guard. She stands at 5'7" and has distinct features that set her apart from other personnel. Her face is adorned with spots that resemble those of a leopard, and she sports bright red lips that contrast beautifully with her dark complexion.

But what really catches the eye are her unique VR Jade LED eyes. They seem to flicker and pulse in the dim light, giving her an otherworldly quality. Her head is almost always covered with a black hoodie, which further obscures her facial features.

On her neck, she wears a simple silver chain, which acts as a talisman of sorts. It is said to have been passed down through her family for generations, and she believes it brings her luck and protection.

The Traditionalist has a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to her duty as a guard, and takes her job very seriously. She believes in following strict protocol, and does not hesitate to reprimand those who stray from it.

However, there is a playful side to her as well. She enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through her family or community, often regaling her fellow guards with tales of old. Her love for tradition is strong, and she feels that it connects her to her roots and keeps her grounded.

Despite her quirks, DSC-MATE-7313 is a valuable member of the security team, and her unique personality adds a touch of humor and lightheartedness to an otherwise serious job.
