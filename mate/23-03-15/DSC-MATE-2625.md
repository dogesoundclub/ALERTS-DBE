ID # : DSC-MATE-2625
DSC-MATE-2625, also known as "The Clown Veterinarian" is a human male of unknown age, standing at 6 feet and weighing approximately 180 lbs. His most distinct feature is a grotesque clown mouth, accompanied by a pair of menacing red clown eyes that contrast sharply against his pale skin. Atop his head rests a single peak spike, the purpose of which is unclear.

Despite his unsettling appearance, 2625 is a licensed veterinarian and has been known to treat animals with the utmost care and respect. His proficiency is evident in his ability to heal even the most severe of injuries, but it is clear that his true passion lies in gift-giving.

2625 possesses an uncanny ability to pick out the perfect gift for any occasion, but his obsession with perfection has been noted as a potential concern. He has been known to spend countless hours agonizing over gift choices and can become quite agitated if he feels he has failed to meet his own high standards.

To aid in his gift-giving endeavors, 2625 often carries a large candy stick with him, which he will offer to those he deems worthy of his generosity. While there is no known correlation between the candy stick and his gift-giving prowess, it is believed to be a source of comfort for 2625.

It is unclear how or why 2625 acquired his unique appearance, but it is suspected that he may have undergone some form of anomalous transformation. His exact nature and capabilities are still currently under investigation by the DogeSoundClub.
