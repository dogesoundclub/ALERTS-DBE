ID # : DSC-MATE-5261
DSC-MATE-5261, also known as "The Jester", is a humanoid entity that has the appearance of a young female programmer. Its distinguishing feature is its crimson red clown-like eyes which are unnaturally bright and vivid, akin to the glowing embers of a raging inferno. DSC-MATE-5261's head is always adorned with a black hoodie, and its mouth is concealed by a medical mask to hide its true identity from onlookers.

Despite its off-putting appearance, DSC-MATE-5261 gives the impression of being laid-back and easy-going. However, it has been observed that it can be fiercely protective of its loved ones, who it holds in high esteem. This loyalty can manifest in a humorous yet dangerous way, such as engaging in arguments with anyone who disrespects or insults its family or close friends.

Under normal circumstances, DSC-MATE-5261 can communicate fluently and possesses a quick wit. It often indulges in harmless pranks to add levity to its daily routine. However, it has been noted that its mood can change rapidly, especially when its loved ones are in peril, and its demeanor can become starkly serious, with a willingness to use force if necessary.

Despite being a Humanoid entity, DSC-MATE-5261's reality-warping abilities are still under consideration. Further investigations are ongoing for the safety of the Foundation and the general public.
