Description:
Subject 5207 is a human female in her mid-20s. She stands at 5'4" and has blonde hair styled in an ushanka hat. Her face features orange stripes that appear to have been painted on. She wears a red cross earring on her left ear and a medical mask covers her mouth.

Subject 5207's personality is unique in that they exhibit a strong sense of care and nurture towards not only living beings, but inanimate objects as well. They have been known to give their car a name, talk to their plants, and even give personalities to household appliances. Due to her kind nature, she is highly regarded by her colleagues in the banking industry as a valuable and dedicated employee.

Addendum 5207-01:
Subject 5207 has shown an interest in the supernatural and often speaks in vague terms about her interactions with otherworldly entities. However, no conclusive evidence has been found to support these claims. Agents are advised to monitor her movements and communication channels for possible breaches of the Masquerade. 

It is likely that Subject 5207 will need to undergo amnestic treatment should any undue awareness of the supernatural be discovered.
