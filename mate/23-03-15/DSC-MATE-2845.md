Subject 2845, also known as Officer 2845, is a human female working in the field of law enforcement for the purposes of the urban fantasy containment protocol. With orange eyebrows and a short, witch-like hairstyle, 2845 is easily recognizable in both casual and professional environments. However, her most striking feature lies within her golden earrings and chain, which seem to glow with a subtle otherworldly energy.

Despite her intimidating appearance, 2845 often presents herself with a laid-back and easy-going demeanor. However, beneath this persona lies a fiercely protective and loyal individual with a strong sense of justice. Her loyalty often leads to comical situations, as she is not afraid to get into heated arguments with those who insult her friends or family.

Despite her protective nature, Officer 2845 remains a valuable asset to the urban fantasy containment team; her LED gas mask is an especially invaluable tool in environments with hazardous substances or anomalous particles. She is a formidable ally and a formidable foe, able to take on any challenge that comes her way with ease and grace.
