ID # : DSC-MATE-3794
Subject 3794 is a peculiar specimen, appearing like an amalgamation of cyber and natural elements. The female programmer strikes at first glance with her striking orange stripes on her face that contrast against her violet lips, almost appearing like neon graffiti on her human canvas. Her eyes are nothing short of a technological marvel, looped with a VR rainbow LED that emits a soft aura that seems to come straight out of a futuristic flick. Strapped across her forehead is a tiara adorned with emeralds and amethysts, further adding an air of otherworldliness to her being. The green cross earring on her ear screams avant-garde, depicting that she is no ordinary human.

Subject 3794 is a compassionate individual, possessing a deep empathy for all around her. However, her altruistic nature can lead her to take up other's issues as her own, feeling personally responsible for their well-being. She utilizes her programming acumen to help others, often going above and beyond, exhausting herself while solving complex problems that plague her peers. Her ever-present medical mask, though, hints at a larger purpose her empathic nature serves, alluding to a hidden reason for the strange mix of metal and biology in her appearance.

Subject 3794 is a rare find, a gem in a world full of dust, a concoction of technology and humanity, a true wonder to behold. One can't help but wonder what transcendent qualities lay hidden beneath the surface of this fascinating individual.
