ID # : DSC-MATE-5318
Item #: 5318

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Individual identified as 5318, also known as "The Beautician", is to be monitored and kept under surveillance at all times. Personnel interacting with the subject must wear full protective gear, including masks, to prevent any possible exposure to potentially contagious airborne particles. The subject has to be kept away from any sharp objects or anything that can be used as a weapon.

Description:
Subject 5318 is a female human with an unusual appearance. She has spots covering her face, highlighted by her red lips, and peculiar blue clownish eyes. Her hair is blonde, resembling a delicate feathered wing, and she wears a Red Cross earring in each ear. The subject wears a medical mask due to the constant presence of a persistent coughing.

Despite her diminutive stature, the subject appears to be physically strong and agile. She wears a silver chain around her neck, which she fidgets with continuously.

The subject has an independent personality that can come across as rebellious. Though she maintains a career as a beautician, she is often tempted to sneak out of her job or take a day off without notice. She tends to question authority, and may even challenge those in charge if she deems it necessary.

There is a possibility that the subject may exhibit paranormal abilities since she has displayed control over particle movements by utilizing her coughing. However, lack of evidence that supports or refutes this claim leaves the subject's abilities uncertain. 

Addendum:
It has been observed that the subject's coughing fits are increasing in frequency and duration, but the cause is unknown. All personnel should remain alert and take caution in the presence of 5318.
