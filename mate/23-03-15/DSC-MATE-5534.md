**Item #:** 5534

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item 5534 is to be kept in a secure location within a designated containment chamber at all times. Access to the chamber is restricted to authorized personnel only. The room must be fitted with a temperature-controlled system to prevent damage to the item. Additionally, Item 5534 is to be monitored by a remote surveillance system 24/7.

**Description:** Item 5534 is an anomalous human male designated as a 'Banker'. The subject's face bears two distinguishable features - a dark spot above the mouth and an expression of fear around the mouth. The subject also wears prescription nerd glasses and has a unique two-color band on the forehead. A Jade earring can be observed on both ears, and a medical mask always covers the mouth area. The subject is often seen wearing a red scarf as an accessory.

Despite the subject's obvious peculiarities, Item 5534's primary ability is their social prowess. They have a rare talent for attracting attention and making people laugh uncontrollably with their jokes and stories. This trait can make the subject quite useful for high profile social events or as a distraction during delicate missions. However, Item 5534 should be monitored carefully as prolonged exposure to this ability can lead to undue attention and interference with ongoing operations.

**Addendum:** A recent incident involving Item 5534 resulted in an accidental discharge of its social ability, which resulted in widespread laughter and chaos. As such, caution is advised when in close contact with the subject or during attempts to run any tests with the Item.
