ID # : DSC-MATE-3978
Item #: 3978

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 3978 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. Any sign of aberrant behavior is to be reported to Dr. ██████ immediately. The subject is to be supplied with daily doses of class-B amnestics to prevent the development of memories that could cause disturbances in our current reality. All deliveries made by 3978 are to be tracked and monitored for any unusual manifestation of his abilities.

Description:

Subject 3978 is a delivery driver, employed by a local courier company. They are a human male, with green layers on the top of their head, gold earring earpieces, and a gold chain around the neck. The subject's most notable feature is their constant smile.

3978's primary ability is empathy, a power that allows them to perceive and share the emotions of others. This sensitivity often leads them to take on the problems of those around them, feeling responsible for resolving any personal conflicts they encounter. While this ability to care deeply for others is admirable, it can also be exhausting and potentially dangerous.

The subject has shown the ability to enhance and boost the emotions of those around them, as well as develop a telepathic connection with those they bond with emotionally. The range and duration of these abilities are still under observation.

Addendum:

After a recent incident where Subject 3978 was exposed to an unknown reality-warping agent, they exhibited previously unknown abilities. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of these abilities, as well as the source of the agent. Security protocols are to be increased in the immediate area of the subject, while we work to uncover the origin of this new anomaly.
