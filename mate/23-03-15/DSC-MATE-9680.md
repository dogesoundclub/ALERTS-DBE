Subject 9680 is a peculiar specimen of the human species, occupying the position of a news anchor. The subject's most striking features include a pair of red clown eyes, reminiscent of some form of otherworldly energy. The subject's blonde crown is adorned with an impressive wing, most likely as a symbol of their importance. Their lips, with an almost unnatural purple hue, appear to possess some form of hypnotic quality.

This individual has a tendency to show abnormal nurturing and caring traits towards others, often taking care of their acquaintances as if they were their own flesh and blood. This trait has led to a seemingly paradoxical situation, where the subject, despite their strange characteristic features, repeatedly appears warm and approachable to those around them.

Such a combination of traits makes Subject 9680 a fascinating specimen to study, as long as care is taken when handling them. It is recommended to approach this individual with caution, as they possess a certain unpredictability that may prove hazardous to those unprepared. Additionally, it is worth noting that the subject possesses an LED gas mask that may offer some form of protection against external influences, albeit at an unknown cost.
