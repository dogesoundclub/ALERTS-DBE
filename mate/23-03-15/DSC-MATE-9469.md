ID # : DSC-MATE-9469
DSC-MATE-9469, also known as "The Gift Master," is a young human female with prominent spots on her face and an infectious smile that can warm even the coldest hearts. Her pigtail hairstyle adds to her youthfulness, but don't let this fool you - she possesses an uncanny ability to observe even the smallest details, making her an asset for any job requiring attention to detail, such as her current position as a fast food worker.

Her forehead is adorned with a distinctive 2 color band, a mark of unknown origin that seems to have no effect on her abilities. However, what truly sets her apart are her red cross earrings, which seem to give her a sense of purpose or belonging.

Despite her charming appearance, DSC-MATE-9469 comes with a catch. Her gift-giving nature can be obsessive, causing her to spend an excessive amount of time and resources searching for the perfect gift. In some cases, this can even lead to impulsive behavior or poor judgment.

The Foundation is currently monitoring DSC-MATE-9469, and while her anomalous abilities have not yet posed any severe threats, her unpredictable nature could prove to be a wildcard in the future. Until then, we will continue to study and document her behavior to ensure the safety of all involved parties.
