Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 6098 is to be kept under observation and restrained at all times within a secured containment unit. Access to the subject is restricted to authorized personnel only. Any communication attempts from the subject are to be recorded and monitored for research purposes.

Description:

Subject 6098 is a female human with orange stripes on her face and purple lips. The subject's eyes emit a vivid VR Jade LED glow. The head is often covered by a hoodie, and the mouth is consistently concealed by a medical mask. The subject goes by the name "Farmer" and maintains a quiet and reserved demeanor when there is no significant stimulus to trigger her personality quirks.

6098 possesses an idealistic personality that frequently leads to her championing for social and political justice.  She is impassioned by causing her way to make the world a better place, and this sometimes leads her to participate in protests or boycotts against organizations and causes that she deems unethical. In extreme cases, she may advocate for the use of force to attain her goals.

The reasoning behind subject 6098's physical features remains unknown, and attempts at its removal have proven fruitless. Research is ongoing to determine its relationship to the subject's anomalous traits. Despite confinement, the subject shows no signs of physical or psychological impairment.

Addendum:

Subject 6098 is being deemed a possible candidate for the Foundation's Thaumiel Program due to her 'Make the world better' goals aligning with that of the Foundation. A proposal is being drafted to induce 6098 into the program after further analysis of its anomalous traits.
