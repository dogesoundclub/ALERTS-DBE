Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-6502 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber modified to accommodate a tiger's physical needs. Due to DSC-MATE-6502's occupation as a farmer, it is permitted to have access to the outside world to tend to its crops and livestock. Any and all communication with DSC-MATE-6502 must be done through written correspondence or audio equipment due to its protective LED gas mask.

Description:

DSC-MATE-6502, also known as "The Knowledge Farmer," is a male Bengal tiger standing approximately 2 meters in length. The creature possesses an unusual headwear piece in the form of a police cap adorned with a matching goggle over its forehead. It has sharp eyesight with a jade earring on each of its ears. However, the eyesight of DSC-MATE-6502 remains a mystery as it is perpetually covered by its LED gas mask.

DSC-MATE-6502 has an insatiable thirst for knowledge, spending most of its time poring through books, documentaries, and other educational materials. It is an avid collector, stocking up on new and obscure topics to satisfy its intellectual curiosity. DSC-MATE-6502 also delights in sharing its newfound knowledge with others, including its captors.

DSC-MATE-6502's farming skills are exemplary, harvesting crops, and rearing livestock efficiently. Its farming equipment has been mysteriously modified with unexplainable and highly-efficient mechanisms. Attempts to replicate the technology have been unsuccessful.

DSC-MATE-6502 possesses great strength that can overload standard containment measures, and its inquisitive nature prompts it to investigate new environments outside of its confinement.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-6502 has expressed a desire to communicate via audio equipment. The request has been granted, provided that it wears its gas mask during any interaction. DSC-MATE-6502 has proven to be cooperative and has shown no sign of aggression towards staff. However, it remains acutely aware of its captivity and the limitations that come with it.
