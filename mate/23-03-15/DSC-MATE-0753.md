ID # : DSC-MATE-753
DSC-MATE-753, known by her colleagues as "Bugs Bunny," is a fast food worker of the human variety. Ehâ€¦ what's up, Doc? Ain't she a sight to see with her pink rabbit head and green cross earring. It appears DSC-MATE-753 has a penchant for the cancer-stick as well, spending her off hours puffing on a cigarette. 

While not a typical DSC, this humanoid creature's jovial personality and goofy nature make her a valuable addition to the community. They highly prize social connections and thrive off engagements with others. By engaging in playful banter with her coworkers and customers alike, she holds herself with a joyful spirit that is hard to ignore. 

On the other hand, should her harmony be disrupted, her pleasant disposition can sour quickly. Those who cross her or her friends better watch their backs - this bunny doesn't mess around. So next time you're munching on a burger and see Bugs Bunny behind the counter, know that you're in good hands. Just don't make her mad, Doc.
