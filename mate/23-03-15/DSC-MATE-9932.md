ID # : DSC-MATE-9932
Item #: 9932

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures:

9932 is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times. Any attempts to leave Foundation custody must be immediately reported and prevented. 9932 may be granted access to medical equipment and technology as long as it is supervised by Foundation personnel.

Description:

9932 is a human female, with distinctive spotted skin that covers their face and body. Their eyes are obscured by standard prescription glasses, which appear to hide something unusual about their gaze. 9932 often wears a bucket hat atop their head, and has a pair of goggles propped up on their forehead. They have a red cross earring on their left earlobe, and a silver chain around their neck.

The most perplexing aspect of 9932's appearance is their LED gas mask, which glows in various hues for unknown reasons. 9932 has not revealed the mask's purpose, nor why they constantly wear it, despite its lack of practical use.

9932 is independent and self-reliant, often refusing help when it is offered. They display a stubborn streak, preferring to tackle problems on their own, even to their detriment. This has led to minor mishaps in their time under Foundation care, such as attempting to move heavy objects without assistance and refusing to follow a map when lost.

Addendum:

9932 has demonstrated medical knowledge and has the potential to be a valuable asset to the Foundation's research and containment efforts. However, their resistance to aid, combined with their unusual mask, make them a high-risk object and require close monitoring.
