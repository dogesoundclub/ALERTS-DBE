Item #: 4845

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4845 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber, designed to resemble a police station. The chamber is to be equipped with security personnel, armed with tranquilizer guns, in case of a security breach. The subject requires a daily diet of fruits and vegetables and is to be monitored by a medical team for any physical or mental changes.

Description:

Subject 4845 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 2 feet tall when upright on his hind legs. The most distinctive feature of the subject is his blue clown eyes - a mutation that is believed to have been caused by contact with an unknown magical element. He wears a police cap atop his head and carries a silver chain and whistle as accessories. Anxious by nature, the subject is observed to have a perpetually scared expression on his face, with his frightened mouth being another standout feature. 

Personality:

Susceptible to being naive and quick to trust others, 4845 tends to act before he thinks things through. He can be a reckless individual, which can lead to him getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to show off or impress others. Despite his tendency towards impulsivity, he is incredibly dedicated to his job as a security guard at the containment facility. His quirky personality has endeared him to the other staff who often take breaks to play games and joke around with him.

Addendum:

Subject 4845 has been reported to exhibit a considerable amount of magical potential. This manifests in the form of objects within his line of sight to momentarily float or move at his will. Additional testing has been recommended to better understand this ability - its strength, range, and potential for misuse.
