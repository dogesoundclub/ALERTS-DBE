ID # : DSC-MATE-1168
██████, designated as ID #1168, is a notorious villain with a humanoid form. Despite being a human, he's not your average criminal. He has a peculiar appearance that immediately draws attention to him. The most striking thing about ID #1168 is his bright orange stripes that adorn his skin, giving him a distinct look that is almost hypnotizing.

However, it's not just his stripes that make him memorable. He has piercing blue clown eyes that seem to stare straight into your soul. His head is topped with a peak spike that gives him an almost devilish appearance, further emphasized by his gold earring.

In his hand, he limply holds a candy stick, which seems out of place given his villainous nature. But ID #1168 isn't just unique because of his appearance.

Despite his criminal background, he has a scatterbrained personality that can cause him to forget crucial things, or even wander off while in the middle of a crime. This can lead to some humorous and unexpected situations that have thrown off even the most seasoned heroes in the urban fantasy world.

As such, approach with caution when dealing with ID #1168. Though he may appear disoriented and disconnected, it's all part of his cunning plan to lure his enemies into a sense of false security. The last thing you'd want to do is let your guard down around this peculiar villain.
