ID # : DSC-MATE-4867
DSC-MATE-4867, also known as "Rabbit Farmer," is a humanoid female of the human species, with an anomalous appearance that includes a pink rabbit head and gold earrings for ears. DSC-MATE-4867's most notable physical feature is her permanent smile, complemented by a choker that they always wear around her neck.

DSC-MATE-4867's personality is bubbly and upbeat, but their scatterbrained tendencies can cause disruptions when completing tasks or keeping schedules. Despite this, DSC-MATE-4867's skill and dedication as a farmer is undeniable, and their focus is unwavering when it comes to managing their crops and livestock within the DogeSoundClub's containment facilities.

Attempts to remove the rabbit head and earring accessories have been unsuccessful, indicating that these features are integral to DSC-MATE-4867's anomalous properties. As such, personnel are advised to maintain a professional, non-judgmental attitude towards DSC-MATE-4867, treating them with the same respect as any other Foundation staff member.
