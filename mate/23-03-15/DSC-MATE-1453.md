ID # : DSC-MATE-1453
DSC-MATE-1453, also known as "The Banker," is a human male with striking orange stripes on his otherwise pale face. His expression is one of constant fear, with a pinched and trembling mouth that suggests he is perpetually on the verge of screaming. But what is truly unusual about DSC-MATE-1453 is the layered, green texture of his head, as if his scalp were made of overlapping leaves or scales. His ears, meanwhile, are adorned with a single gold earring, a seemingly incongruous piece of jewelry for such an anxious and peculiar individual. 

However, the most notable item that DSC-MATE-1453 wears is a LED gas mask that he always carries with him, even when not performing any duties that would require it. The mask appears to be a customized version of the World War I-era gas mask, outfitted with a glowing light at the center and multiple filters, constantly whirring and clicking in the background. Whether this gas mask serves any practical purpose or is merely a personal affectation is still unknown. 

DSC-MATE-1453's personality is marked by an intense sensitivity to emotions and artistic stimuli. He has been seen openly weeping during sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, and has even been caught humming or singing along with music when he thinks no one is watching. It is possible that the LED gas mask is a way for him to control or block out overwhelming emotions, although this theory has not been confirmed. DSC-MATE-1453 may be suitable for certain tasks that require empathy or emotional intelligence, but his extreme phobias and unusual physical features make him a challenging candidate for most field work.
