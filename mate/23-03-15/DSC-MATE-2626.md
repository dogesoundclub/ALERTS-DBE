Subject 2626 is to be kept under close observation at all times. He appears to be a male rabbit, but his behavior betrays him as something more than just a mere animal. As a real estate agent, 2626 possesses a charismatic charm and is able to easily sway his clients into buying luxurious properties they might not even be able to afford. He is a master at his craft, and is able to effortlessly use his artistic nature to charm and persuade.

Despite his outward confidence, however, subject 2626 often displays signs of anxiety and fear, as shown by his frightened mouth. This could be due to his inherent status as a prey animal, or perhaps something more sinister is at work within his mind.

2626's eyes are hidden behind a pair of nerd glasses, which help him to focus and analyze every aspect of a potential sale or deal. His head is topped with a police cap, hinting at a possible past career in law enforcement, while a single gold earring adorns one of his ears, further adding to his already eccentric appearance.

When not busy with real estate deals or negotiations, subject 2626 can often be seen with a candy stick in his hand, a reminder of his more innocent and carefree side. Despite his sometimes shady dealings, his creative and artistic nature shines through in his hobbies such as painting, drawing, or writing.

Approach subject 2626 with caution, for beneath his charming exterior lies more than just a mere rabbit. His true intentions and motivations remain a mystery, and it is only through close observation and study that we may begin to unravel the secrets that he harbors.
