ID # : DSC-MATE-6928
Subject 6928 is an enigmatic lawyer working within the depths of the legal system. His appearance is unsettling at best, with a prominent mouth spot and a twisted clown mouth. His red clown eyes stare out from behind a medical mask and a jade earring hangs from one ear. 

However, it is not his appearance that sets him apart from his peers, but rather his psychic abilities. Subject 6928 possesses a powerful intuition that allows him to sense emotions and predict events before they occur. It is rumored that he can read minds and manipulate reality with nothing more than a thought. 

Those who have crossed his path speak of an eerie feeling that lingers in his presence, as if he knows something they do not. His clients swear by his ability to win cases before they even go to trial, while his opponents shake in fear at the mere mention of his name. 

Subject 6928 may appear to be a mere human on the surface, but his eerie abilities suggest something more supernatural lying beneath the surface. Approach with caution.
