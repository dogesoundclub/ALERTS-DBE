DogeSoundClub Description - Containment Procedure Update:

Designation: DSC-MATE-437

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-437 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with all necessary amenities for a primate species. During any interaction, personnel must use gloves and face shields to protect themselves from any potential harm caused by DSC-MATE-437. Access to DSC-MATE-437 is limited to a Level 3 clearance or above.

Description:

DSC-MATE-437 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.5 meters tall. Its eyes are covered with ski goggles, while its head is adorned with a doge hat. DSC-MATE-437 wears a red scarf and a gold earring. It also carries a lit cigarette in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-437 has exhibited a unique personality, characterized by its ambitious and goal-oriented nature. It tends to take on more than it can handle, but its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills allow it to pull off its tasks successfully. DSC-MATE-437 is highly intelligent and can communicate using sign language and gestures.

DSC-MATE-437 has recently revealed that it works as a reporter for an unknown organization. The Foundation is currently investigating this claim to ensure that its actions do not pose a threat to its containment. However, DSC-MATE-437 has shown some resistance towards providing any further information about its job or organization.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-437 has been found to possess anomalous abilities. It can bend the space-time continuum and create portals to different dimensions, as observed during a containment breach on [REDACTED]. Further research is required to understand the full extent of DSC-MATE-437's abilities and limitations.

DogeSoundClub researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of utilizing DSC-MATE-437's abilities to assist in interdimensional travel or communication. However, caution must be exercised, as DSC-MATE-437's cooperation may need convincing.
