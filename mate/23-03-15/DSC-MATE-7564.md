DSC Identification number 7564, also known as "The Anchor," is a female human with striking features that cannot go unnoticed. Her face is adorned with orange stripes, and her lips are a bold shade of purple. She has a sophisticated air about her, enhanced by her normal glasses, which she wears with pride. Her head is a shimmering metallic blue, and her green cross earring is an intriguing addition to her appearance.

With the power of her voice and her unflinching determination, she can make you believe anything. 

Approach with caution, for The Anchor is not just a mere news anchor. She is a living symbol of the power of the media and the strength of the human spirit.
