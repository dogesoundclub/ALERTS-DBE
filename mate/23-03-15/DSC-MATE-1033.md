ID # : DSC-MATE-1033
Subject 1033 is a police officer, however, their appearance is quite extraordinary. Their species is that of a tiger and despite their rather unusual appearance in a world filled with humans, they are quite adept at blending in.

His eyes are adorned with horned rim glasses that sit atop his snout. His head is covered in a shock of green hair that is kept neatly under a purple cap. Upon further inspection, you will notice a two-color band situated on his forehead.

Their attire is completed by a gleaming gold chain around their neck, adding to their already mystifying appearance.

When it comes to their personality, subject 1033 is a true adventurer. They have a love for taking risks and trying new things, which makes for some very amusing stories. For instance, stories of being stranded after a failed bungee jump, or getting lost during a wilderness expedition.

Although this subject may seem out of place in a society of humans, their adventurous spirit and determination to succeed make them an asset to their team.
