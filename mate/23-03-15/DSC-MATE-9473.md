DSC-MATE-9473, codenamed "The Rabbit," is a real estate agent of unknown origin who possesses an unusual appearance. It possesses a head resembling that of a pink rabbit, complete with long ears tipped with jade earrings, and bright orange eyebrows above its beady eyes. However, its mouth is consistently covered with a medical mask, hiding its true visage from prying eyes.

Despite its peculiar appearance, The Rabbit is a consummate professional, using its skills to sell properties to both humans and anomalous entities alike. However, its obsessive attention to detail can manifest in unexpected ways, often leading to a quirkiness that belies its otherwise serious demeanor. Whether it's alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet, The Rabbit's attention to minutiae is a defining feature of its personality.

The Rabbit is known to wear a silver chain around its neck, which is rumored to possess anomalous properties. Its origins and motivations remain unknown, leading some agents to speculate that it may be a runaway experiment from an unknown organization. However, despite its enigmatic nature, The Rabbit is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation, providing a unique perspective on the world of real estate and beyond.
