DogeSoundClub Containment Report: Humanoid Entity, Designation 235

Subject 235 is known to the public as an electrician, operating under a pseudonym to protect its true identity. Physical examination has revealed that the subject is, in fact, a human male, but with an abnormal appearance that defies explanation. Its head is entirely composed of purple-colored metal, while its eyes resemble those of a clown, sporting a bright blue hue that seems to glow in low-light conditions. The subject also wears a gold earring and a red scarf, as well as being frequently seen with a candy stick in its mouth.

Subject 235 is classified as Euclid due to its anomalous nature and behavior. Its personality is characterized by a strong idealism, an admirable trait but one that brings about concerns for its ability to maintain its own containment. The subject has shown a desire to make the world a better place, but their approach to this is often unconventional or misguided. Urban legends suggest that the entity has been seen protesting or boycotting companies or causes that conflict with its perceived values, even when this puts the subject at risk.

Containment protocols for subject 235 are strict; it must be confined to a single room at all times, with only a small window for observation. Its room is fitted with electrical monitoring equipment, as the subject has shown a tendency to tamper with electronic devices in the past. Additionally, all staff must be thoroughly vetted for any potential biases or beliefs to prevent any undue influence.

The subject is also to be monitored for any attempts to communicate with parties external to the Foundation. While it is unlikely that the entity would intentionally cause harm, its presence is a significant anomaly that could draw unwanted attention to the Foundation's activities.

Overall, subject 235 remains a curious enigma with a desire to make the world a better place, but this desire coupled with an anomalous ability raises concerns for both the subject and the public's safety. All personnel are reminded that containment must be maintained at all times.
