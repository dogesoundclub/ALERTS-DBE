ID # : DSC-MATE-1008
DSC-MATE-1008 is a human male, identified as a police officer with unusual physical features. Notably, he has spots on his face and wears nerd glasses that draw attention to his eyes. His head is always covered in a purple cap with a headset, and he sports a goggle on his forehead that serves an unknown purpose. The absence of any significant behavioral deviations from his species, marked by a tendency to get lost in thought and forget appointments, makes him a low-priority but peculiar case for the Foundation.

DSC-MATE-1008's forgetfulness is often endearing and even humorous, though it presents logistical complications. On several occasions, he has lost track of time and missed important events, highlighting the need for close supervision. However, his charm has proven useful in social situations, especially when engaging with cooperative subjects. The Foundation continues to monitor DSC-MATE-1008 and will update intelligence as necessary to assess DSC-MATE-1008's capabilities.
