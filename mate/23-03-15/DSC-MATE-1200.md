Subject #1200, codenamed "the Spontaneity-Snuffer," is a human male with distinct facial spots and unnerving blue clown eyes. His head is always adorned with a fierce bucket hat, and his ears bear a single shining jade earring. This subject tends to conceal his mouth with a medical mask, adding to his inscrutable and mysterious allure.

As a former beautician, his outward appearance is meticulously honed to the finest detail. However, his demeanor is far less pliant - this subject has a stubborn streak that manifests in amusing ways, particularly when confronted with unfamiliar situations or ideas. Though he may be somewhat rigid in his routines, he is nonetheless dependable and organized.

In the realm of the paranormal, Subject #1200 is somewhat of an enigma. Though his species is ostensibly human, his eccentric appearance suggests otherwise. And yet, his innate eccentricity may prove to be a valuable asset in navigating the unpredictable and often dangerous mysteries of the supernatural world.

Nonetheless, caution must be exercised when interacting with Subject #1200. His unrevealed motivations and methods are likely to surprise even those most familiar with his idiosyncrasies, and it is suspected that he harbors hidden secrets that could prove disastrous in the wrong hands.

Until further investigation provides clarification, Subject #1200 is to be treated with the utmost care and attention. Do not permit him to sniff out your spontaneity, lest he choose to snuff it out completely.
