Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-7681 is to be kept in a humanoid containment chamber equipped with sound-absorbing materials to reduce the risk of accidental acoustic repetition of DSC-MATE-7681’s vocalizations. DSC-MATE-7681 is permitted one hour of supervised exercise per day, but all other interaction with DSC-MATE-7681 must be conducted remotely via intercom. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-7681 to spread its ideology or boycott items will be met with disciplinary action. DSC-MATE-7681 is required to wear its medical mask at all times to prevent potential anomalous spread.

Description:
DSC-MATE-7681 is a human male in his late twenties, standing at 1.75 meters tall and weighing 68 kg. DSC-MATE-7681's most notable facial features are a circular spot on the left side of its mouth and a scar-like texture around its mouth, giving the appearance that DSC-MATE-7681 is constantly frightened. DSC-MATE-7681 has red clown eyes and wears a green cross-shaped earring. DSC-MATE-7681 frequently accessorizes with a gold chain.

DSC-MATE-7681 is a fashion designer by profession, and has a strong sense of idealism, believing that it is their duty to save the world. This leads to DSC-MATE-7681 actively boycotting and protesting against businesses or organizations that it views as going against its personal values. DSC-MATE-7681's vocalizations are amplified and plagued with reverb, producing an unsettling effect on its audience.

DSC-MATE-7681's anomalous properties manifest when individuals come into contact with it for over an extended period. These individuals begin to exhibit a particular desire to protest against or boycott particular organizations, often without a clear understanding of why. Individuals affected show an apparent connection to DSC-MATE-7681's ideologies and may seek out others to spread its beliefs, even if this behavior goes against their regular personality.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-7681’s current containment was initiated after an incident in which it inspired six entire cities to boycott a particular supermarket chain without any comprehensible justification for the movement. It took the Foundation over ten months to kill the boycott movement entirely as individuals continued impassioned protests against the chain. DSC-MATE-7681's containment has prevented further instances of anomalous movements.
