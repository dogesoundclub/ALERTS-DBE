ID # : DSC-MATE-1824
DSC-MATE-1824, also known as "The Clown Lawyer", is a peculiar human male of unknown origin that was discovered by our agents in the heart of the city. The subject is distinguishable by his most noticeable feature, a black spot that covers the left side of his mouth, which seems to be unaffected by any attempts to remove it. Furthermore, he constantly displays an expression of stark terror, as if he is in a perpetual state of fear, constantly lingering over something that cannot be seen.

The subject has red clown eyes that constantly exude an eerie glow, which may suggest some form of supernatural or anomalous ability. Scans have indicated that the subject's head has been partially replaced by an unknown metal, which makes the subject highly resistant to physical damage.

The subject also has a large green-cross earring that appears to have no apparent function other than aesthetics, as well as a gold chain for a necklace. The significance of these accessories is currently unknown.

Despite his unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-1824 is a highly analytical and intelligent individual, possessing exceptional leadership skills that often lead him to take charge of situations, whether it be within his career as a lawyer, in social groups or in his personal life. It is unknown whether this is a genuine personality trait or some form of effect caused by the subject's anomalous characteristics. Further research into his background and behavior is required.
