ID # : DSC-MATE-647
DSC-MATE-647 is a female electrician who has been under Foundation surveillance due to her unique appearance and behavior. She is often seen wearing a bucket hat to protect her from electric shocks during her work, and normal glasses that seem to enhance her sight. Her most striking feature is the red-cross earring in her left ear, believed to be linked to some anomalous abilities, although further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

DSC-MATE-647 also seems to have a fascination with accessories and is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck, which appears to be of no anomalous significance. However, it is her LED gas mask that is the most curious of her accessories. The mask, when activated, emits a bright blue light that seems to have a calming effect on DSC-MATE-647, but can also be blinding to those around her.

DSC-MATE-647's personality is that of a gifted individual with attention to detail. This talent often manifests in her gift-giving abilities as she can read between the lines to choose the perfect present for someone. Unfortunately, this same talent can also be a curse as DSC-MATE-647 can become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and spend excessive amounts of time agonizing over what to get someone.

Further observation is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-647's anomalous abilities, as well as any potential drawbacks they may pose. Until then, the Foundation will closely monitor her activities and report any further developments.
