ID # : DSC-MATE-5764
Item #: 5764

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

5764 is to be kept in a standard containment cell at Site-██. The cell is to be furnished in a manner suitable for a Tiger’s comfort, with plenty of space for them to roam around. Any lure-like objects are to be removed from the cell to minimize the risk of impulsive behavior by the creature.

Due to 5764’s unpredictable nature, all personnel coming into contact with the entity must undergo a psychological evaluation beforehand for their own safety.

Description:

5764 is a male Tiger with a bright and colorful set of Rainbow LED eyes. Their excessively frightened mouth only adds to their already intimidating appearance.

The entity wears a red cross-shaped earring on their left ear, tied together with a silver chain which hangs around their neck. Occasionally, it is seen playing with a candy stick, which it is believed is used as a stress reliever.

5764 possesses an unpredictable personality making it difficult to anticipate its actions. They thrive on spontaneity and are known to jump off cliffs, swim in lakes or rivers, and take other risks on a whim.

Despite their unpredictable behavior, 5764 has shown no malicious intentions and has even been known to play tricks on personnel, such as hiding items or leaving false trails.

Addendum:

Recently, 5764 has shown increased aggression towards its caretakers, snarling at them when they attempt to remove or relocate its toys. It is unclear whether this is due to the presence of a particular stimulus, or if it is part of a longer-term behavioral change in the entity. Research is ongoing.
