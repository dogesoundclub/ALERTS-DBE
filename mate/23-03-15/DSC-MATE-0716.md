ID # : DSC-MATE-716
Subject 716 is a Human female who goes by the name of "The Banker." Her appearance is quite unique; she has pale skin covered in spots, which is quite the contrast to her beaming smile. Her VR Rainbow LED eyes are sure to catch anyone's attention, but her Bucket Hat and Red Cross Earring make it clear that she does not like to be the center of attention. Further, she keeps her medical mask on at all times, perhaps to hide her pearly whites, or maybe to protect herself from airborne contaminants.

The Banker fancies a Gold Chain around her neck, and it dangles like a bright reminder of her wealth. But do not be fooled, The Banker is quite scatterbrained, and her forgotten appointments can lead to laugh-out-loud moments. While trying to find new places, it is easy for her to get sidetracked, and that can make her late or lost. 

However, do not underestimate The Banker because of her forgetfulness. She is sharp, always calculating numbers and double-checking bank statements. She has a soft heart for those in need, and her altruistic nature makes sure that she helps the less fortunate when she can. The Banker is a vital asset to the DSC foundation and her job as a Banker, making sure DSC agents receive their paychecks on time. With her VR Rainbow LED eyes, she sees the value in every person and ensures their worth is accounted for.
