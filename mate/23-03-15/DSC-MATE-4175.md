Subject 4175, codenamed "The Jester," is a humanoid Traffic Officer with unique facial features. The subject is male in gender and possesses a distinct mouth spot on his face. When not on duty, 4175 is known to wear a retro cap and a jade earring, which only adds to his already bizarre appearance.

The most striking feature of The Jester is his red clown eyes, which have led to a number of rumors surrounding this individual. However, there is no evidence to suggest that 4175 has any supernatural abilities.

The Jester is often seen with a lit cigarette, which he uses to punctuate his unusual sense of humor. Something of a creative mind, 4175 has a vivid imagination that sometimes leads to unusual hobbies and interests.

Known to enjoy writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, collecting rare items, and participating in live-action role-playing games, The Jester is always looking for ways to explore his unique personality. While some may be put off by his strange appearance and jester-like demeanor, The Jester is a valuable member of the team and a master at keeping morale high.
