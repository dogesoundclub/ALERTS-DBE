Description:

DSC-MATE-8637 is a human female with an unusual appearance. She has blonde hair with a wing attached to her head and two-color bands across the forehead. DSC-MATE-8637 is known for having orange stripes on her face, red lips, and a pair of goggles on her forehead. Finally, a black choker is worn around her neck.

DSC-MATE-8637 has been diagnosed with absent-minded and forgetful tendencies. Despite her profession as a firefighter, DSC-MATE-8637 has missed appointments, work schedules, and other vital events due to this behavior. During their watch or work, they can lose focus easily and get lost in thoughts or projects, leading to significant missed deadlines, and even putting others at risk if safety protocols are not followed.

As a result of DSC-MATE-8637's behavior, her containment is critical as sending her on any high-stress mission or emergency would be detrimental to anyone involved.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-8637 had no prior behavior issues before being recruited as a firefighter at the age of 25 to the Foundation's facility, and the anomalous nature of her existence had made her more susceptible to eccentric behavior. Psychological evaluation shows that her behavior may change over time, which will be monitored through rigorous testing to keep her and everyone else safe.
