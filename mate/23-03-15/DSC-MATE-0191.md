Item #: 191

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 191 is to be contained in a soundproofed chamber measuring 5m by 5m by 5m at all times. The walls of the chamber should be lined with soft materials to prevent any accidental injury that might occur due to the subject's natural reaction to being startled.

Description:
Subject 191 is a male rabbit identified as the theater manager who goes by the name of "Thistle". The subject stands roughly 180 centimeters tall when standing upright and is typically seen wearing a gold chain and earring, as well as carrying a candy stick. The bunny is fitted with a VR Rainbow LED system, giving the appearance of constantly changing eyes.

Personality:
Despite their laid-back and easy-going demeanor, Subject 191 is fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones, often getting into heated arguments with anyone who dares to insult friends or family members. When angered, the subject has been observed to exhibit extreme aggression, which contrasts heavily with their typical friendly persona.

Addendum:
Subject 191 has been documented to exhibit unusual abilities, such as the ability to create realistic illusions of its current surroundings, as well as the ability to manipulate sound waves to create a hypnotic effect on its human counterparts, causing them to fall into a trance-like state. Despite these unusual abilities, Subject 191 appears to be innocent and unaware of their power. Research is ongoing to determine the nature of these abilities and their limitations.
