ID # : DSC-MATE-3249
DSC-MATE-3249, also known as "The Fashionable Tiger", is a male tiger of an unknown origin. The creature possesses startling green hair fashioned into a stylish purple cap, alongside ski goggle eyes, and a medical mask as a mouth. These features are paired with a red scarf that complements his wild design choices.

DSC-MATE-3249's general behavior and duty-bound personality are equally exceptional for a tiger of his kind. The creature is known to be highly responsible, almost obsessively so, which frequently leads to him overcommitting himself to his different roles, like fashion designing or running a boutique.

DSC-MATE-3249, though he appears to be merely living and working like a regular citizen, is believed to have ample otherworldly abilities that assist him in his endeavors. Reports indicate that he can conjure up something from thin air and carry around more weight than any regular tiger could handle.

Despite his exceptional abilities, DSC-MATE-3249 is prone to ending up in hilarious scenarios due to his ambitious personality. His over-commitment leads to him taking on more than he can manage, as anyone observing from outside would agree. 

Furthermore, it has come to the attention of the DSC agency that DSC-MATE-3249 might be actively covering up his true origin and potential underlying intentions. Therefore, due to his mysteriousness and various capabilities, DSC-MATE-3249 is to be observed closely and consistently. Any possible threat detected must be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately.
