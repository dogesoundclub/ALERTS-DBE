ID # : DSC-MATE-5415
DSC-MATE-5415, also listed under the name "The Fashion Designer," is an anomalous human capable of manipulating fabric at a molecular level. He is a male individual, with a pleasant smile that can disarm even the most skeptical of his audiences.

His nerdy glasses hide the sharp glint in his eyes, a sign of his intelligence and creativity. Under the hood of his monk robes, his ears can occasionally be glimpsed, sporting a green cross-shaped earring that glows in the dark.

DSC-MATE-5415's signature accessory is his deep red scarf, which seems to have a life of its own. It can shift, stretch, and wrap itself around its owner in unpredictable ways, often achieving an eerie sentience that leaves onlookers unnerved.

DSC-MATE-5415's personality is as enigmatic as his clothing designs. He is an organized individual, who plans things ahead of time, but he is also known to succumb to his whimsical side without warning. These sudden outbursts of peculiar behavior have been documented to range from impromptu adventures with his friends to obscure party planning that, to the astonishment of all, ends up being the talk of the town.

Though DSC-MATE-5415's anomalous abilities are a cause for concern, he does not pose a direct threat to humanity. However, due to his spontaneous and unpredictable nature, he must be monitored at all times. Additionally, the foundation has enlisted his expertise in several design projects, which have yielded astounding results.
