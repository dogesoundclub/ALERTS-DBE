Object Class: Unusual

Species: Felis tigris (Tiger)

Gender: Male

Appearance: The subject appears as a rather tall Bengal tiger, standing at approximately two meters in height, with a fur coat that presents a smooth golden orange hue with black stripes. Their eyes are unknown, as the subject always wears a black hoodie that obscures their face to a considerable degree, complemented by a medical face mask that covers their fangs and conceals their breath. The reason behind the subject's attire is uncertain, as they claim the clothing provides a sense of security and presentiment.

Personality: Subject 8884 is constantly noted by peers for their exceptional attention to detail, approaching each case with a tenacious work ethic and a disciplined methodology that prioritizes meticulous observation over conjecture. However, this obsessive behavior appears to extend past their police work, as 8884 is known for peculiar compulsions such as sorting their books by spine color and measuring the width of their shoelaces. Despite this behavior, the subject is intensely driven, always striving for accuracy and precision in every aspect of their life.

Addendum: Agent 8884 has been brought in for an interview regarding recent reports of their unusual behavior. During the encounter, the subject displayed a notable reluctance to engage in small talk, preferring to keep the conversation focused solely on the case at hand. Moreover, despite their intimidating presence, the subject was not confrontational, instead displaying exceptional listening skills and carefully parsing through each question before answering. While the subject's obsession with detail may warrant further investigation, their devotion to the task is undeniable, and therefore they remain an invaluable asset to our detective team.
