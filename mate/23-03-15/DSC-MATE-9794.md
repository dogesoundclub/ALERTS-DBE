DSC-MATE-9794: The Overloaded Server

DSC-MATE-9794 was a female human with green hair and a purple cap. Her notable green cross earring adorned her ears and a silver chain hung around her neck. She worked as a fast food server at a local restaurant chain and was often seen rushing around, trying to complete her numerous duties.

Despite being overloaded with responsibilities, DSC-MATE-9794 possessed an unyielding sense of duty and responsibility that often got the better of her. She would try to take on more than she could handle, leading to some quite comical situations. At times, she would be seen clumsily trying to carry a mountain of food trays or attempting to squeeze in numerous orders into an already packed schedule.

The Foundation had monitored DSC-MATE-9794 for some time, noting her tendency to push herself to the limit. After observing her for multiple shifts and noticing an abnormal amount of tasks assigned to her, it was deemed that she possessed anomalous abilities.

Further investigation proved that DSC-MATE-9794 had the power to manipulate time within the small confines of the restaurant. She could speed up time, allowing for more tasks to be completed in a similar period. This energy seemed to be unconsciously released whenever she felt overwhelmed by her responsibilities.

The Foundation psychologist was consulted to help tackle the mental burden DSC-MATE-9794 felt, as her sense of obligation was putting a strain on her work and mental health. It was decided to conduct further testing with DSC-MATE-9794 and see if her powers could be better controlled.

DSC-MATE-9794 is currently being monitored and tested for her time-manipulation abilities, the results of which could lead to a better understanding of these unique powers. Further advancements could lead to new developments within the Foundation's understanding of time and space.
