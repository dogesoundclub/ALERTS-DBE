ID # : DSC-MATE-1911
DSC-MATE-1911, also known as "The Tiger Boss," is a fearsome sight to behold. This Mafia Boss is unlike any other in the world of urban fantasy, with his hardened look and fierce demeanor. DSC-MATE-1911 is a male tiger with piercing eyes behind his nerd glasses that seem to see through all deception.

His head is not arranged with a wild, unkempt mane of green fur, adding to his intimidating appearance. Two color bands across his forehead, combined with a pair of goggles resting atop, give him the look of a seasoned military commander. There is a red cross earring in each ear, and a silver chain around his neck adds to his charisma.

Perhaps most intriguing is DSC-MATE-1911's ability to sense things before they happen. He possesses a strong intuition that has often been mistaken for some form of psychic power. Anyone who speaks with him will feel like their thoughts have already been laid bare.

Despite his fearsome appearance, the Tiger Boss has a certain charm that makes people gravitate toward him. He is always seen with a cigarette, adding to his alpha-male mystique.

Anyone who crosses The Tiger Boss had better beware. He is a fierce predator who will do whatever it takes to protect his territory, and he always seems to know when someone is plotting against him. Those who try to outsmart him quickly realize that he is always one step ahead.
