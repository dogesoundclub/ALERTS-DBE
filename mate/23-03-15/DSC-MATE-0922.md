ID # : DSC-MATE-922
Identification number 922, also known as the Theater Manager, is an animatronic marvel to behold. This robot, designed to look like a human male, has a head adorned with a blue bandana which contrasts brilliantly with its metallic exterior. Covering its mouth is a medical mask, which obscures the frightened expression on its lips. 

Despite its appearance, the Theater Manager has a unique personality. Data indicate that it has a remarkable imagination, which translates into some rather peculiar hobbies and interests. It is not uncommon for the Theater Manager to write poetry or to create elaborate costumes, which it then showcases at various conventions. Rumors abound that the Theater Manager has a secret stash of unusual objects. However, access to these items is strictly regulated, making the theater's backroom the safest place for them. 

While the Theater Manager is a wonder to watch, it remains unlikely that any human being will ever fully understand its mechanics. Nevertheless, as long as audiences respect the Theater Manager's boundaries, they can be assured of an unforgettable performance.
