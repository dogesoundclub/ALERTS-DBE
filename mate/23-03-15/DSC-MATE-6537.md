DogeSoundClub Containment Protocol for Subject 6537 - Codename: "The Tiger Electrician"

Subject 6537 is a male tiger who manifests in the form of a humanoid electrician. His striking VR rainbow LED eyes and red beanie over his feline ears make him easily recognizable. He also sports a red cross earring and a silver chain accessory.

Born with the innate talent of manipulating electricity, 6537 works as an electrician in human society to blend in. Though genetically predisposed to aggression as a tiger, 6537 has been trained to suppress his predatory nature, and his behavior is now considered compliant and harmless.

While subject 6537 is usually reserved and keeps to himself, he has shown keen observational skills and heightened attention to detail, which make him an excellent gift-giver. However, his desire to give the "perfect" gift can make him overly concerned, wasting considerable time in the selection process. 

Any interaction with subject 6537 must be monitored and controlled, as he has the potential to become a dangerous predator if provoked. He is to be kept in isolated containment and provided with enough electronic equipment to keep him occupied. Any attempt to move 6537 out of his containment must follow strict protocol to ensure public and personnel safety.

DogeSoundClub recommends that any unauthorized contact with subject 6537 must be avoided as much as possible, and any observed behavior inconsistent with established protocols must be immediately reported to the appropriate authorities.
