ID # : DSC-MATE-6823
Subject 6823, also known as "The Real Estate Agent," is a male human of average height and build. His most notable feature is the large, black spot located on his mouth, which has been observed to move and contort in a manner that is abnormal for a human mouth. Witnesses have reported that the spot seems to have a mind of its own, making strange noises and whispers in languages that are not of this world. 

6823 is often seen wearing a blue bandana around his head, a jade earring in his left ear, and a silver chain around his neck. He is known to be a successful real estate agent, having made a fortune from selling properties that are rumored to be haunted or cursed. Despite his success, he maintains a reserved and introverted personality, preferring to keep to himself and stay out of the spotlight. 

However, those who have managed to crack his hard exterior have found that he has a wicked, dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. He has a talent for deadpan jokes that can leave people struggling to decipher whether or not he's serious. More disturbingly, witnesses have reported that he has an uncanny ability to predict the future of the properties he sells, often knowing in advance about any paranormal activities that may occur. 

The Foundation has classified subject 6823 as a Euclid class anomaly, due to the unpredictability of his mouth spot and his apparent knowledge and involvement with anomalous real estate properties. Extreme caution is advised when interacting with him, and strict containment measures are currently in place to prevent any potential breach.
