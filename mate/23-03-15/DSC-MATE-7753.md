Despite his outward appearance being that of a typical human, there are several notable anomalies present. The subject's eyes resemble that of ski goggles, providing a unique and intricate color-shifting effect. His head is adorned with a police cap, believed to be more of a fashion statement than an indication of his occupation. The Agent boasts a single jade earring on his right ear, which glows with an unknown energy source, leaving all researchers baffled as to its purpose.

One peculiarity that should not go unnoticed is the subject's mouth, which remains covered with a medical mask for reasons unknown.
