ID # : DSC-MATE-1402
Subject 1402 is a male rabbit, standing at approximately 4'5". The most notable feature of this subject is the bucket hat perched on their head, which shields their nerdy glasses and jade earring-adorned ears. The silver chain and whistle that they wear around their neck serves as a calling card to their profession, as they are a trusted and respected firefighter in their city.

This subject is known for their caring and nurturing personality, which extends beyond just those around them. They have been observed giving names to their car, talking to their plants and even anthropomorphizing their household appliances. Despite the tendency towards the affectionate, they can be fiercely protective and will do whatever it takes to keep those around them safe from harm.

As a rabbit, they possess incredible speed and agility, and their skills as a firefighter only add to their impressive physical abilities. Despite their small stature, they are a force to be reckoned with, and their presence on the front lines of a dangerous situation is a reassuring sight to all those in their city.

As with all DogeSoundClub subjects, it is important to monitor subject 1402's behavior closely, and to provide them with the support and care necessary to maintain their mental and emotional well-being. Their unique personality, combined with their undeniable skills as a firefighter, make them an invaluable member of their community, and an asset to the Foundation's mission.
