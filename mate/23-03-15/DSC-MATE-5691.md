ID # : DSC-MATE-5691
DSC-MATE-5691, codenamed "The Rabbit Villain," is a peculiar entity that appears to be a humanoid rabbit with an affinity for villainous activities. Its purple cap and headset appear to be part of its distinct appearance, and its two-color band on the forehead is a distinguishing mark that sets it apart from other rabbits.

Despite its mischievous nature, DSC-MATE-5691 exhibits a caring and nurturing personality that often surprises those who encounter it. Its behavior can sometimes lead to humorous situations, especially when it takes care of its associates as if they were its own children.

DSC-MATE-5691's silver chain is an object of interest that warrants further study. It appears to have some sort of anomalous property that influences the behavior of DSC-MATE-5691. Further observation and experimentation are needed to determine the true nature of this accessory.

As with all DSCs, DSC-MATE-5691 is to be contained and studied for the safety of the general population. Any sightings or reports regarding DSC-MATE-5691's activities should be immediately reported to the nearest Foundation office.
