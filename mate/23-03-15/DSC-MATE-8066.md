ID # : DSC-MATE-8066
DSC-MATE-8066, also known as "the Fast Food Robot", is a mysterious automaton whose origins remain unknown. While his outward appearance appears to be that of a typical fast food employee, several odd characteristics set him apart from human workers. Firstly, DSC-MATE-8066 bears a frightened mouth that seems to quiver and tremble in response to outside stimuli. Secondly, his eyes are peculiar horned rim glasses that seem to be permanently attached to his face. Lastly, DSC-MATE-8066's head is constantly covered by a hoodie, obscuring his true facial features from prying eyes.

As a robot, DSC-MATE-8066 is known for his software's ability to be in touch with his emotions. He reportedly reacts to sentimental moments in movies and TV shows and may be moved to tears by music or art that evokes strong feelings.

Despite his quirky characteristics, DSC-MATE-8066 is generally regarded as harmless and non-threatening. He takes pride in his work and performs his duties to the best of his ability, never causing any incidents or disturbances.
