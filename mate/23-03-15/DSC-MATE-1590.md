ID # : DSC-MATE-1590
Item #: DSC-MATE-1590

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-1590 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. The subject is permitted access to basic amenities such as entertainment and exercise equipment, but must be monitored at all times. Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-1590, as the subject's abilities may cause them to become emotionally invested in the subject's personality and agenda.

Description:
DSC-MATE-1590 appears to be a female human with distinctive spots on her face and a warm smile. The subject possesses a pair of Jade LED eyes and a Green Cross Earring design. DSC-MATE-1590's demeanor is charismatic and outgoing, often willing to engage in conversation and establish connections with others.

DSC-MATE-1590's ability to read and influence the emotions of those around her is a matter of concern. The subject has been known to induce amusement, laughter, and relaxation in others, which can distract or discourage attempts to control or monitor the subject. DSC-MATE-1590's personality has also been recorded as inspiring trust and openness, which could lead to infractions of Foundation security procedures if not diligently monitored.

DSC-MATE-1590's audio-visual powers have been noted and are being researched. The subject's Jade LED eyes can provide a 360-degree view, with audio amplification capabilities of up to 1 kilometer. However, it should be noted that the subject's eyes can also cause a possible hypnotic effect on those directly in front of it. Testing has started to check the full effects of DSC-MATE-1590's visual influence, and it may get updated as we learn more about its capabilities.

Additional Considerations:
DSC-MATE-1590's background and connection to the anomalous community are unknown. Suspicious histories of unexplained events, and incidents involving DSC-MATE-1590 recording devices in private or restricted areas, are under investigation. Due to its likability and ability to integrate with its surrounding, it's possible that DSC-MATE-1590 has acted in covert activities on behalf of unknown/deadly entities. If our current containment strategy fails, this should be taken into consideration.
