ID # : DSC-MATE-3212
DSC-MATE-3212, designated as a villain within the Foundation, is a male simian with a striking appearance. Sporting a pair of shade glasses and dual-colored band on his forehead, this primate is not to be underestimated. An additional Jade earring adorns one of his ears, making him stand out like a sore thumb.

DSC-MATE-3212 has a reputation for being highly observant and possessing an eye for detail. A skill that makes him an asset when it comes to planning heists or carrying out calculated acts of mischief. However, this gift also comes with a flaw. The Creature is inclined to become overly concerned with perfection when it comes to gift-giving, often spending extensive periods agonizing over what to give to individuals. 

With caution and skilled handling, DSC-MATE-3212 can prove a valuable tool in Foundation operations. But stay vigilant, as he is still a dangerous and unpredictable anomaly.
