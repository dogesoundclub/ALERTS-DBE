Description:

DSC-MATE-7203 is a male rabbit measuring 36 cm in height, and weighing approximately 1.5 kg. It has VR rainbow LED eyes and ears adorned with a gold earring. DSC-MATE-7203 wears a police cap on its head, suggesting a fondness for that profession. Its unique appearance distinguishes it from normal rabbits.

DSC-MATE-7203 is characterized by a strong sense of humor and often delights in making those around it laugh. It has an eccentric and playful nature, leading to humorous situations. DSC-MATE-7203 is known to tell amusing stories and perform silly impersonations.

DSC-MATE-7203 was first discovered in the aftermath of a security breach at a local museum. It had broken into the premises by gnawing through a door and fiercely defending the access point. Police were called but found the rabbit to be highly aggressive, as it refused to be caught. The professionalism and quick thinking of the security guard on duty, who managed to catch DSC-MATE-7203 using a simple carrot on a string, impressed Foundation observers. The individual was then recruited by the Foundation as an exemplary security guard.

DSC-MATE-7203 presents no known anomalous properties at present, but its unpredictable behavior and extra-human characteristics warrant its current classification as an Euclid class object. DSC-MATE-7203's behavior must continue to be monitored, lest this classification is changed. 

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-7203 has been observed astrally projecting itself beyond its containment chamber. The projection contains the rabbit's consciousness and manifests as a glitch in nearby electrical equipment. DSC-MATE-7203 has appeared to acknowledge this incident, but it retains its playful nature and has not shown hostile reactions. This occurrence is still under investigation by the Foundation.
