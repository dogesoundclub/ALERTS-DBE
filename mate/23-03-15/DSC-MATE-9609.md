ID # : DSC-MATE-9609
DogeSoundClub Classification: Euclid

DSC-MATE-9609, also known as "The Engineer," is a sentient, male Rabbit who works as a Train Driver for various transit systems across the world. He is easily identifiable by his signature red beanie and gold earring, as well as the VR jade LED eyes that emit a faint glow in low-light conditions.

While initially mild-mannered, DSC-MATE-9609 has shown signs of being highly organized and efficient in his work, to the point of being occasionally controlling. He has been known to take charge of group projects and events, easily delegating tasks to others in a matter-of-fact way that can sometimes come across as abrasive.

DSC-MATE-9609's silver chain and whistle are used to enforce authority when necessary, often in emergency situations when quick decision-making is required. Despite his tendencies towards control, DSC-MATE-9609 has shown a sense of humor, frequently making light of even the most dire situations.

Due to DSC-MATE-9609's unique species, special accommodations have been made to ensure his safety and comfort, including specialized quarters on trains and security measures to prevent unauthorized access to his equipment.

DSC-MATE-9609 is to be monitored closely for any signs of anomalous behavior or abilities, and any deviations from standard behavior are to be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities within the DogeSoundClub.
