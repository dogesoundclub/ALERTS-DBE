DSC-MATE-3880, also known as "The Jester", is a male human with striking red clown eyes that seem to pierce into the soul of those who dare to look into them. He sports a cap with purple and green hair and a pair of goggles on his forehead. A mysterious jade earring can be seen on his left ear, adding to the enigmatic persona that he carries. The Jester's identity is shrouded in secrecy, but his actions have earned him the title of "Villain" among those who have crossed his path. 

The Jester's mouth is covered with a medical mask, hinting at his proclivity for nefarious activities. His personality is as unpredictable as his appearance, as he tends to be scatterbrained and easily sidetracked. He has a tendency to forget appointments, meetings, or directions- leading to some comical situations that mask his true intentions. The Jester is a master of deception and manipulation, using his eccentric persona to lull his enemies into a false sense of security while he plans his next move. Approach with caution, as the Jester is not to be underestimated.
