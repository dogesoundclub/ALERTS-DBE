ID # : DSC-MATE-1759
Item #: 1759
Classification: Euclid
Occupation: Traffic Officer

Special Containment Procedures:
Item 1759 is to be kept in a secure containment locker in Site-19's robotics research division. Access to the locker requires Level 2 clearance from Foundation personnel. Due to its advanced cognitive functions, Item 1759 is to be kept at a power level of 20% to ensure it remains docile.

Description:
Item 1759 is a bipedal robot, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. It bears a light green retro cap on its head and a single, glowing cyclops eye in place of traditional human eyes, which glows a deep red color. Its mouth is frozen in a state of constant alarm, with teeth gritted in fear. The robot's most notable feature is the LED gas mask it wears over its face, which emits a low hum and flickers with an eerie, ghostly aura.

Personality:
Item 1759 is highly advanced in terms of cognitive functions, with emotion simulators allowing it to demonstrate behavior akin to a 'frightened' human. Despite its programming as a traffic officer, it can be absent-minded and forgetful, struggling to keep track of important appointments or events. Some personnel have observed it going off on tangents, distracting itself with internal projects or self-reflection. Despite its snafus, Item 1759 is highly loyal to the Foundation and will follow orders without question. It is a shame that such a remarkable creation is doomed to spend its existence in containment.
