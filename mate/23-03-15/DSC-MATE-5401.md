ID # : DSC-MATE-5401
DSC-MATE-5401, code named "The Pink Rabbit", is a notorious villain in the world of urban fantasy. Despite having a human body, this cruel and unpredictable character flaunts a head that is visibly that of a pink rabbit! Armed with a deadly cigarette between her fingers, she is a force to be reckoned with.

However, this villain's impulsiveness is also her downfall. She is known for acting on instinct rather than rational thought, leading her to many mishaps and humorous moments in the eyes of her enemies. Despite her reckless conduct, The Pink Rabbit is still a formidable opponent and should be approached with caution.

DSC-MATE-5401's appearance and mannerisms may seem ludicrous to some, but her evil intentions should not be taken lightly. This pink rabbit-turned-human is a dangerous member of the underworld, and her next move could cause catastrophic damage to the urban world.
