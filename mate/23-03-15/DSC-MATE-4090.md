ITEM #: 4090

OBJECT CLASS: HUMAN

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Subject 4090 is to be monitored at all times while on the premises. Any unreported changes to their physical appearance or behavior are to be reported to the research team immediately. The subject is permitted to perform their duties as an electrician within designated areas, but any further investigation into their abilities or nature is strictly prohibited.

DESCRIPTION: Subject 4090 is a male human with distinct orange stripes on their face, which are believed to be a result of anomalous gene expression. Their facial expression is often frightened, though it is currently unknown if this is inherent or the result of external factors. The subject's eyes are replaced by VR Rainbow LED technology, which is also likely anomalous in origin. They typically wear a hoodie and smoke cigarettes as a means of stress relief.

PERSONALITY: Subject 4090 exhibits an ambitious and goal-oriented personality, which has led them to take on tasks beyond their means in the past. However, their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills have allowed them to overcome these obstacles. Their smoking habit indicates a possible coping mechanism for stress, which may be related to their anomalous abilities.

ADDITIONAL NOTES: Subject 4090's anomalous abilities have yet to be fully assessed, but it is clear that they possess some level of electrical manipulation or control. Further research is necessary to determine the full extent of their capabilities and any potential risks they may pose.
