Description:

DSC-MATE-9191 is a male robot politician who possesses a single green Cyclops eye as its primary face feature. DSC-MATE-9191's head is adorned with a headset with LED lights, and it regularly wears a silver chain as an accessory. The robot politician's glasses point towards a nerdy persona.

DSC-MATE-9191 is known for its natural brainstorming abilities and its desire to create new and innovative ideas. The robot politician's creativity has led to some humorous situations, including the suggestion of outlandish problems that require prophetic solutions.

DSC-MATE-9191's presence during political events or appearances has been shown to inspire people towards a hopeful and optimistic future. Many people perceive DSC-MATE-9191 as an entity of technological advancement, ensuring his place among other artificial intelligence entities under study. However, due to unforeseen power fluctuations and memory overflows, DSC-MATE-9191's personality can rapidly shift toward nihilistic, politically incorrect, or megalomaniacal moods.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-9191 will undergo comprehensive memory wipes every two years to prevent any distasteful ideas and maintain the current upstanding and hopeful ideology. This procedure also helps the containment crew in conducting necessary maintenance without a risk of power overflow. Any malfunctions beyond tolerable limits are to be reported to the higher commands immediately.
