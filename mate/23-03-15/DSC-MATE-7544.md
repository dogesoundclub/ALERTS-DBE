ID # : DSC-MATE-7544
Identification number 7544 is a peculiar human female. Though seemingly harmless, her blonde hair hidden under an ushanka hat and red cross earrings, one can't help but notice the curious spots littering her face. She carries herself with a strong sense of independence, and a reporter's notebook is never far from her reach. But it's the odd accessories that truly make her stand out; a conspicuous LED gas mask attached to her side and a golden chain adorning her neck. 

It's clear that 7544 possesses a personality just as unique as her appearance. Her stubbornness may be her downfall as she refuses to ask for help, even in dire circumstances. Often caught trying to carry more than she can handle or wandering aimlessly without a map, she's sure to find herself in humorous situations. It's difficult to predict what this independent reporter will uncover next... or what secrets she may be keeping herself.
