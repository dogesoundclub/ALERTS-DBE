Subject 5280, codename "The Courier", is a human female with distinct orange stripes on her face and a contagious smile. Her unique eyes boast orange eyebrows, an anomaly in the human gene pool. Her head is reminiscent of a 00s school girl, completing her unconventional appearance. Observed on her forehead is a set of goggles, which she wears as an accessory.

As a delivery driver, The Courier's job requires her to be on the move, making her an elusive figure on surveillance. However, when she is spotted, she is often seen sporting a gold chain around her neck. Her personality is captivating- a creative spirit with a vivid imagination, and an affinity for hobbies considered eccentric to society. The Courier's hobbies range from writing poetry, crafting elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting peculiar objects.

The Courier's unique appearance and personality land her on the anomaly list. However, her skillset and resourcefulness warrant her containment under the PoI-628 unit of the DSC foundation. Agents are advised to exercise caution when approaching The Courier as she is known to utilize creativity and wit to evade capture.
