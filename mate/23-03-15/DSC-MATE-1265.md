ID # : DSC-MATE-1265
Item #: 1265

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 

Subject 1265 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times within Site-██. Access to 1265 does not require any special clearance level for research personnel, provided that they are escorted by at least two armed security personnel. During its work shift as a firefighter, 1265 is not to be hindered or impeded in any way.

Description:

1265 is a human male with unusual physical features. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs. Its strange appearance consists of orange stripes on its face, ski goggles for eyes, a retro cap on its head, gold earrings hanging from its ears, and a standard medical mask covering its mouth. Additionally, it wears a red scarf around its neck as an accessory.

1265 is not known to exhibit any perceptible paranormal abilities or to emit any dangerous radiation waves that could pose a threat to human safety. Nevertheless, its humorous and impotent behavior makes it an armful to contain, as it tends to break the security and safety protocols of the Foundation. 1265 enjoys making others laugh in its presence by telling funny stories or performing silly impersonations.

1265's primary job is as a firefighter, and it performs routine firefighting duties within the city of [REDACTED]. During its shift hours, it is required to wear specific firefighting gear that thereby conceals its face and the rest of its body from public view. Further investigations into the origin of its peculiar traits are underway by Foundation researchers, and it is not to be released into the public until more information about the source of its anomalous features is revealed.

Addendum: 1265 was recruited for the Foundation after rumors about sightings of a 'humorous firefighter' caused public panic in the city of [REDACTED]. It was spotted and later isolated by Foundation personnel and confirmed to be anomalous. The subsequent retrieval team consisted of a senior researcher and two armed agents, and the capture process was without incident.
