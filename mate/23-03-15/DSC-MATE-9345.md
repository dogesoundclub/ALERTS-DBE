ID # : DSC-MATE-9345
Identification number 9345 is a highly unique individual, even in the world of urban fantasy. Despite her human appearance, her facial features set her apart from the rest. Bright orange stripes adorn her cheeks, while her lips are an eye-catching shade of purple. Her blue clown eyes shimmer with an unfathomable depth, almost as if they hold secrets within secrets. Atop her head sits a gleaming tiara, symbolizing her innate leadership qualities. 

But her most interesting feature might just be the single goggle that remains perched on her forehead. This mysterious accessory suggests that her job as a banker may just be a facade for something more daring and adventurous. Her ears sport vibrant red cross earrings, hinting at a devotion to a higher power, perhaps even one beyond this world. Adding to her already stunning ensemble is a golden chain that dangles around her neck, accentuating her every move. 

Personality-wise, Identification number 9345 is a caring and nurturing spirit.

Don't be surprised if you overhear her having a heart-to-heart chat with her car or whispering sweet nothings to her potted fern. Her unique personality may seem eccentric to some, but it's what makes her stand out in a world full of mundanity.
