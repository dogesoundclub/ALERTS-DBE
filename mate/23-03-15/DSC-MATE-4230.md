ID # : DSC-MATE-4230
Subject 4230 is a human female, currently employed as a banker. She is easily recognizable, thanks to the odd markings on her face - a series of dark, spotted patterns that cover her cheeks and nose. These spots are unlike any known medical condition and seem to have supernatural origins. The subject is also known to wear a bucket hat on her head, presumably to shield herself from unwanted attention.

In addition to her unusual appearance, subject 4230 frequently dons a pair of normal glasses and sports a green cross earring on one ear. She can often be seen wearing a medical mask, even in situations where it may not be required. The subject is also known to wear a silver chain, which is believed to have talismanic properties.

Subject 4230 is known for having a particularly strong sense of intuition, bordering on the psychic. She has been observed to display a remarkable ability to predict future events or sense the emotions of those around her. This ability can be impressive, but also a bit eerie, especially to those who are skeptical of supernatural phenomena.

Overall, subject 4230 represents a unique case within our database of human specimens. Her appearance and abilities suggest she may have encountered paranormal forces at some point in her life. As with all DSCs, close monitoring and further investigation are recommended.
