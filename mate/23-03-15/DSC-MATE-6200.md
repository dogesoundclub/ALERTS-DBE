Subject 6200, also known as "The Enthusiast Banker", is an enigmatic character whose appearance is as interesting as her profession. At first glance, she appears as a regular human female, but a closer inspection reveals her unique facial features. Her face is adorned with striking orange stripes that accentuate her red lips. But what really sets her apart are her vibrant VR rainbow LED eyes that seem to emit a constant buzz of digital energy.

Her head is where things get really curious. On top of it sits a bright pink rabbit that moves in sync with her every move, making it seem like it's part of her. She is often seen wearing a choker and an LED gas mask, hinting at a possible past involving dangerous experimentation.

But despite her eccentric appearance, Subject 6200 is a successful banker that excels in her job. Her energetic and enthusiastic personality allows her to connect easily with clients and persuade them to invest in projects. She can make even the most mundane financial proposal sound exciting and worthwhile, sometimes to the point of comedic effect.

However, her boundless energy sometimes gets the best of her, causing her to become overly excited about topics that others may find boring or uninteresting. This can put her at odds with her more serious-minded colleagues who may see her as a distraction.

Subject 6200 remains largely a mystery, and her origins and motivations are yet to be revealed. Nevertheless, her presence brings a spark of excitement to any environment she enters.
