ID # : DSC-MATE-8027
Item #: 8027
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 8027 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. He is to be restrained via a straitjacket and have his red clown eyes covered with a blindfold. Access to any form of comedy, comedic media, or any individuals who provoke humor is strictly forbidden. All staff members who come into contact with 8027 must wear sound-reducing headphones to block out his infectious laughter. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to evacuate the area immediately and contact the on-site response team.

Description:
Subject 8027 is a human male of unknown age, approximated to be in his early thirties. He stands at a height of 6'1" and weighs approximately 195 lbs. The subject is most well-known for his piercing red clown eyes, which emit a hypnotic aura that forces anyone who makes eye contact to erupt into uncontrollable laughter. Additionally, he sports a gold earring in the right ear and a silver chain around his neck. The subject also possesses a standard gas mask, which he is commonly seen wearing.

Personality:
The subject is incredibly outgoing and social, taking pleasure in being the center of attention. Despite his inability to resist the urge to make those around him laugh, he shows no indication of hostility towards containment staff or the public at large. His sense of humor is astounding, and his jokes and stories often result in uncontrolled fits of laughter that can last for an extended period.

Like several other such entities being contained, Subject 8027 was initially thought to be a gimmick, a street performer of sorts that had somehow developed anomalous properties. However, further investigation from our Special Containment Team provided that he had initially been employed as a banker but was fired from his job after a video of him inadvertently making everyone laugh uncontrollably at a staff meeting went viral.

Addendum:
Subject 8027 was contained after he accidentally triggered an outbreak at a comedy club in New York, resulting in several injuries and one person dying from laughter. After this event, all attempts to administer psychotropic treatments or to dampen the effect of his eyes have yielded little success. It is believed that he suffers from a biopsychic condition and should be avoided by all personnel. His current containment is satisfactory, and keeping him mystified with Humourless Skulker is advised to avoid any unforeseeable accidents.
