ID # : DSC-MATE-3211
Subject 3211 is a primate specimen seemingly integrated into the human workforce in the limited capacity of a city firefighter. Lacking any significant intellectual or communicative faculties, the creature presents itself as a near-mute creature with a perpetually frightened mouth, likely due to its average human work environment. While its ocular features are currently unconfirmed, it is known to cover its head with a hoodie, an accessory that may potentially play a role in lessening hostility from human workers. 

Subject 3211 is commonly sighted sporting a red scarf and carrying a whistle. These objects could signify a level of emotional attachment or personal significance to the monkey, as neither object is deemed necessary for firefighting operations. 

Personality traits of this creature indicate a tendency towards independence and rebellion towards established authority. This attitude is prevalent in its behavior, with incidents of insubordination towards superiors. Subject 3211 has reportedly engaged in unauthorized activities, such as leaving work early or absenting itself from work without permission. 

Further monitoring and examination of this subject in human society is warranted to determine the extent of its cognitive capacity, its motivation for seeking employment, and the nature of its deviations from expected behavior.
