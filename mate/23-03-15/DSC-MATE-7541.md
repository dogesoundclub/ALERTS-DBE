ID # : DSC-MATE-7541
Subject 7541 is a peculiar individual, to say the least. A human of the female sex with a striking red lip, they are a veterinarian by trade, tending to various breeds of animals within their clinic. However, their interests go far beyond the confines of their occupation.

Subject 7541 is a collector of knowledge, spending countless hours researching and reading obscure topics. They have a particular fondness for educational materials such as books and documentaries, which they amass with great enthusiasm. Their passion for learning is only matched by their dedication to sharing their newfound knowledge with others.

Their appearance is no less striking than their personality. With normal glasses perched on their nose, they add a retro cap upon their head, with a goggle on their forehead for good measure. Their ears are adorned with a red cross earring, and they sport a gold chain around their neck. As if these accessories were not enough, they also carry a normal gas mask as another layer of precaution.

Subject 7541 is a rare breed, with an insatiable thirst for knowledge that never seems to be quenched. Their unique qualities are a valuable asset to any team or organization, and could prove to be a valuable ally in any urban fantasy world.
