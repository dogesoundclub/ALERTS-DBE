Species: Monkey

Designation: Poli-Mindreader

Appearance: 3672 is a male monkey who is easily identified by his nerdy glasses and signature blue bandana. He sports a single jade earring on his left ear and accessorizes with a gold chain around his neck. However, his most striking feature is the LED gas mask that he wears, which glows blue and green at night.

Personality: Possessing extraordinary intuition, 3672 can seem like a mind reader with his ability to predict future events and discern people's emotions from afar. As charming as this might seem, his skill can be eerie to those who encounter him. No one knows the source of his abilities, which have only grown stronger over time. Despite the questionable origins of his power, 3672 has found a niche in politics, where he can use his talents to predict the outcomes of political matters before anyone else can. 

Danger Level: Green

Containment Procedures: 3672 is allowed to remain free and not contained, given his importance to the political process. However, anyone who comes into contact with him must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation to ensure their emotions have not been manipulated by his powers. In addition, 3672 is required to wear a tracking device that monitors his movements near sensitive political locations to prevent any potential breaches. 

Notes: DSC 3672 is a curious anomaly in the world of politics. Although no evidence has been found to explain how he developed his powers, many speculate that he might have received exposure to anomalous chemicals. Until we uncover the truth, we must proceed with caution when dealing with 3672.
