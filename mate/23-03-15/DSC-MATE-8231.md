ID # : DSC-MATE-8231
Subject designated as ID 8231 is a human male, working as a reporter in the concrete jungle of the big city. He stands out amongst his fellow journalists with an eerie feature â€“ his mouth spot, which seems to constantly emit a strange glow. Observe that he appears frightened most times, unable to control his expression. 

Further inspection reveals his eyes, a pair of blue clown eyes that appear to be painted on with a deep sense of sorrow. His head, a pile of unkempt and not arranged green hair, adds to his bizarre appearance. One cannot help but stare at his mouth, concealed by a medical mask, hiding whatever secrets it may hold.

Along with his peculiar facial features, this subject has a silver chain looped around his neck, the significance remaining unknown. Despite his extraordinary looks, ID 8231's personality remains unusually scatterbrained, often getting sidetracked and lost in thought. His forgetfulness sometimes leads to unintentionally amusing situations, such as missing appointments or getting lost in the city's labyrinthine alleyways.

It is recommended to approach ID 8231 with caution and kindness, as he may be in a fragile state. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause of his strange features and personality.
