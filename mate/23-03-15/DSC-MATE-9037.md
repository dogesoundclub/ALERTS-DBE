DogeSoundClub Classification: Euclid

Item #: 9037

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 9037 is to be regularly monitored and kept under surveillance. They are to be provided with appropriate living quarters and granted access to typical amenities, such as food and water. Subject 9037's phone and internet activity are to be monitored for any potential threats to the Veil. Should any anomalous activity be detected, immediate action is to be taken as per standard protocol.

Description:

Subject 9037 is a human female of average height and build. Their most striking feature is their red lips, which stand out against their green hair that is often left unarranged. They wear normal glasses and a black choker, which they refuse to remove despite the objections of Foundation personnel. Subject 9037's profession is that of a veterinarian, although they have been known to take on odd jobs to make ends meet.

Subject 9037 possesses a strong sense of independence, often insisting on doing things by themselves even when it is impractical or dangerous. This stubbornness has led to some humorous situations, such as their attempts to move heavy furniture without help, or their insistence on navigating without a map despite being hopelessly lost.

It should be noted that Subject 9037 has displayed a degree of anomalous behavior. They have an innate ability to communicate with animals and can understand their thoughts and emotions. This ability has allowed them to diagnose and treat animals with exceptional accuracy, although the source of this ability is still unknown.

Despite their reluctance to ask for help, Subject 9037 has proven to be cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, caution should be exercised as they may be capable of breaching the Veil unintentionally due to their anomalous abilities.

Note from Doctor [REDACTED]: Subject 9037 may prove to be a valuable asset to the Foundation in the field of animal containment and research. Additional study and experimentation may be necessary to unlock the full potential of their abilities.
