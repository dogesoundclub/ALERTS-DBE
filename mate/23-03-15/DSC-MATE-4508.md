ID # : DSC-MATE-4508
Containment Procedures:

Subject 4508, also known as "Bunnyfire," is to be monitored closely at all times. Due to her ability to create flames with just a snap of her fingers, she must remain in a specialized containment unit. The unit is equipped with fire suppressants and cooling systems, as well as heat-resistant materials.

Description:

Subject 4508 appears to be a human female with distinctive spots on her face. However, her head resembles that of a pink rabbit, complete with long ears and orange eyebrows. She is often seen wearing a choker and gold earrings. Her most striking feature, though, is her eyes. They are a bright orange color and seemingly glow in the dark.

Personality:

Subject 4508 is known for her sense of humor and love of making others laugh. Her jokes and funny stories provide a much-needed break from the seriousness of containment procedures. However, her abilities should not be taken lightly, as she has been known to lose control of her flames when she gets too excited or emotional.

Containment Breach:

In the event of a containment breach, all personnel must evacuate the area immediately. Any attempts to contain Subject 4508 must be done with extreme caution, as her flames can easily spread and cause extensive damage. It is recommended to use fire-resistant suits and equipment when approaching her. Under no circumstances should anyone attempt to antagonize or provoke her, as this will only increase the risk of danger.
