ID # : DSC-MATE-8484
DSC-MATE-8484, also known as "The Boss", is a humanoid entity with distinct facial features. While presenting as a human female, DSC-MATE-8484 possesses orange stripes on their face, which may indicate a genetic anomaly or potent magical influence. However, the most remarkable aspect of DSC-MATE-8484 is their VR Rainbow LED eyes, which emit a bright light and may impair the vision of anyone attempting to make direct eye contact with The Boss.

Despite its questionable appearance, The Boss has an impressive ability to lead and organize a vast network of illicit activities from its position as a Mafia Boss. This organization spans the underworld and has established a level of control over the black market. Any resistance to their rule is quickly and efficiently quashed, and rumor has it that they possess supernatural abilities to enforce their will.

However, beneath this hard-edged exterior, DSC-MATE-8484 is a powerfully idealistic being who longs for a better future. They are often seen protesting against companies or nonsensical causes, as they are driven by a strong desire to make the world a better place. Despite the apparent double standard issued with their criminal activities, DSC-MATE-8484's romantic notions of a more perfect society have become a driving force for the organization they head.

The silver chain accessory, worn around their neck, is rumored to be a significant marker of their rank among the Mafia's hierarchy. And they are never seen without it.

Approach with caution when encountering DSC-MATE-8484, for behind that bright smile lies a potentially dangerous individual with ambitions beyond the human realm.
