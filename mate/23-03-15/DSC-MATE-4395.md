Subject 4395, codenamed "The Jester", is a devious and cunning villain with a twisted sense of humor. While appearing to be an average human male, 4395's most notable feature is a large, circular spot on the left side of his mouth, giving him a menacing and disturbing appearance. His head boasts a fierce peak spike, adding to his intimidating presence. 

But it's his accessories that truly set him apart. The Jester often wears a silver chain around his neck, a symbol of his need for control and domination. He also dons a normal gas mask, hiding his features and adding to his mysterious and unnerving demeanor.

It's the Jester's personality, however, that truly makes him stand out. His dry wit and deadpan humor often catch people off-guard, leaving them unsettled and uneasy. He revels in this discomfort, using it to his advantage in his villainous schemes.

Approach the Jester with caution, as he is not to be underestimated. His silver tongue and twisted humor may seem harmless at first, but they are the tools of a dangerous and calculated mind.
