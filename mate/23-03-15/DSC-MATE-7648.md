ID # : DSC-MATE-7648
Subject 7648 is a curious case, apparently a human politician with a peculiar appearance that separates him from the rest. His face is covered in countless spots, reminiscent of the freckles that adorn a child's skin. However, don't be fooled by his playful appearance - this creature is nothing to be trifled with.

The most striking feature of 7648 is his metallic purple head. It is unclear if he modified it in some obscure experiment, or if he belongs to a different species. Sources indicate that he is indeed human, but one cannot be too sure with such a unique physical trait.

Subject 7648's methodical, organized demeanor has earned him a reputation for being a bit controlling. His penchant for efficiency makes him an excellent leader, but it can also be off-putting to those around him. One cannot shake off the notion that he is concealing a deeper, darker agenda within his placid persona.

On the surface, 7648 appears normal enough - wearing normal glasses and a modest red scarf - but there is something undeniably off about him; His piercing stare unnerves anyone who meets his gaze for too long.

It is recommended that authorized personnel proceed with caution if they come into contact with Subject 7648. Although he may seem amiable on the surface, there is no telling what sort of machinations he may be cooking up behind the scenes.
