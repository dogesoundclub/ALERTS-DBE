ID # : DSC-MATE-2753
DogeSoundClub Identification Number 2753, also known as the "Monkey Cop," is a unique specimen of primates inhabiting the urban city. Despite its animalistic appearance, this creature holds a vital position, serving as a law enforcer, protecting the civilians from the paranormal threats lurking in the shadows.

The Monkey Cop has a frightened mouth, which furthers its comical outlook when combined with its Ski Goggle eyes that give it a perpetually surprised expression. Curiously, the primate wears a golden earring, which adds to its enigmatic persona. Additionally, it accessorizes with a red scarf that often flaps behind as it swings through the city on its patrols.

DSC-MATE-2753's species status is still unknown, as it demonstrates the ability to converse in human languages fluently, indicating a heightened level of intelligence. Its empathic abilities make it attuned to the emotional nuances of others, and the Monkey Cop often uses this ability to put people at ease, making it a valuable asset when handling high-stress situations.

While DSC-MATE-2753 may appear humorous at first glance, the Foundation maintains that it's a highly capable and cunning creature. Its solid police skills combined with its sensitivity to emotions make it a highly effective and irreplaceable member of the paranormal police force.
