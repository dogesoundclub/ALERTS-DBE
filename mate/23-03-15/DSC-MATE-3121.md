Subject 3121 is a curious case indeed. A mechanic by trade, they tinker with the inner workings of machinery and delight in their ability to understand and operate the most complex of devices. However, it is their physical appearance that truly sets them apart from the rest of their human brethren. Orange stripes, resembling those of a tiger, grace their face, and a band of two colors adorns their forehead, marking them as unique among their peers. Their ears bear a single golden earring, glinting in the dim light of their workshop. Always present is a red scarf draped around their neck, a splash of color against their otherwise muted clothing. 

But it is their personality that truly makes them stand out. Inspired by their love of learning, Subject 3121 possesses a vast array of knowledge on obscure topics, from the history of the Ancient Egyptians to the physics of black holes. And they are not afraid to share their knowledge with those around them, often spouting off trivia at seemingly random intervals. At times it can be amusing, but their curiosity can also get them in trouble, leading them to investigate things better left alone. But despite their quirks, they are a valuable asset to any team, bringing their expertise and inquisitive nature to every situation.
