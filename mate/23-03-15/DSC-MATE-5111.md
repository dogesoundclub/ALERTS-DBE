Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-5111 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19, with all interactions with personnel monitored via closed-circuit video. DSC-MATE-5111 is allowed access to basic beauty tools for self-care purposes only, as determined on case-by-case basis by assigned site doctor.

DSC-MATE-5111 is not to be allowed contact with any materials containing sugar, as this has been found to trigger anomalous behavior (see Incident-5111-A). Any accidental ingestion of sugar is to be reported immediately to on-site personnel.

Description:

DSC-MATE-5111 is a male human, approximately 33 years of age. DSC-MATE-5111 is 175cm in height and weighs 68kg. DSC-MATE-5111 presents with orange stripes on the sides of the face, parted pink hair on the head, and a pair of nerd glasses over the eyes. DSC-MATE-5111 possesses a goggle on the forehead and a jade earring in each ear. DSC-MATE-5111 is often seen carrying a candy stick, which is believed to be a non-anomalous accessory.

DSC-MATE-5111 works as a beautician in [REDACTED], Japan. It is thought that DSC-MATE-5111's trade contributed to their anomalous properties, which were first reported by local authorities in 20██. Reports indicate that DSC-MATE-5111 had gained a reputation for producing miraculous results with their clients, often exceeding any reasonable expectation in terms of beauty.

DSC-MATE-5111 has demonstrated a strict adherence to tradition, with a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to their work or any deviation from what is considered a "proper" treatment. However, DSC-MATE-5111 is also known to have a playful side, telling jokes and sharing stories passed down through their family or community. This behavior has sometimes led to anomalous events, such as clients temporarily losing their sense of time or space after a particularly entertaining anecdote.

Incident-5111-A:

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-5111 experienced a sugar overdose after consuming a large quantity of candy. This resulted in the manifestation of anomalous properties not previously observed by on-site personnel. DSC-MATE-5111 demonstrated the ability to markedly alter the physical appearance of individuals in their presence, turning them into anthropomorphic versions of various sweets and candy.

This incident resulted in significant property damage and a temporary breach of physical containment by DSC-MATE-5111. As a result, all materials containing sugar have been strictly prohibited from DSC-MATE-5111's containment area. Any accidental ingestion of sugar by DSC-MATE-5111 is to be immediately reported to on-site personnel.

Conclusion:

DSC-MATE-5111 is a unique humanoid entity possessing potent anomalous properties related to the practice of beautician work. While generally cooperative with Foundation staff, DSC-MATE-5111's playful nature must be carefully monitored to prevent possible anomalous events.
