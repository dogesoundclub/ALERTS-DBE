ID # : DSC-MATE-4439
DSC-MATE-4439, also known by the code name "The Untamed Agent", is a male tiger of undetermined age who has taken on the guise of a real estate agent in various urban areas. His bright red clown eyes are a notable feature, often causing discomfort and unease in those who meet him. 

DSC-MATE-4439 has stated that he chose the profession to fulfill his personal desire for independence and autonomy. Indeed, he has displayed a strong sense of rebellion towards any perceived authority or rules that he sees as unnecessary, sometimes leading to insubordinate behavior such as skipping work or taking time off without permission. 

While his species would typically suggest a more primal behavior, DSC-MATE-4439 appears to have adapted to human societal norms quite well, with the exception of his aforementioned rebellious tendencies. He is often seen wearing a silver chain as a fashion accessory, apparently indicating a personal preference for adornment. 

DSC-MATE-4439's true motivations and potential anomalous abilities are currently unknown, but his presence and actions suggest that he may be of interest to the Foundation's urban fantasy investigations. Further study and observation are required to determine the extent of his anomalous nature.
