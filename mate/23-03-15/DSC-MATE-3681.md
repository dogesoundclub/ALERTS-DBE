Subject #3681, known as the "Jester," is an enigmatic and charismatic politician in the urban fantasy world. Despite his human origin, his physical features deviate from the norm, particularly his red clown-like eyes that seem to hypnotize anyone who gazes into them for too long.

The Jester's smile is his trademark, but it can be hard to determine if it is genuine or if he uses it as a tool to manipulate others. He has a not-arranged green head, but his green cross earring and two-color band across his forehead give him a flamboyant edge that sets him apart from the usual political crowd.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the Jester's personality is his ability to balance his sense of duty and responsibility with his love of entertainment. He knows how to work a room and get everyone to take notice of him, whether it be through his energetic dance moves or off-the-wall humor. 

Though his humor can be a defense mechanism, the Jester takes his role as a politician seriously, and he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. He is not above making deals with supernatural entities, and his motivations and agenda are not always clear.

Approach with caution - the Jester's hypnotic eyes and boundless charisma might lure you into a trap you won't be able to escape from.
