ID # : DSC-MATE-4915
DSC-MATE-4915 is a peculiar creature, even by our standards. This anthropomorphic rabbit, despite its appearance, is a competent and licensed veterinarian, specializing in the treatment of all manner of beasts, both mundane and supernatural. His horned rim glasses may seem out of place, but they are a necessary tool of his trade to get a better look at his patient's symptoms. 

DSC-MATE-4915 sports a retro cap atop his head and a jade earring on his left ear, which we believe is an attempt to display a sense of style and individuality. However, his red scarf and LED gas mask are more of a mystery to us, and while he insists that he wears it for health reasons, we have yet to verify this claim through scientific testing.

The most striking characteristic of DSC-MATE-4915 is his insatiable curiosity. He devours books on obscure and esoteric topics, leading him to spout random, unassorted, and occasionally unsettling trivia to an unexpecting public. While usually harmless, this trait has caused him to become a bit awkward in social situations. 

DSC-MATE-4915 has proven an invaluable asset to the foundation's veterinary needs, and his unique perspective on the supernatural makes him a valuable source of information. However, we must continue to monitor DSC-MATE-4915 closely, as his unbridled curiosity sends him down strange and dangerous paths.
