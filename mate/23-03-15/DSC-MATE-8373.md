Subject 8373, dubbed "The Electrician," is a mechanical marvel unlike any other. As a robotic being, they possess a green cyclops eye that glares out from beneath a gnarled red beanie perched atop their metallic skull. A single jade earring dangles from a single metallic ear, as if to add a touch of elegance to an otherwise unremarkable exterior.

Their mouth is covered by a medical mask, masking any semblance of a true expression beyond this automaton facade. But do not be fooled by their stoic appearance- this electrician is one that packs a shocking sense of humor.

Those who cross their path often find themselves subject to a barrage of dry jokes and comments, delivered with an utterly deadpan expression that can leave even the most seasoned of humans taken aback. Though they may not actively seek out the attention of those around them, they have a knack for holding the room's attention through their unexpected quips.

As strange as it may seem, beneath the steely exterior of Subject 8373 lies a distinctly human quality: humor. So if you need someone to help mend your frayed wires or fix up that pesky electrical problem, you might just be lucky enough to be granted an audience with the Electrician- and a few laughs to boot.
