ID # : DSC-MATE-2822
DSC-MATE-2822, codenamed "Electrospark," is a male individual with distinctive facial features. His mouth spot is an anomalous mark that appears on his lips, resembling a miniature electric bolt. This feature often draws attention to his infectious smile, which appears to glow under certain lighting conditions. 

Electrospark's eyes are covered by a pair of ski goggles, a unique choice for a regular electrician. It is unknown if these goggles possess any anomalous properties. His head is that of a typical Caucasian male, with blonde hair and green cross earrings on his ears. 

He is often seen carrying around a candy stick, which he twirls between his fingers when deep in thought. Electrospark's personality skews towards the logical and analytical, making him well-suited for his profession. However, he also possesses a quick wit, often making dry, deadpan observations or teasing his acquaintances. 

Despite his lack of overtly strange traits, Electrospark is a valuable resource to the DogeSoundClub's urban fantasy operations. His rational thinking and talent for problem-solving make him an asset to any team.
