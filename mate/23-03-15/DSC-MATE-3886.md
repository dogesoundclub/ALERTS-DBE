Appearance: Hopscotch is a Rabbit with a frightened mouth and his eyes are fitted with VR Rainbow LED devices that cover his eyes. A Police Cap is always sitting on top of them. He wears a Silver Chain around his neck, and sports an LED Gas Mask covering the lower half of his face.

Personality: Hopscotch is one of the most unpredictable Delivery Drivers in the City. He often engages in risky behavior and is prone to impulsive decisions that can get him into serious trouble. His love for thrills often leads him to jump off of high structures and into bodies of water, even if it could potentially end in disaster. Despite his risk-taking tendencies, he is determined and hardworking, always eager to please his clients and complete his deliveries. 

Note: Hopscotch has been known to occasionally emit strange noises that have yet to be identified. It is advised to approach with caution if these noises escalate or if he begins to act erratically.
