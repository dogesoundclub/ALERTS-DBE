ID # : DSC-MATE-8120
DogeSoundClub Containment Briefing:

Identification number 8120 is a dangerous individual who operates outside of the law and poses a significant risk to both the foundation and the general public. This villainous human male is best recognized by his distinctive physical features, which include spotted skin, a bright pink parted hairstyle, and a disturbing clown mouth. His red clown eyes are unsettling and serve as a warning sign to those who might encounter him.

Despite his grotesque appearance and severe psychosis, 8120 is highly intelligent and cunning. He maintains a strong sense of independence and views himself as a rebel against the established order, which he sees as oppressive and unnecessary. This defiant attitude often leads him to act out in rebellious ways, such as sneaking out of work or taking unapproved days off.

The greatest threat posed by 8120 is his willingness to commit acts of violence and terror in the name of his twisted ideology. He has been linked to several high-profile attacks on foundation personnel and facilities, using his skills and resources to evade capture and continue spreading his poisonous message of chaos and destruction.

Containment procedures for 8120 are currently in effect, and all personnel are instructed to report any sightings or suspicious behavior to their superiors immediately. Under no circumstances should anyone attempt to engage with or confront this individual, as doing so could result in serious injury or death. The safety of the foundation and the world at large demands that 8120 be brought to justice and contained indefinitely.
