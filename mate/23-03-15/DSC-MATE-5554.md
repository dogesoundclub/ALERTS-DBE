Subject 5554, also known as "The Politician," is a male human with a rather unusual appearance. His most striking feature is a distinctive spot on his mouth, making it appear as if he has a permanent smirk on his face. His red clown eyes are a result of a rather unfortunate accident involving a cursed carnival mirror, but he seems to have adapted to his new look quite well.

He is often seen wearing a retro cap and a green cross earring, which may have some sort of religious or symbolic significance. His mouth is almost always covered by a medical mask, perhaps to hide the spot on his lip or due to a medical condition.

While his appearance may be somewhat off-putting to some, Subject 5554's personality is quite charming. He has a creative and artistic side, which he expresses through various hobbies such as painting, drawing, and writing. He seems to be quite passionate about his art, and it is rumored that several of his paintings have sold for astronomical prices on the black market.

Of course, being a politician, there is always more to Subject 5554 than meets the eye. His intentions and affiliations are difficult to discern, and some believe that he may be involved in the supernatural underworld that lurks in the shadows of the city.

Subject 5554's gold chain is a symbol of his wealth and power, and it is said that he never removes it from around his neck. Whether he is a force for good or evil remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain - when The Politician is involved, things are never quite what they seem.
