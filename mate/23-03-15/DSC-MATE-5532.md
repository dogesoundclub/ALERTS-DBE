ID # : DSC-MATE-5532
Subject 5532 is a human male, identified as a programmer by trade. The most notable physical characteristic of this individual is a dark spot that adorns the lower right corner of their mouth. However, it's the unnatural quality of their eyes that is truly concerning. The sclera of both irises have been replaced with red clown-like orbs, bringing an unsettling aura to an already disturbing sight.

Their scared mouth often speaks of dark whispers and nervous energy. Cloaked in a retro cap and adorned with a jade earring, 5532 seems to prefer vintage fashion within their personal style. On colder days, they can be seen sporting a red scarf, adding a pop of color to their monochromatic attire.

5532 is intelligent, with their quick wit and love of debate being well-known. Despite the humour and playful banter that may occur between friends and family, it is important to note that they can just as easily turn this side of their personality inward. This introspection can lead them down dangerous paths of self-doubt and uncertainty.

Proceed with caution when approaching subject 5532, as their troubled energy and strange appearance can prove intimidating to some. Further observations are needed to uncover the true nature of this particular human specimen.
