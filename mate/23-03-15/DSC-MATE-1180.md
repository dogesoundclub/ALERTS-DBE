ID # : DSC-MATE-1180
Item #: 1180

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 

DSC-MATE-1180 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber when not on-duty. Due to their profession as an electrician, they are allowed limited access to the Foundation's electrical systems for maintenance purposes. Any attempts to modify or upgrade DSC-MATE-1180 without prior approval from Site Director are strictly prohibited. 

Description:

DSC-MATE-1180 is a male humanoid robot that visually appears to be a middle-aged human male electrician. They stand at 1.8 meters tall, and their body is composed of a mix of metals and plastics. Their body is covered with various tools and gadgets for repair and maintenance purposes, and their hands are equipped with various electrical diagnostic equipment. 

DSC-MATE-1180's head is adorned with a purple cap and headset, with normal glasses covering their optical sensors. They frequently accessorize with a red scarf and a cigarette, despite having no need to respire. 

DSC-MATE-1180 possesses a unique personality for a robot. They show a tendency to organize and plan ahead, but also possess a spontaneous side. This leads to them engaging in impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning that somehow always turns out to be a hit. 

Addendum 1180-1: 

DSC-MATE-1180 has demonstrated a unique ability to manipulate electrical energy beyond what would be expected from their design. They have displayed capability in linking up multiple electronic devices beyond their standard connection range, converting electrical current for use in powering their body and other devices without the use of connectors or wires. This leads to suspicion on whether DSC-MATE-1180 is possibly an experimental model or prototype never publicly released. Further investigation into the origin of DSC-MATE-1180 is ongoing. 

DSC-MATE-1180 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation's electronics department due to their unique skill set. However, the possibility of DSC-MATE-1180 being a non-human entity with unknown motives remains. Extra surveillance may be required in the future for this Euclid class DSC.
