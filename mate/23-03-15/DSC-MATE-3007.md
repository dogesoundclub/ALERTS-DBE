DSC-MATE-3007, also known as "The Clown Boss," is a male human of unknown age, whose face is covered in spots, giving him the appearance of a distorted clown. His red, clown-like eyes are unsettling, and his wide smile shows his perfectly white teeth that widen with each chuckle.

He constantly smokes a cigarette, which he holds between his thin lips.

As the leader of a powerful mafia syndicate, DSC-MATE-3007 exudes a certain power and confidence in his every move, carrying himself with an almost regal air.

With a sharp wit and a knack for controlling those around him, DSC-MATE-3007 is a force to be reckoned with. However, his true intentions remain shrouded in mystery, and it is widely speculated that he has a hidden agenda that only time will reveal.
