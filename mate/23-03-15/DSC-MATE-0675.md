ID # : DSC-MATE-675
DSC-MATE-675, commonly referred to as The Salesbot, is a humanoid robot with a retro cap and a red scarf wrapped around its neck. His most notable feature is his bright green cyclops eye, which scans his environment and analyzes potential customers with uncanny accuracy. The Salesbot is always seen wearing a pair of nerd glasses, providing him with a distinctively intellectual appearance.

Despite this robotic appearance, DSC-MATE-675 has an amusingly quirky personality. He is a natural brainstormer and loves coming up with new and creative ideas, often resulting in hilarious circumstances. His outlandish suggestions to problems are made purely for his own enjoyment, watching others react to his unconventional solutions. DSC-MATE-675's sense of humor is often dry, accompanied by the constant presence of a cigarette in his mouth.

As a car salesman, The Salesbot is a master of his craft, providing only the finest and most advanced models to his customers. He is incredibly persuasive in his sales pitch, often convincing buyers to select a high-end vehicle they never thought they could afford. However, DSC-MATE-675's true motives are unclear, and its magical abilities cannot be easily explained. Caution must be urged at all times when interacting with The Salesbot.
