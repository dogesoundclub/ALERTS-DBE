Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-9600 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any requests for literature or traditional agricultural tools are to be reviewed and processed by two Level 2 personnel, and any items deemed safe are to be provided to DSC-MATE-9600. Any personnel are strictly prohibited from smoking in the vicinity of DSC-MATE-9600's containment chamber.

Description:
DSC-MATE-9600 is a male human farmer with orange stripes on his face and blue clown eyes. He wears a retro cap with a goggle on his forehead and a gold earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-9600 is often seen with a red scarf around his neck and a cigarette in his mouth.

DSC-MATE-9600 shows a strong preference for tradition and maintaining his agricultural practices. This can lead to a no-nonsense attitude but also a playful side, often telling humorous stories or jokes that have been passed down through his family or community. However, DSC-MATE-9600 shows a deep distrust of authority figures and may become hostile when challenged or threatened.

DSC-MATE-9600 displays a remarkable proficiency in traditional agricultural techniques and has been observed to make crops yield above their typical growth rates. Additionally, DSC-MATE-9600 appears to have minor reality-bending capabilities, displaying the ability to summon items that would be instrumental to an agricultural task, regardless of the availability of the item on-site.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-9600 was discovered in rural Ukraine, where it was rumoured to have worked miracles on the local crops. DogeSoundClub agents were dispatched after a sustained increase in anomalous vegetable growth rates were reported in the area. During capture, DSC-MATE-9600 was uncooperative and highly resistant to any form of coercion. However, after being promised the ability to continue his work, DSC-MATE-9600 agreed to cooperate with DogeSoundClub researchers. Further research is needed to understand the full extent of DSC-MATE-9600's abilities.
