ID # : DSC-MATE-509
Subject 509, also known as "Hopper" amongst their colleagues, is a Rabbit humanoid of the male sex. This individual currently works as a Car Salesman, however, their unique appearance and caring personality make them stand out amongst the humans they interact with on a daily basis.  
 
One can easily identify this Rabbit humanoid by their VR Jade LED eyes that light up in a mesmerizing manner. Their appearance is further accentuated by a Retro Cap with goggles set upon their forehead, and a sparkling gold earring. The Rabbit humanoid is often seen wearing a gold chain as their sole accessory, which only adds to the aura of sophistication it exudes. 

Despite their unique appearance, this Rabbit humanoid possesses a personality that is equally remarkable. They are known for being exceptionally caring and nurturing, often going above and beyond to help out others in times of need. Their maternal instincts have earned them a reputation amongst their peers for treating their friends and loved ones as their own children - resulting in some humorous situations at times. 

Researchers at our facility hypothesize that Subject 509's compassionate personality and nurturing tendencies may stem from their species' behavior patterns in the wild. Whether or not this theory is accurate remains to be seen, but the Rabbit humanoid surely stands out from their human colleagues thanks to their distinctive appearance and endearing personality.
