Dr. ███████: DSC-MATE-9233, can you tell me about your abilities?

Dr. ███████: Have you ever tried to control your powers?

DSC-MATE-9233: Of course, but it's hard to hold back how you feel, you know? And when I get really emotional, it's like I'm lost in my own power. 

Dr. ███████: Thank you for your time, DSC-MATE-9233.
