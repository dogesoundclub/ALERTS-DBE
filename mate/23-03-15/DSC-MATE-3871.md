ID # : DSC-MATE-3871
DSC-MATE-3871, codenamed "The Electrician", is a male Bengal tiger who appears to be dressed as a police officer. He sports a fetching police cap and a medical mask, both of which seem to be of little practical use for a tiger. However, his most notable feature is his eyes - they have been modified with VR Rainbow LED technology, giving him an almost robotic appearance.

DSC-MATE-3871 works as an electrician and is exceptionally skilled in his profession. He has been reported to be able to identify electrical faults with incredible accuracy, often taking the time to note down every minor detail. This attention to detail also extends to his personal life, with DSC-MATE-3871 being a thoughtful and observant individual.

Despite his technological enhancements, DSC-MATE-3871 is not without his quirks. He has a fondness for gold jewelry and often wears a gold earring and chain as accessories. He is also known to have an almost obsessive focus on gift-giving, spending vast amounts of time trying to find the "perfect" present for others.

In the field, DSC-MATE-3871's electrical expertise has proven invaluable in containment efforts, often being called upon to troubleshoot electrical anomalies or to perform maintenance on critical systems. He has displayed a calm and methodical demeanor during these operations, earning the respect of his fellow Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-3871 is housed in a specialized containment chamber that has been designed to mitigate his electrical output. All electronic devices within his vicinity must undergo rigorous testing before being allowed entry, and no high-voltage equipment is to be allowed in his presence without prior approval.

Overall, DSC-MATE-3871 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, both for his technical skills and his impeccable attention to detail. However, care must be taken to ensure that his tendencies towards prolonged gift-giving do not interfere with his work.
