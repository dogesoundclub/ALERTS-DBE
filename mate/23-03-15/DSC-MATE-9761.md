Subject 9761, codename "The Doctor", is a human female with distinguishing spots on her face. Her striking orange eyebrows contrast with her hair, which is styled to the side in the same orange hue. She often wears a medical mask covering her mouth, revealing only a glimpse of her lips. She is rarely seen without her signature silver chain, which resembles a stethoscope and is believed to have special properties of unknown origin. 

Despite her mysterious appearance, "The Doctor" is known for her exceptional thinking abilities and her natural talent for brainstorming. She thrives on coming up with innovative and creative solutions to problems, no matter how unconventional they may seem. However, her quirky personality can often lead to humorous situations, where she suggests outlandish ideas just to see how others will react. 

It is rumored that "The Doctor" has a secret laboratory where she conducts experiments on various mythical creatures and creatures of urban legends, but this remains unconfirmed. Nevertheless, her expertise in medical and scientific fields has earned her a place among the top researchers in the urban fantasy world. The exact nature and origin of her silver chain remains a mystery to this day, but it is believed to hold invaluable knowledge that she uses to her advantage. Perhaps one day, DogeSoundClub researchers will uncover the true extent of her powers and unravel the mysteries of this enigmatic "Doctor".
