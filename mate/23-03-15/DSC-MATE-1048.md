Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 1048 is to be monitored by a team of agents who specialize in handling and resolving disputes within the supernatural community. All interactions with 1048 must be approved beforehand by the current Site Director.

Description:
Subject 1048 is a female human with distinct spots on her face and a perpetually smiling expression. Her eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, and her head is partially orange on one side. On her ears, she wears a single, gold earring. To conceal her identity, she wears a medical mask over her mouth. 1048 is also commonly seen wearing a gold chain around her neck.

Personality:
While subject 1048 appears like most humans, they have an unparalleled sense of duty and responsibility. She takes her job as a Traffic Officer seriously, going out of her way to help and protect the citizens of the city. This occasionally leads to her taking on more responsibility than she can handle, resulting in amusing situations like trying to carry too many things at once or struggling to fit all her tasks into a single day.

Due to her ethics and strong moral compass, she has frequently found herself in dangerous encounters with supernatural entities. However, she maintains a calm and collected exterior, acting as a valuable asset to the organization.

Addendum: 
Note that subject 1048 has developed a rapport with the sorceress known as "the Raven."  Exercise caution during encounters with both subjects to minimize any disruption of normal procedures.
