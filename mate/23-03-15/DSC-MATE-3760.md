Designation: Officer Purple Lip

Species: Human

Gender: Female

Physical Description:
Officer Purple Lip has a unique appearance that is sure to turn heads. Her face is characterized by a striking, deep purple lipstick that contrasts with her pale skin. However, it is her hair and accessories that are truly attention-grabbing. Her hair is a shimmering metal blue that seems to shift in the light, making it difficult to look away. Her ears are adorned with a single green cross earring, and she often wears a black choker around her neck. Additionally, she is frequently seen wearing a medical mask, though the reason for this is unknown.

Personality:
Officer Purple Lip is an enigmatic person who is prone to getting lost in her own thoughts. While this can be a strength when it comes to creativity and innovation, it can also lead to some humorous situations - like absentmindedly walking into a pole or tripping over her own feet. Despite her introspective tendencies, Officer Purple Lip is still an effective police officer who is highly dedicated to her job.
