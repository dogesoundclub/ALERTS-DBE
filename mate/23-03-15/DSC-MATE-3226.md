Subject 3226 is a male monkey with a unique appearance. His frightened mouth is always slightly agape, and his eyes are magnified by a pair of thick nerd glasses. However, what truly sets him apart is his bright pink head, parted down the middle and adorned with a two-color band across his forehead. A flashy gold earring glimmers in each of his ears, adding a touch of studious flair to his look.

Despite his quirky appearance, 3226 is a reporter with a sharp mind and a keen eye for detail. He often spends hours observing and analyzing his surroundings, which can make him an invaluable asset to any team. However, his perfectionist tendencies can sometimes cause him to become fixated on small details, leading to indecisiveness and overthinking.

To protect himself from any potential hazards he may encounter during his work, 3226 often dons a standard-issue gas mask. Though it may seem excessive to some, he feels safer and more prepared with it on.

Overall, subject 3226 is a peculiar but dependable character in the urban fantasy universe. His unique traits and talents make him a valuable ally, as long as you can tolerate his occasional indecisiveness.
