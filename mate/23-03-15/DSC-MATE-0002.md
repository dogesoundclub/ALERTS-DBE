ID # : DSC-MATE-2
Item #: 2

Object Class: Sapient

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-2 is to be contained in standard humanoid containment quarters. Access to any form of internet is strictly prohibited. Any print material to be provided to DSC-MATE-2 must go through rigorous security screening by Foundation personnel.

Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-2 be allowed access to any digital devices.

Description:

DSC-MATE-2 is a male monkey of unknown species. It stands at 1 meter tall and weighs approximately 30 kg. The eyes of DSC-MATE-2 are unclear as the goggle on its forehead obstructs vision. 

DSC-MATE-2 is characterized by the set of 2 color bands on its forehead, and a gold earring on each ear, while a gold chain adorns its neck. It's a proficient programmer with an appetite for knowledge, spending hours reading about obscure topics and relishing sharing its newfound know-how with others. 

DSC-MATE-2's sartorial style is largely unremarkable, with the exception of the accessories on its forehead, ears, and neck.

DSC-MATE-2 has demonstrated signs of maturity, respect for authority, and calmness when interacting with Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-2 is observed to be mild-mannered and cooperative, leading to lower security measures in containment protocols. However, this is subject to change.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-2 has requested books on astrophysics and has quoted the famous astrophysicist Carl Sagan repeatedly. It has also raised questions about the ethics of the Foundation and the extent of the harm prevention versus testing on DSCs. Any further requests to access information outside of containment protocols are to be answered with irrational, unrelated answers only.
