ID # : DSC-MATE-8705
DogeSoundClub Record: 8705 "The Electric Rabbit"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-8705 is currently in the care of the DogeSoundClub, and is kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber has been modified to include a designated power outlet connected directly to the foundation's main generator. The door to the containment chamber must always remain locked, with access only granted to authorized personnel. Personnel must wear ear protection when entering the chamber to avoid any damage from the high-pitched noises made by DSC-MATE-8705.

Description:
DSC-MATE-8705 is an anomalous rabbit with a physical form similar to that of a common European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It is a male and stands at 1.2m (4ft) tall when fully upright. One distinctive characteristic of DSC-MATE-8705 is a set of ski goggle eyes, which it wears at all times but can be removed with some level of difficulty. DSC-MATE-8705 commonly wears a blue bandana around its head and a silver chain around its neck. It also has a whistle that is always within reach. DSC-MATE-8705’s behavior indicates that it has knowledge of the use of electrical wiring, and has been observed "fixing" or "modifying" electrical systems during its period of containment.

Personality:
DSC-MATE-8705 values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude that is characteristic of a seasoned professional electrician. It has a playful side and enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through its family and community. This could be a potential threat if DSC-MATE-8705 were to reveal the existence of the foundation through its storytelling. Outside of these moments, DSC-MATE-8705 is often focused on its duty to maintain electrical systems.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-8705 was retrieved by the DogeSoundClub after an incident in a residential district of [REDACTED], Massachusetts. Several reports of electrical disturbances were lodged via the local fire department in the span of a month. The cause of these incidents was linked to DSC-MATE-8705 who had been working as an electrician within the area. Foundation agent ██████ was assigned to monitor and retrieve DSC-MATE-8705, which led to its eventual containment. Further testing is ongoing.
