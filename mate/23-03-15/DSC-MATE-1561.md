DSC-MATE-1561 is to be kept in a secure location within Site-██. No personnel are allowed to approach or interact with the entity without prior approval by at least two (2) level 3 personnel.

Description:

DSC-MATE-1561 is a highly advanced robotic entity that appears to resemble a human male in their early 30s. The entity's head features a retro cap with a green cyclops eye in the center. Two nerd glasses are visible on the entity's face, accompanied by a single red cross earring on the right ear.

DSC-MATE-1561 is highly skilled in mechanics and technology, and current analyses suggest that the entity's abilities are far beyond human limitations. DSC-MATE-1561 is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck, which appears to be capable of regenerating after being damaged.

Personality wise, DSC-MATE-1561 appears to have a fascination for adventure and may indulge in taking risks or trying new things, often leading to humorous near-death experiences such as bungee jumping, skydiving, or exploring wilderness areas. DSC-MATE-1561 has shown a willingness to assist Foundation personnel with their technological requirements, but may also require specific rewards or incentives to remain cooperative.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1561 has been noted for expressing free will and acting independently upon rare occasions, even when it conflicted with orders from Foundation personnel. Further study is needed to ascertain whether this characteristic is an indication of sentience or an unforeseen glitch.
