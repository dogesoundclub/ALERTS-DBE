ID # : DSC-MATE-9773
DSC-MATE-9773 appears to be a normal human male, but upon closer inspection, several abnormalities are apparent. The subject possesses a mouth spot, resembling a circular patch of skin that appears to be perpetually wet. Additional facial features include a frightened mouth, which seems to be in a permanent state of distress, and red clown eyes that give the appearance of constant terror.

The subject's head is parted pink, which appears to be a natural hair color rather than a result of any anomalous effects. However, the subject also wears a gold earring in one ear, which may be an intentional fashion statement or may have some deeper significance.

DSC-MATE-9773's personality is notably erratic, with a tendency towards impulsivity and risk-taking. This tendency can lead to some bizarre and entertaining situations, such as sudden jumps off cliffs or impromptu dance parties in public areas. It is unclear if this personality trait is a result of any anomalous effects or if it is simply a personal quirk of the subject.

Despite these abnormalities, DSC-MATE-9773 appears to function normally in society, holding down a job as a police officer. However, given the subject's unusual appearance and behavior, it is recommended that caution be exercised in their interactions with the general public.
