ID # : DSC-MATE-8088
Subject 8088, also known as "The Politician," is a human female with striking orange stripes across her face. Her smile is infectious, drawing in those around her with ease. However, her eyes are a unique shade of orange, almost resembling eyebrows more than the typical eye color. On her forehead rests a pair of goggles, presumably to aid her in her day-to-day tasks. She wears a green cross earring, a symbol of her faith or perhaps a lucky talisman. 

What truly sets her apart is the medical mask that obscures her mouth, adding an air of mystery to her already intriguing appearance. Dangling from her neck is a silver chain, possibly a sentimental piece of jewelry or a statement of wealth and power. 

Despite her political career, subject 8088 seems to be in touch with her emotions, often moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. She also has a deep appreciation for music or art that evokes strong feelings. Though her position may suggest a hard exterior, there is a softness to her that draws people in and keeps them loyal. 

Approach with caution, as The Politician may use her emotional intelligence and charm to manipulate those around her to achieve her goals.
