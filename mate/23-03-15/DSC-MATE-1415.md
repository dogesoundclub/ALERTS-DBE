Subject 1415, codenamed "The Hare Politician", is a remarkable specimen belonging to the Oryctolagus cuniculus species. Despite being a herbivorous creature known for their timidness, 1415 is a prominent politician in his state's government. He is often seen in his signature blue bandana and normal glasses, which add to his quirky appearance. However, his frightened mouth embodies the fear that constantly plagues him, a fear that could consume him if he lets his guard down.

The Hare Politician is an astute and analytical individual who enjoys indulging in intellectual debates and discussions. He is often found engrossed in his logical reasoning, leaving many to wonder how a rabbit could be so intelligent. He is not afraid to engage in intense arguments over trivial and unimportant topics, which can sometimes lead to humorous yet absurd situations.

Despite being a public figure, this rabbit prefers to keep to himself and often spends his time smoking a cigarette while lost in thought. His unusual yet charming personality is a testament to the fact that appearances can be deceptive. However, one must remember that the Hare Politician is a rabbit and should not be trifled with. His sharp mind and cunning wit could make him an excellent ally, but one must always remain wary of his fear.
