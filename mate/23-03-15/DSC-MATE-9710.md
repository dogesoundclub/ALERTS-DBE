DogeSoundClub Description:

DSC-MATE-9710, nicknamed "The Tiger Trafficker" by local law enforcement, is a humanoid tiger of unknown origin who currently works as a traffic officer in a major metropolitan area. DSC-MATE-9710's physical appearance is similar to other tiger-humanoid hybrids, possessing orange fur with black stripes, piercing VR rainbow LED eyes, and a frightened expression on their mouth, which is concealed by a medical mask. DSC-MATE-9710 also wears a purple cap with green hair and a gold chain clenched in their teeth.

DSC-MATE-9710's most notable trait is their extreme sensitivity to the emotions of those around them. The subject has shown to be deeply empathetic and understanding towards others and is often moved to emotional outbursts and tears when they witness another's pain or suffering. DSC-MATE-9710 is also fond of animals and nature, with a particular affinity for felines of all types.

DSC-MATE-9710's behavior as a traffic officer is described as professional yet distant, with the subject showing a reluctance to engage with motorists unless absolutely necessary. DSC-MATE-9710's presence on the force has resulted in a significant reduction in traffic-related accidents, as the subject's heightened senses and reflexes allow them to detect and prevent accidents before they occur.

Despite DSC-MATE-9710's usefulness as a traffic officer, the subject remains under 24/7 surveillance due to their unknown origins and unpredictable emotional outbursts. Researchers have recommended that DSC-MATE-9710 undergo counseling to better control their empathic abilities and prevent any potential breaches of containment.
