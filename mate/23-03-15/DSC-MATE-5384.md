ID # : DSC-MATE-5384
Subject 5384, also known as "Bugs" among his coworkers, is a rabbit of unknown origin currently employed as a fast food worker. Despite their timid appearance and frequent expression of fear, it is rumored that Bugs is cunning and quick on their feet. 

He sports a doge hat atop his head, perhaps to conceal his true identity or add to the charm of his demeanor. Bugs' normal glasses adorn his wide, frightened eyes, as if he is aware of something otherworldly lurking just out of sight.

Interestingly enough, Bugs is accessorized with a flashy gold earring and a silver chain, adding a touch of glamour to even the most mundane of workplaces. However, it is his cigarette that draws the most attention, as it is unknown how a rabbit could possibly smoke.

Despite his somewhat cowardly appearance, Bugs is known for his wit and love of argumentation. His playful banter and lighthearted debates have resulted in many amusing moments with friends and family members. However, his true nature and purpose remain shrouded in mystery. 

DogeSoundClub personnel are advised to proceed with caution when approaching subject 5384.
