ID # : DSC-MATE-7815
DSC-MATE-7815, also known as the "Red Beanie Lawyer", is a humanoid entity that appears to take on the form of a middle-aged male lawyer with a strikingly unusual facial feature - a constant, toothy smile that stretches from ear to ear. Beneath those unnerving red clown eyes lie a mind that is constantly aware of its surroundings, regularly observing with a critical eye the actions and intentions of those around him.

Perhaps the most noticeable feature of DSC-MATE-7815 is the bright red beanie that covers his head, adorned with a pair of unique goggles that rest atop his forehead. While it is unclear what purpose these goggles serve, it is believed that they may give this creature some form of heightened awareness or perception beyond that of normal humans.

The lawyer persona that DSC-MATE-7815 takes on often allows it to move freely throughout society, potentially gathering information and carrying out secretive tasks under the guise of legal or professional duties. It is advised to keep a close eye on any legal proceedings involving this entity or any situations where it may be acting on behalf of a client.

While DSC-MATE-7815 may seem friendly and generous at times, particularly when it comes to gift-giving, its unwavering pursuit of the "perfect" present can cause it to become obsessive and overly-analytical, leading to potential social awkwardness or misunderstandings. Regardless of its personality quirks, caution is always advised when approaching or interacting with DSC-MATE-7815.
