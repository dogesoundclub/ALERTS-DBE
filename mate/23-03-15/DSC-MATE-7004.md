File 7004: Dr. Iris Haze

Containment measures are in place for Dr. Iris Haze, a human doctor with peculiar physical features. Dr. Haze is identified by their purple lip, green hair in a purple cap, and the cybernetic VR rainbow LED eyes. Furthermore, they are usually seen donning a gold chain as their accessory.

Due to Dr. Haze's absent-mindedness and tendency to get lost in thought or work, it is essential to monitor their whereabouts and ensure they tend to appointments promptly. Failure to do so may result in missing important events, causing detrimental consequences.

It is highly recommended that any interaction with Dr. Haze is kept brief and structured, as their erratic behavior can trigger unpredictable responses. Their medical expertise is highly valued, but caution must be exercised to prevent incidents that could threaten the stability of our operations.

Continue monitoring and analyzing Dr. Iris Haze's behavior, and update their file as necessary. The Foundation's safety and secrecy must be prioritized above all else.
