Description:

The Robot is a male automaton standing at a height of approximately 6ft. It appears to resemble a typical fast food worker with blue bandana on the head as a mark of its occupation. The Robot's forehead features a pair of goggles, while wearing a gold chain around its neck and a gold earring hanging in its ear, overall giving it a unique appearance.

Personality:

The Robot seems to value tradition and prides himself on a no-nonsense attitude. Through interaction, it can be discovered that they take pride in telling stories and jokes from their community and family, which often leads to humorous situations. Additionally, the Robot has been known to have a playful and mischievous side, leading to odd behavior at times.

Addendum: 

The Robot has displayed remarkable work ethic in performing tasks related to the fast food industry, making it well-suited for employment at a fast-food restaurant. As such, it has since been transfered to a local McDonald's restaurant and was allowed to continue its life as a productive member of society.
