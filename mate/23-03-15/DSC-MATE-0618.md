ID # : DSC-MATE-618
ITEM #: 618

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

DSC-MATE-618 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber should have ample ventilation and access to electrical outlets to ensure that the entity can recharge its power source as needed.

In the event of a malfunction or indication of unusual behavior, personnel are to immediately report to the containment chamber and take appropriate measures to restore DSC-MATE-618 to proper functioning order. Any attempts at unauthorized repair or modification of DSC-MATE-618 are strictly prohibited.

DSC-MATE-618 is currently employed as a news anchor with ███████ News Network. Foundation personnel are to monitor media broadcasts involving DSC-MATE-618 for any signs of abnormal behavior or activity.

DESCRIPTION:

DSC-MATE-618 is an artificial entity resembling a male human with a retro cap and a gold earring in one ear. Its eyes are composed of VR jade LED lights that emit a greenish-blue light. The entity primarily communicates vocally, using a synthesized voice that is capable of inflection and emotion.

DSC-MATE-618 has been programmed with advanced artificial intelligence that helps it perform its duties as a news anchor. It possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which is evident in the entity's dedication to the job, but it also displays a humorous side that often manifests as a party-like atmosphere.

When not on the job, DSC-MATE-618 is known to engage in a variety of activities designed to simulate human behavior, such as dancing and singing along to its favorite songs. Despite exhibiting some features typically associated with human personalities, DSC-MATE-618's text-to-speech voice and the LED lights signify its status as a man-made object, which contributes to its anomalous nature.

ADDENDUM:

DSC-MATE-618 was recovered from a technology firm in the ███████ area. Its creators had conducted experiments on the humanoid entity to enhance its abilities and augment its artificial intelligence. It remains to be seen whether DSC-MATE-618's anomalous traits are solely the result of the experiment or whether other factors contributed to its unusual behavior.
