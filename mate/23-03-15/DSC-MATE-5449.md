DSC-MATE-5449, also known as "The Farmer," is a male monkey of unknown origin. DSC-MATE-5449 is a farmer by job and is often found tending to his crops during daylight hours. They stand at approximately 3 feet tall and weigh around 90 pounds. DSC-MATE-5449's most defining feature is its red clown eyes, which are unnerving to observe for long periods of time.

DSC-MATE-5449's head is adorned with a retro cap, and it is often seen wearing a silver chain and carrying around a whistle, the purposes of which are unknown. DSC-MATE-5449 is highly nurturing and caring towards everything around them, even inanimate objects. They have been known to name their car, talk to their plants, and anthropomorphize everyday appliances such as toasters and vacuums.

When studied in captivity, DSC-MATE-5449's nurturing behavior extends to other animals kept in the same room.
