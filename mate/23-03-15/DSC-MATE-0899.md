ID # : DSC-MATE-899
DSC-MATE-899, also known as "The Empathic Rabbit," is a male member of the lagomorph species who currently works as a fast food worker. He can always be identified by his normal glasses, doge hat, and jade earring on his left ear. On his forehead, he dons a two-color band to indicate his status among his fellow rabbit friends. He is often seen sporting a red scarf and carrying a candy stick around with him. 

DSC-MATE-899 appears to have a deep empathy and understanding for others, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering. He has a strong fondness for animals and nature, often seen interacting with birds, squirrels, and other small creatures. 

Despite his empathic abilities, DSC-MATE-899 can also become easily overwhelmed by strong emotions and may require containment in case of a particularly emotionally charged situation. It is important to note that care should be taken when exposing him to instances of cruelty or violence, as these can cause extreme distress in him. 

DSC-MATE-899 has shown no signs of any anomalous abilities aside from his empathic nature, but should nonetheless be monitored carefully in case of any unusual behavior.
