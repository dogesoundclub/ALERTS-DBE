ID # : DSC-MATE-9768
ENTITY CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Entity 9768 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Personnel interacting with the entity must wear high-density earplugs and VR-resistant eye protection due to the nature of the entity's anomalous properties. Entity 9768 may be permitted limited social interactions with other entities under strict supervision.

DESCRIPTION: Entity 9768 is a humanoid entity of the species Homo sapiens, appearing as a young adult female with pigtail hair and a distinctive purple lip. The entity's irises have been replaced with VR Jade LED technology, giving them a glowing green appearance. Entity 9768 displays a high degree of social intelligence and values harmony and social connections. Despite this, the entity possesses a playful and somewhat goofy personality which can often lead to humorous situations.

The entity has several anomalous features, including a goggle-like device positioned on their forehead and a jade earring inserted into their right ear. These devices have not shown any inherent abnormalities but appear to be a part of the entity's personal style. Further testing is required to fully understand the nature of these objects and their relationship to the entity's anomalous properties.

The true nature of entity 9768's anomalous abilities is not entirely understood, but it appears to influence nearby technology in unpredictable ways. The entity's presence disrupts electronic devices and causes distortions in nearby networks. The full extent of the entity's anomalous properties must be further studied to determine their full potential for danger or usefulness.

ADDENDUM: Entity 9768 was discovered following a series of strange incidents at a local bank where they were employed in a managerial position. Their unique traits quickly drew the attention of Foundation operatives, who were able to safely contain the entity and bring them to Site-███ for further study. Entity 9768 has been cooperative thus far and has shown no signs of aggression or hostility towards Foundation personnel. As always, caution is advised in dealing with any unexplained entities.
