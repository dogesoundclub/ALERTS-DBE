ID # : DSC-MATE-1828
Subject 1828, also known as "The Green Cyclops" is a male humanoid robot with a distinct, single green eye on his forehead. Coded as a villain, this mechanical marvel is a force to be reckoned with in the underworld of urban fantasy.

Subject 1828 is adorned with horned rim glasses, and a red scarf around its metallic neck that one can't help but wonder the purpose of. Coupled with a cigarette that frequently billows smoke, this robot wreaks a vibe of nonchalance and cool that almost belies its destructive power.

The not arranged green head of Subject 1828 rests atop a set of shoulders that are sculpted in metallic perfection. Adding a touch of whimsy are the jade earrings that dangle from its mechanical ears.

Subject 1828's strong and decisive personality make it an effective and efficient problem-solver - though one that can sometimes intimidate or come across as a bit bossy to those who don't know him well. It is important to maintain caution in dealing with Subject 1828, as the consequences of defiance may not be desirable.
