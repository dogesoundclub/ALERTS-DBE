ID # : DSC-MATE-8251
**Item #:** 8251

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item 8251 is to be contained within a secure locker at all times. Any attempts at unauthorized access are to be reported to O5 personnel immediately. Item 8251 is not to be activated without express permission from at least two level 4 personnel.

**Description:** Item 8251 appears as a humanoid robot with a standard fireman's outfit. It is equipped with a green cyclops eye and VR rainbow LED eyes. A goggle is positioned on its forehead. Its ears are adorned with red cross earrings, and it wears a silver chain around its neck at all times. Item 8251 also carries a whistle.

When activated, Item 8251 displays personality traits consistent with those of a stubborn and independent individual. Despite being a robot, it exhibits a desire to function independently and a reluctance to ask for assistance, even when it is obviously needed. This distinctive trait makes it commonly misjudge its own abilities, leading it into situations it cannot handle alone.

These tendencies often lead to humorous situations that can nevertheless create dangerous conditions for both the object and outside personnel. Misuse of its abilities has resulted in several security breaches, and as such, personnel must be aware of Item 8251's presence at all times.

**Addendum:** Item 8251 presents unique challenges to the Foundation's approach to containment. It is a sentient being with its own set of behavioral patterns that do not fit neatly into the Foundation's expectations. We must approach it with caution to ensure its safe containment while respecting its independent nature.
