DSC-MATE-5552, also referred to as "The Monkey Beautician", is a sentient monkey species specimen that works as a beautician at a high-end salon in the heart of the city. Identified by its red clown eyes, Doge hat, and Jade earring, this quirky creature tends to forget appointments and often gets lost in thought, which can lead to some hilarious blunders.

However, DSC-MATE-5552's sharp skills and artistic talents have made it a highly sought-after beautician, with its ability to transform its clients into glamorous and stunning creatures. The Monkey Beautician's signature touch includes its red scarf and whistle, which allegedly help to bring out its creative genius.
