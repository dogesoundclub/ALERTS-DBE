ID # : DSC-MATE-7458
DSC Identification Number 7458: The Independent Farmer

This human female displays a personality that may lead to her designation as an DSC. Identified as an independent farmer, her appearance is marked with a pair of normal glasses that obscure her eyes, obscuring the possibility of eavesdropping or reading her thoughts. Her head sports a metallic blue color that may be due to the DSC's connection to a particular spectral realm. A two-color band that partially covers her forehead is thought to function as a protective talisman against malevolent entities. 

Further inspection shows that she wears a red cross earring that may be connected to an organization related to spiritual or mystical practices. DSC-MATE-7458 also likes to adorn her neck with a choker, which may have an unknown power that aids in her survival. Additionally, she appears to possess a cigarette, which causes confusion among researchers who have yet to identify its significance.

Her personality is one of rebellion and independence. It is said that she actively disregards consequences or rules that stifle her freedom, leading to a chaotic and unpredictable persona. She has been observed to sneak out of the office early or take days off without permission. Her stubborness and resistance to authority may make her difficult to handle, but they may also prove valuable in isolated operations.

Researchers have yet to determine DSC-MATE-7458's true potential, but as is typical with DSCs displaying high levels of unpredictability, they will continue monitoring her activities and behavior for the safety of all involved.
