Item #: 209

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 209 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As a species, rabbits are generally considered to be non-anomalous and harmless, however, due to the peculiarities of 209’s personality and perceived abilities, it is deemed necessary to keep the subject under close observation. Standard security protocols are in effect with regard to the transportation of the subject, as well as all interactions with it.

Description:

Subject 209 appears to be a humanoid rabbit, standing at approximately 5'6" and weighing 137 pounds. His face bears a recognition feature in the form of a permanently frightened mouth, which appears to be in a constant state of mild panic. He is often seen wearing a blue bandana, which seems to serve as a form of comfort object for the subject.

Additionally, the subject sports a jade earring in each ear and a gold chain around his neck. Subject 209 has demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for practical problem-solving, frequently using unconventional techniques and materials to accomplish tasks. Whether repairing a train or rigging up a makeshift solution to a problem, 209 seems to have an uncanny ability to think on his feet and improvise as needed.

Personality:

Subject 209 generally presents as a calm and collected individual, in spite of his perpetually frightened mouth. He tends to approach problems in a practical and hands-on manner, preferring to tackle issues head-on rather than dwelling on them. Despite his apparent skittishness, 209 has displayed a surprising amount of bravery and tenacity when faced with adversity. He appears to have a strong sense of justice and a deep-seated desire to help others, often going above and beyond the call of duty to do so.

Conclusion:

Subject 209’s abilities and personality are a source of great interest to the DogeSoundClub, and further study may shed light on the nature of his particular brand of practical problem-solving. It is recommended that security protocols remain in place while interacting with the subject, and that this report be updated as new information becomes available.
