DogeSoundClub Description:

DSC-MATE-6914, also known as "Sparky", is a humanoid monkey of unknown origin. It was brought to the Foundation's attention after reports of electrical disturbances and power outages were linked to its presence in the area. DSC-MATE-6914 currently works as an electrician for the Foundation under strict supervision.

The subject is male and sports a red beanie on its head, covering most of its facial features. Its frightened mouth is often visible when startled or nervous, adding to the overall uneasy impression it tends to leave on personnel. DSC-MATE-6914's eyes, though difficult to discern, appear to be small and dark, almost as if staring blindly into the distance.

While DSC-MATE-6914's technical skills prove valuable to the Foundation, its distracted demeanor can often lead to complications in its assigned tasks. It is prone to becoming lost in thought or overly focused on a project, which can lead to humorous but potentially dangerous situations. DSC-MATE-6914 is easily agitated when disturbed, and it tends to blow its whistle repeatedly as a form of protest.

Several experiments have been conducted to determine DSC-MATE-6914's cognitive abilities and behavioral patterns, yielding mixed results. It has displayed some level of problem-solving skills and social cognition, but further testing is required to fully comprehend its intelligence.

Overall, DSC-MATE-6914 should be treated with caution and respect. While it is capable of completing its duties effectively, its absent-minded tendencies and agitated responses can lead to unpredictable situations.
