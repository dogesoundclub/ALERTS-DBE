Special Containment Procedures: 

Subject 7381 is to be contained in a privately-owned retreat located in a secluded area far from civilization. The retreat must have a large outdoor area with plenty of trees, grasslands, and rivers to provide a natural environment for the subject. A team of caretakers must be on site to monitor the subject's behavior and provide necessary care. 

No human interaction with the subject is allowed unless it is supervised by licensed professionals. Any attempt to harm or harass the subject will result in immediate disciplinary action.

Description:

Subject 7381 is a male Monkey with blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth expression. The subject wears a red beanie, a jade earring, and a silver chain. An LED gas mask provides further protection for his face.

Subject 7381 displays a deep empathy and understanding of others, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when they witness someone else's pain or suffering. They have a fondness for animals and nature.

During election campaigns, 7381's participation resulted in an undeniable popular vote. His speeches and promises have led to the rise of utopistic society modelled after nature's harmony. 

However, 7381's condition requires a secluded environment due to urbanization. Any attempt to migrate from the current containment unit will lead to political and social instability.

Addendum:

7381's popularity has created a ripple effect in the society, leading to peaceful protests, and advocating for animal rights. Any further development must be carefully monitored.
