Subject 3726, also known as "The Analytical Banker", is a human female with unique physical attributes. Her most notable feature is a series of spots that adorn her face, giving her an almost otherworldly appearance. However, what truly sets her apart are her VR Rainbow LED eyes, which shine like prisms in the night.

The subject's head is a vibrant green hue, with edge curls adding a touch of whimsy to an otherwise professional demeanor. Her jade earrings are delicate and understated, but nonetheless emit a faint energy that hints at her hidden talents.

Quite the inquisitive mind, 3726 is incredibly analytical and logical, always striving to understand and make sense of the world around her. Even her job as a banker is the result of her fascination with numbers and statistics, favoring meticulous calculations over guesswork.

Though she may come across as a tad austere, The Analytical Banker has a quirky sense of humor that belies her sober facade. Always ready with a witty observation, she loves nothing more than to tease her friends in a dry, deadpan manner.

Handle with Care.
