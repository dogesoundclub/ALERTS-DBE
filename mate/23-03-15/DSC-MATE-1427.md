ID # : DSC-MATE-1427
Subject 1427, also known as "The Car Saleswoman", is a peculiar sight to behold. She appears to be a human female with striking orange eyebrows that may indicate some sort of supernatural abilities. Her head bears the unmistakable look of an 00s school girl, complete with a goggle on her forehead that seems to serve no practical purpose. Her ears sport green cross earrings that suggest she may have affiliations with certain occult groups. 

The most baffling aspect of Subject 1427's appearance is the gold chain that hangs around her neck, and the normal gas mask she wears. It is unknown whether these accessories have any significance to her abilities or job as a car salesman. 

Despite her enigmatic appearance, Subject 1427 possess a strong sense of independence that can make her difficult to work with. She is often reluctant to ask for help even when she clearly needs it, which can lead her to hilarious situations such as trying to lift heavy furniture on her own, or stubbornly refusing to use a map when she finds herself completely lost. 

Beware, there may be more to The Car Saleswoman than meets the eye. Proceed with caution.
