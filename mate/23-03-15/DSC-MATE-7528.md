ID # : DSC-MATE-7528
DSC-MATE-7528 is a lithe, human female of average height and build, with distinctive bright orange eyebrows framing her vivid green eyes. She sports a unique accessory -- a set of modified goggles placed atop her forehead for quick use during her investigative work. Additionally, her pierced ears bear a gold earring on each. Strangely, she can often be seen wearing a choker around her neck, seemingly a self-expression rather than a necessity.

However, the most unusual element of DSC-MATE-7528's appearance is the plain, unassuming gas mask she always keeps on hand - a prudent attempt to protect herself from unexpected, hazardous environmental factors.

DSC-MATE-7528 has a vivacious personality that can draw people's attention effortlessly. She often acts as the life of the party or center of attention, entertaining those around her with witty stories and an infectious sense of humor. These qualities can come in handy in her line of work as an investigative reporter, giving her the social finesse to acquire information and interact with sources easily.

The Foundation has expressed high regard for DSC-MATE-7528's unique abilities as a reporter and has employed her as an undercover agent in numerous instances. However, her tendency to seek out danger in pursuit of a hot story and take risks that other personnel would consider unacceptable also poses a potential problem.

Thus, DSC-MATE-7528 is under constant surveillance, and her access to secure Foundation areas is highly regulated, ensuring that her adventurous spirit does not pose a risk to the Foundation's goals of protecting the masquerade and containing supernatural entities.
