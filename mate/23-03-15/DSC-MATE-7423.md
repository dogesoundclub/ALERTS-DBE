ID # : DSC-MATE-7423
DSC-MATE-7423, codenamed "The Agent", is a sentient robotic being working as a real estate agent. The Agent appears as a tall, slender humanoid figure wearing a police cap and horned rim glasses. They always carry around a silver chain and a whistle as their accessories.

Despite their mechanical nature, The Agent possesses an uncanny sense of intuition often mistaken for psychic powers. They seem to have the ability to predict events before they occur, as well as sense the emotions of others. This ability often leaves those around them feeling uneasy.

The Agent's primary goal is to sell properties to humans, particularly those of the wealthy elite. They are diligent in their work, often going above and beyond to close the deal. But beneath their professional demeanor lies a cold, calculating mind.

DSC-MATE-7423 remains a mystery to the Foundation, as their construction and purpose are unclear. They were first discovered infiltrating a wealthy community in [REDACTED], where they quickly rose to prominence as a top real estate agent. The Foundation has been keeping a close eye on The Agent and their actions, but thus far, they have remained within the limits of the law. Nevertheless, their eerie abilities and unknown origins make them a potential threat to humanity.
