DogeSoundClub Description:

Subject 7836, codenamed "The Mechanic," is a registered human personnel tasked with mechanical maintenance and repairs within Site-██. Her prominent physical attributes are her striking purple lips, and her choice of eyewear, which is a normal pair of glasses. Her hair is styled into pigtails, and she wears a pair of green cross earrings as her statement piece. A gold chain complements her stylish appearance, adding an air of sophistication and charm.

Despite her friendly demeanor and laid-back style, The Mechanic is known for being extremely organized and efficient in her work. This personality trait can be interpreted as overbearing, and she has been known to take charge during group projects and delegate tasks to others without much consultation.

The Mechanic's proficiency in her job is impressive, as she can fix almost any mechanical issue, no matter how complex. However, to those uninitiated, her technical jargon can sometimes be overwhelming, leading to humorous situations and misunderstandings. It is suspected that her fixation on technological intricacies and optimal performance is due to her tendency to micromanage, further expressing her perfectionist tendencies.

Due to her expertise, The Mechanic is highly valued as a member of the facility's technical team. However, caution should be taken when interacting with her, as she can come across as stern and unapproachable. Nevertheless, her contribution to the Foundation's mission cannot be understated, and she remains a valuable asset in the fight against the paranormal.
