ID # : DSC-MATE-1434
Item #: 1434

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1434, also known as "The Banker", is to be contained in a reinforced, soundproof chamber at Site-██. Access to this chamber is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Any interaction with 1434 is to be closely monitored and supervised by at least two armed security personnel at all times.

Description:

Subject 1434 is a male tiger of unknown origin, measuring approximately 2.5 meters in length and weighing around 250 kg. Its face shows a permanent expression of fear, even in apparently calm situations. Its eyes are always obscured by a pair of thick nerd glasses.

Subject 1434 wears a police cap on its head and a pair of goggles resting on its forehead. It also sports a jade earring on each ear, a gold chain around its neck, and carries a whistle on its belt.

1434 is able to communicate fluently in human language, and seems to have an extensive knowledge of human culture, history, and science. Its main interest is banking and finance, and it claims to have worked as a banker for a prestigious institution in the past.

Subject 1434 has a compulsion for knowledge and constantly seeks new information through any means available, including but not limited to books, digital libraries, or conversations with knowledgeable individuals. Its eagerness to learn can sometimes lead to obsessive behavior, and it can become irritable or aggressive when unable to obtain the desired information.

Addendum:

Agent ███████ was tasked with interviewing 1434 for further insights into its behavior and motivations. During the interview, 1434 appeared cooperative and provided detailed accounts of its past experiences in the banking industry. However, when asked about its origin or how it acquired its knowledge, 1434 became evasive and refused to answer.

Further investigation revealed that several instances of financial fraud and embezzlement were linked to a bank that had employed someone resembling 1434. The connection between 1434 and these crimes remains inconclusive, but caution should be exercised when dealing with any financial advice or services provided by the subject.
