DSC-MATE-8610, codenamed "The Programmer," is a male rabbit of unknown origin who possesses an unusual set of characteristics for his species. His face is often marked by a permanently frightened expression, which can cause disquiet and unease in those around him. His eyes are a peculiar set of ski goggle lenses, which enable him to see through fog and smoke with ease.

The Programmer is a remarkable leader, a natural talent in his field, and often finds himself taking charge of situations, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in his personal life. He is a methodical and analytical thinker, with an impressive grasp of technology and programming knowledge. This makes him a valuable asset to any team that needs his help, but also means that he often becomes the go-to individual in a crisis.

The Programmer is fiercely independent and self-reliant, despite his tendency to lead others. He sports a purple cap with a headset, which he prefers to keep on his head at all times. His accented attire includes a red scarf to keep him warm in the chilly nights of his urban setting, as well as a whistle - a tool he uses to call attention when he needs it.

The Programmer's unique appearance and skill make him a sight to be admired or feared, depending on who you ask. Nevertheless, he is a valued member of the urban fantasy world, always ready to lend his intelligence and natural leadership to those who need it. He is to be approached with respect and caution, as his primary role is to observe and protect the Order from outside threats.
