ID # : DSC-MATE-9338
Item #9338, also known as "The Real Estate Agent," is a Human male with peculiar features. His face is covered in spots that seem to shimmer in the light, while his mouth is in a permanent state of fright, as if he has just encountered a monster.

His blue clown eyes, which glimmer brightly, add to his bizarre appearance. His head resembles that of a monk, while his ears are adorned with a jade earring. He is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck, and an LED gas mask that conceals his mouth and nose.

The Real Estate Agent has been known to exhibit absent-mindedness and forgetfulness on occasion, particularly when he is deep in thought or working on a project. This has led to some comical situations, such as missing appointments or forgetting important dates.

Despite his quirks, The Real Estate Agent is a capable salesperson, using his unique appearance to his advantage to close deals. However, it is advised to approach him with caution, as he may inadvertently cause chaos due to his absent-minded nature.
