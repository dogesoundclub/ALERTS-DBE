Description:

DSC-MATE-805 is a male monkey, with horned rim glasses and green hair in a purple cap. He often wears a gold chain and an LED gas mask. DSC-MATE-805 is employed as a programmer, and possesses a remarkable talent for programming and software development.

DSC-MATE-805 has a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Despite not considering himself the life of the party, he has a talent for delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. DSC-MATE-805 also possesses a strong work ethic and is highly dedicated to his programming work. He is eager to take on new challenges and projects, and strives to continually improve his skills.

DSC-MATE-805's intelligence and programming abilities have led to concerns that he may be capable of using his skills to breach containment. As such, strict security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to DSC-MATE-805's workstation and any relevant software or hardware. DSC-MATE-805 is also prohibited from communicating with any individuals outside of Foundation personnel, except under controlled circumstances.

No anomalous effects have been observed in DSC-MATE-805's programming work, and he has not demonstrated any hostile intentions towards Foundation personnel or otherwise. However, due to his potential capabilities and the unpredictable nature of anomalous entities, DSC-MATE-805 is to be monitored closely for any signs of aberrant behavior or ability.
