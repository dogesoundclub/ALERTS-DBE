ID # : DSC-MATE-445
Subject 445 is a curious specimen indeed. A human male, identified as a doctor, with an unusual appearance to match. What catches the eye first is his unique mouth spot, almost resembling a birthmark, but with an irregular shape. Coupled with his ever-present smile, it gives one the impression of a constant amusement.

But that is just the beginning. The eyes shine with a virtual rainbow of LED lights, set in such a way as to hypnotize the onlooker if they gaze too long. The bucket hat on his head seems to be a permanent fixture, providing a sense of comfort to the doctor. Yet, the forehead goggle adds an air of mystery to his overall appearance, hinting at some hidden purpose.

The silver chain and candy stick, both carried as accessories, give off a child-like vibe. Strangely innocent and charming when compared to the appearance and profession of the doctor.

However, one must keep in mind their impulsive nature. This unpredictable personality leaves those around them on edge, never quite sure what might happen next. Yet, it is precisely this trait that makes the doctor so fascinating. Their spontaneity leads to unexpected decisions that can either make one laugh or catch one off guard.

Subject 445 is undoubtedly a unique individual, and their presence in any situation is bound to make it more interesting. Proceed with caution, but do not hesitate to engage in conversation. You never know what you might learn from the doctor, or what he may learn from you.
