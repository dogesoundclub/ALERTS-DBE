Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1385 is to be monitored at all times and is to be kept under strict surveillance in order to prevent an incident. Any personnel with a history of aggression or hostility are to be prohibited from interacting with 1385.

Description:

Subject 1385 appears to be a humanoid of the female variety. While visually indistinguishable from any average member of their species, 1385 possesses a set of unconventional features that sets them apart from most humans. Their eyes are fitted with VR jade LED technology and their ears are adorned with green cross earrings. 1385 also exudes an air of natural charm and charisma that can often make them the center of attention. 

The main anomaly associated with 1385, however, is their ability to induce euphoria in those around them. This is caused by an unknown means of biological manipulation that causes the brains of individuals to release dopamine at unprecedented levels. This effect has been seen to last long after 1385 has left the area, suggesting a prolonged exposure effect.

In addition to this, 1385 has been known to engage in humorous activities including telling jokes and performing silly dances. However, caution must be taken with interactions with 1385 as they have demonstrated a sharp wit and a keen sense of manipulation. 

It is currently unknown what 1385's motivations are and how they came to possess their abilities. Continued observation is necessary to determine the extent of 1385's powers and potential effects on other individuals.
