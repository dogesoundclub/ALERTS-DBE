Item #: 4619

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 4619 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-19, with CCTV monitoring at all times. The chamber must be soundproofed to prevent any communication beyond the subject's cell. Access to the chamber must be granted only for designated personnel.

Description:
Subject 4619 is a male human news anchor from WKYV News in ███████, with various anomalous characteristics. His face exhibits orange stripes and a clown mouth with blue clown eyes, while his head appears to be made of purple metal. The subject's ears are pierced, with a jade earring in his left ear. He is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

The subject has an anomalous personality trait that leads him to exhibit an excessive level of care and nurturing towards inanimate objects, a condition generally termed "anthropomorphization." Subject 4619 has been known to name his car and talk to his plants and household appliances as if they were sentient beings. 

The subject is a skilled communicator and has been observed convincing several of his interviewees to confess or share information they otherwise would not release. It is unknown if this is an effect of his persona or if it is due to suspect interactions or lack of recording equipment during interviews. His news reports are typically well-received among his fans and viewers.

It has been reported that contaminating a subject's home with a substance that smells of metal and/or burned comestible, similar to the smell of grilled or toasted bread, may show a suppressive effect on the subject's unusual behavior for a minimum of twenty hours. Further testing is pending to verify this effect. 

Addendum 4619.1:
After a series of interviews with Subject ████ regarding his anomalous personality trait, it was discovered that he has an alternate personality triggered by exposure to low-frequency sound waves, reported to sound similar to a metal-hitting or industrial grinding sound at high volumes. When triggered, the subject's anomalous personality is suppressed, and the subject displays a different persona with no anomalous characteristics. However, use of this technique for containment is restricted, as exposure to low-frequency sound waves can be detrimental to the subject's health.
