Subject 5913 is a human male with a rather unusual appearance. Their most striking feature are the ski goggle-like eyes that appear to have a faint glow to them. Furthermore, their head is adorned with a voluminous mohawk, lending them a rough rebellious style. On their forehead, there's a pair of goggles, ostensibly to protect their eyes from debris during their work.

As for their ears, they are decorated with a pair of green cross earrings adding a hint of if not religious, then spiritual association. Perhaps even more intriguing are the various silver chains which adorn their neck, adding a layer of mystery to their overall appearance.

Despite their striking appearance, subject 5913's true nature lies in their deep curiosity about the world. They have an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and they relish learning about obscure or unusual things. Sometimes, to the amusement or frustration of others, they will randomly spout off trivial or arcane pieces of information without any provocation.

Due to their natural curiosity, their profession as a reporter is no surprise, as they are always seeking to unearth the truth and shine a light on the hidden aspects of things. Under careful observation and controlled use, they could prove to be a valuable asset to certain agencies and organizations that are in need of individuals with a knack for digging beneath the surface.
