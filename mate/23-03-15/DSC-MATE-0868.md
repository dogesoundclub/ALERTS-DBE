ID # : DSC-MATE-868
DSC-MATE-868, also known as "Officer Hopper," is a male rabbit of unknown origin. He currently serves as a Traffic Officer for the Foundation, monitoring and controlling the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic around its premises. Despite his diminutive size, DSC-MATE-868 is a skilled and effective enforcer, known for his fearless pursuit of safety and order in even the most chaotic of situations.

DSC-MATE-868's most striking feature is his pair of bright, red clown eyes, which seem to exude a sense of gravity and authority that belies his adorable appearance. His head is not arranged in a conventional way, instead being a chaotic mass of green fur that clumps and tangles in unpredictable ways. His forehead features a distinctive two-color band of fur, which serves as his unique identifier.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of DSC-MATE-868's appearance are his jade earrings, which hang from his large, floppy ears. These earrings are believed to possess some form of anomalous properties, as they have been observed to emit a faint, mystical glow when DSC-MATE-868 is in close proximity to other anomalous entities or objects.

DSC-MATE-868 is also rarely without his signature silver chain, which he wears around his neck at all times. This chain is of unknown origin and purpose, but it is rumored among Foundation personnel that it may contain some form of mystical power or protection.

In addition to his jewelry, DSC-MATE-868 is also known to carry a standard-issue Foundation whistle, which he utilizes to great effect in managing traffic and crowds. His personality is one of order and control, as he is highly organized and efficient in his work. While this can sometimes come across as controlling or overbearing, he is generally well-liked by his colleagues and is a valued member of the Foundation's security team.
