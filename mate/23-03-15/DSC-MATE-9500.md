DogeSoundClub Containment Report 9500:

Subject 9500 is formally identified as a human female train driver. They possess a natural charisma and charm that can make them incredibly likable and entertaining in social situations. This trait can be advantageous, but must be monitored closely in case it attracts unwanted attention or leads to aberrant behavior.

9500 has distinct facial features that distinguish them from other humans. Their most prominent facial feature is their purple-colored lips, which is strange but not harmful. More concerning are 9500's striking red clown eyes, which can cause anxiety and even terror in those who meet them.

Their head appears to be perpetually disarranged, presenting as a wild and unkempt green coloration. Their ears feature a pair of jade earrings, which, while visually pleasing, serve no seemingly supernatural purpose.

Due to the possible negative effects of their clown eyes and distinctive appearance, 9500 wears a medical mask over their mouth as they interact with others. This has been noted to mitigate negative reactions from those around them.

In addition to their unique features, 9500 wears a choker as an accessory. The purpose of this item is unknown and requires further investigation.

Subject 9500 is largely cooperative with Foundation personnel and maintains a pleasant demeanor. However, their natural charm and charisma can sometimes lead them to make jokes or engage in foolish behavior at inappropriate times. Continued observation is advised.

Overall, despite their unusual appearance, 9500's species classification remains that of a human, and no anomalous abilities have been observed to date. Nonetheless, their case is being monitored continually to assess any potential supernatural abilities or threats. Further testing and analysis are ongoing.
