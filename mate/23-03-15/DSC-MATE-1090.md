ID # : DSC-MATE-1090
DSC-MATE-1090, codenamed "The Farmer," is a female human with striking features that immediately catch the eye. Her red lips contrast sharply with her metal blue head, which gives her an almost robotic appearance. The blue color of her head seems to radiate a faint energy field, but attempts to study it have provided inconclusive results.

The most notable feature of DSC-MATE-1090, however, is her blue clown eyes. These eyes are unsettling to most observers and have an unnerving effect on those who meet her gaze. Additionally, she sports a red cross earring and a gold chain, which seem to hold a special value to her.

DSC-MATE-1090's personality is characterized by a strong sense of organization and efficiency, which sometimes borders on being obsessive. While this trait can be an asset in certain situations, it can also lead to her being perceived as controlling or domineering. Despite this, she often takes charge of group projects or events and excels at delegating tasks to others.

It is unknown how DSC-MATE-1090 came into possession of her unique appearance or abilities. Further study is required to fully understand the extent of her capabilities and any potential threats she may pose to society. As a result, she is to be closely monitored at all times.
