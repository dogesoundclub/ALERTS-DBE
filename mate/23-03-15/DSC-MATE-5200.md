ID # : DSC-MATE-5200
Subject 5200, also known as "The Joker," is a human male currently employed as a train driver. He stands out with his most noticeable facial feature - a series of mysterious spots scattered across his face, making him an easy target for double takes and curious stares. His red clown eyes, painted across the white of his eyes, only add to his eccentric appearance. 

But beneath the visual oddities, there's something more peculiar about 5200. His head is encased in a series of green layers, each one seemingly a different hue of the same color, which he claims to have grown himself. His ears are pierced with a single gold earring, a reminder of his youthful days in a circus where he learned the art of clowning. 

Whenever he's not busy piloting locomotives, 5200 can usually be found puffing on a cigarette, sporting a grin from ear to ear. Despite the rather outlandish display of himself, he's a friendly individual who values social connections and harmony. But don't be surprised if you suddenly find yourself as his audience for a quick joke, or caught up in a playful banter. 

Though there is no evidence of any anomalous abilities associated with 5200, his peculiar physical appearance and erratic behavior warrant further investigation. As such, he has been placed under watchful observation, designated as a possible DSC candidate.
