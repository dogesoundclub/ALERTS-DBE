ID # : DSC-MATE-364
Subject #364 is a human female with distinct features. Their face is adorned with spots, and they always wear a wide smile that lights up their face. Their orange eyebrows frame their large, expressive eyes that seem to sparkle with joy and mischief. They have a head of hair reminiscent of 00s school girls, with layers and choppy bangs that never seem to get in their way.

The subject's ears are pierced and adorned with a singular red cross earring, which seems to be their only extravagance. They can often be seen wearing a gold chain around their neck, which appears to have some sentimental value to them.

Their job as a mechanic is an important aspect of their life, and they take their work very seriously. Subject #364 has a strong sense of responsibility and duty that they uphold in all aspects of their life. However, they know how to let loose and have fun when the situation allows it.

Their more carefree side can lead to amusing situations, particularly at social events, where they are prone to surprising others with their dance moves or playful antics. Beneath their lighthearted nature, however, lies a person with a depth of character that is uncommon in their line of work. Subject #364 is a well-rounded individual that should be approached with respect and caution.
