Description:

DSC-MATE-1000 is a human female politician, with distinctive red clown eyes and a pair of large wings on her head, blonde hair, and a pair of goggles worn on her forehead. DSC-MATE-1000 is also often seen wearing a red cross earring and a silver chain around her neck.

DSC-MATE-1000 possesses an anomalous effect that causes anyone who hears her voice to become extremely curious and eager to learn new information. DSC-MATE-1000 exhibits qualities of a knowledge seeker, constantly reading or researching obscure topics and collecting books, documentaries, and educational materials.

DSC-MATE-1000 is particularly interested in sharing her newfound knowledge with others, and will go to great lengths to do so. Her speeches and public appearances are generally well-received, as she is able to captivate her audience with her charisma and infectious passion for learning and discovery.

DSC-MATE-1000's anomalous effect is most potent when she is speaking or presenting information, but can also affect others in her vicinity, even when she is not actively engaging with them.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1000's anomalous effect was first discovered during a political rally in ██████, where several attendees began displaying a sudden and overwhelming desire to learn new information and share knowledge with others. Local authorities were initially suspicious of the sudden behavior change, but Foundation agents were able to identify DSC-MATE-1000 and contain her without incident.

Further research is ongoing to better understand the parameters and limitations of DSC-MATE-1000's anomalous effect, as well as any potential medical or psychological harm that may result from prolonged exposure.
