DSC-MATE-1408, also known as "The News Monkey", is a male simian creature with striking blue clown eyes that contrast with his brown fur. His head is adorned with a Doge hat, and a golden earring decorates each of his ears. He is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

While his appearance may seem comical, The News Monkey is a highly intelligent creature, possessing a natural charm and charisma that can make him the life of any gathering. He often uses this talent in his job as a news anchor, where his outgoing personality and infectious enthusiasm have made him a fan favorite among viewers.

However, The News Monkey's jovial nature belies a darker side. Reports suggest that he has been involved in a number of suspicious incidents, including the disappearance of fellow employees and the sabotage of rival news stations. While no concrete evidence has been found to support these claims, it is clear that The News Monkey is not to be underestimated.
