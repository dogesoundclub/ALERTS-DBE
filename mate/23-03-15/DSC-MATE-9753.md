9753 is a human female with distinct physical features. Her face is covered in spots and she wears bright red lipstick. Her eyebrows are an unusual shade of orange and her hair is cut short in a style reminiscent of a witch. Her forehead has two colored bands, and she wears gold earrings and a silver chain. To conceal her identity, she covers her mouth with a medical mask when in public.

Although 9753 may appear to be a typical human, she possesses a powerful ability to influence those around her. She possesses a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge in any situation.
