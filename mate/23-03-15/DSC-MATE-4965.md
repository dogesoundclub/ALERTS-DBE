ITEM #: 4965

OBJECT CLASS: HUMANOID

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: 

Subject 4965, also known as "The Mechanic," is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Security personnel are instructed to be mindful of his energetic nature, which has led to occasional outbursts or attempts to escape from containment. As of yet, none have been successful.

DESCRIPTION: 

Subject 4965 is a male human of average height and weight. His most notable physical feature is a pattern of spots across his face, which appear to be benign skin discolorations. He wears a medical mask over his mouth due to a respiratory condition which requires constant attention. He also sports a pair of nerd glasses and a headset with LED lighting, which he insists are necessary for his work as a mechanic. A pair of goggles rests atop his forehead at all times.

The Mechanic is known for his energetic and enthusiastic personality. He enjoys getting others excited about things, sometimes to the point of over-excitement. He can often be found tinkering with various pieces of machinery and discussing his latest projects or theories about their workings. Despite his friendly demeanor, he is easily frightened, which often manifests as a gaping, frightened mouth.

ACCESSORIES: 

Subject 4965 can often be seen wearing a red scarf, which he claims is a lucky charm. He insists on wearing it during all of his maintenance and repair work.

BEHAVIOR: 

The Mechanic tends towards fidgety or restless behavior when confined to his cell for extended periods of time. He has a tendency to chat enthusiastically with his captors, both about his work and personal interests. However, attempts to escape or breach containment have been noted in the past, which has led to an increase in security measures.

ADDENDUM:

Subject 4965's technical skills have proven invaluable in the repair and maintenance of onsite machinery. As such, he has been approved to work on a limited number of machines while under the watchful eye of on-duty security personnel.
