ID # : DSC-MATE-8059
Subject 8059 is a peculiar specimen, possessing features that are uncommon amongst the primate species. Its most distinct feature is its blood-red clown eyes that never seem to lose their unsettling glare. Its mouth is perennially twisted into a frightened expression, which creates a sense of unease and discomfort amongst those who interact with it.

Subject 8059 is known to be fiercely independent, never hesitating to challenge authority, and going against the rules that it deems unnecessary. These rebellious tendencies manifest themselves in its behaviour, with its whimsical escapades such as sneaking out of the office early or taking unauthorized leaves of absence.

Despite its rogue tendencies, Subject 8059 is a skilled programmer, with an impressive range of knowledge and expertise on computer systems. It is often noted for its sharp wit and dark sense of humour, traits that it uses to mask its fears and insecurities.

Subject 8059 is never seen without his red beanie, gold earring, and red scarf. It is also said to carry a whistle, which it uses to communicate with others of its kind. Its peculiar appearance and behaviour make it a fascinating subject for study amongst DSC researchers, with many attempting to unravel the mysteries of its monkey-like nature.
