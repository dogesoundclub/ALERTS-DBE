ID # : DSC-MATE-6111
DSC-MATE-6111, also known as "Officer Joy", is a human male traffic officer working within the urban limits. DSC-MATE-6111 presents with several unique physical features, including a distinctive dark spot on the right side of his mouth and a clown mouth on top of it where a traditional mouth would be. DSC-MATE-6111's eyes glow an ominous shade of red, resembling those of a clown. DSC-MATE-6111 wears a Doge hat that is adorned with a Jade earring, and his neck is adorned with a gold chain. What draws the most attention is the normal gas mask that DSC-MATE-6111 wears, which is mandatory due to his duties. However, DSC-MATE-6111 has been seen speaking to inanimate objects, such as his gas mask, and is known to anthropomorphize his household appliances, even going as far as naming his car. DSC-MATE-6111 is known to be extremely caring and nurturing and takes great care of his possessions. 

Agent observations indicate a possible link between these behaviors and a previously unidentified psychomancy ability, thus warranting further investigation. Nonetheless, DSC-MATE-6111's abilities have not posed a significant threat to the general public or DogeSoundClub operations, and therefore, no action has been taken. DSC-MATE-6111 is required to undergo periodic mental health evaluations for any abnormal psychological activity.
