Item #: 2558

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2558 is to be monitored at all times when on-air, all broadcasts are to be recorded and stored in the Foundation's archives. Any unusual behavior or breach of containment is to be immediately reported to Site-██.

Description:

Subject 2558, referred to as "The News Anchor," is a caucasian male of average height and build. The anomaly is distinguishable by his unique facial features, including orange stripes on his cheeks, and an ever-present smile. The subject is known to wear a bucket hat on his head and a jade earring on his left ear.

Subject 2558 exhibits a strong sense of intuition, making them appear as if they possess psychic powers. The news anchor can sense things before they happen and may even predict future events. They can also sense when someone is experiencing anxiety or discomfort, exhibiting an almost eerie capability to read emotions.

The subject is employed as a news anchor in a local news station, using his abilities to report on future events and predict the outcomes of events that would otherwise be subject to chance.

Despite the seemingly benign nature of this anomaly, it is imperative to control the extent of the news anchor's influence on the general public. As such, Foundation personnel must take appropriate measures to monitor and contain subject 2558.

Addendum:

Note: All broadcasts of Subject 2558 are mandatory viewing for all Foundation personnel stationed near Site-██.

-Dr. █████████, Site-██ Director.
