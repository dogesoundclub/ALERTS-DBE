ID # : DSC-MATE-8018
Subject 8018, also known as "Spike", is a unique specimen of the human species. His most notable feature is the orange stripes that adorn his face, a result of a rare mutation that occurred during his embryonic development. Along with the unusual markings, 8018 has VR Jade LED eyes that glow in the dark and a sharp peak spike on the top of his head. 

As a security guard, Spike takes his duty seriously, always on the lookout for perceived threats. He wears a gold chain around his neck and sports a gold earring in one ear, hinting at a love for material possessions. Perhaps as an attempt to calm his nerves, the subject can often be seen with a cigarette between his lips. 

Despite his fierce exterior, Spike has a soft spot for emotional moments, finding himself moved to tears by sentimental movies or TV shows. He possesses a fondness for music and art that evokes strong feelings, nodding his head in appreciation and enjoying the moment. 

Subject 8018 is to be monitored at all times, as his unique features and personality could be of interest to outside parties. In the event of any anomalies, report immediately to the assigned supervisor for further action.
