Subject 3491, alias "Bugsy", is a peculiar creature to say the least. Assigned as a real estate agent, the esteemed position reflects his affable character that puts many humans to shame. But beware, for beneath the fluff and easy-going nature, lies a fierce protector.

Appearing as an ordinary rabbit, save for the blue clown eyes, those who dare to look into them will find themselves shrinking away in inexplicable fear. The frightened mouth only adds to the unsettling appearance, but Bugsy is quick to disarm any panic with a laid-back attitude and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.

Behind the two-color band on his forehead, is a mind that has weathered many burrows and tunnels, a testament to his experience and street smarts. Don't let the cigarette dangling from his lips fool you, for he has the wisdom to navigate the most treacherous of deals.

As a true friend and ally, Bugsy will not hesitate to leap to the defense of those he loves. Woe betides anyone who tries to harm or insult his friends or family, as they will have to face the brunt of his ferocity.

Handle with caution, for Bugsy may seem like a cute little rabbit, but he's got enough tricks and guile up his sleeves to make anyone think twice.
