DSC-MATE-3721 is a female human of indeterminate age, with striking orange stripes stretching across her face. Her lips are a vivid purple shade, drawing attention to the LED-enhanced VR jade-colored eyes that appear to glow with an inner light. A gold tiara sits atop her head, while a pair of goggles rests casually on her forehead. Delicate golden earrings glint in the light as she moves, and a thick gold chain hangs from her neck.

Her natural curiosity and inventive nature make her a valuable asset to any team, as she is constantly brainstorming new and innovative ideas to improve situations.

However, her tendency towards outlandish solutions can cause some confusion and amusement among those around her, as she throws out ideas that range from practical to impossible. Despite this, DSC-MATE-3721 remains a valuable member of any team, bringing a unique perspective and always thinking outside the box.
