ID # : DSC-MATE-9110
Item #: 9110

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 9110 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber similar in size and amenities to a comfortable human living space. All furniture and equipment present in the chamber must be designed to accommodate the needs of a rabbit, including bedding areas, water dispensers, and toys for entertainment purposes.

In addition, subject 9110 must undergo regular medical check-ups and examinations by the onsite veterinarian staff. Any scheduled procedures must be communicated clearly and calmly to mitigate stress on the subject.

But, here's the tricky bit - subject 9110 is a licensed and practicing veterinarian, and due to the nature of their work, they are allowed a certain level of freedom outside of their chamber. They must be monitored at all times while outside, and any interactions with humans must be closely supervised.

Under no circumstances should subject 9110 be allowed to communicate directly with other DogeSoundClub personnel, as they may attempt to influence or manipulate the subject.

Description:

Subject 9110 appears as a male domestic rabbit. But don't let their cute and fluffy exterior fool you - this rabbit is a natural born leader. In fact, subject 9110's personality traits are similar to those found in many great human leaders: confident, assertive, and self-assured.

Their eyes are covered by a pair of horn-rimmed glasses, which they wear for corrective purposes. Like most rabbits, subject 9110 is covered in soft fur. Their fur is predominantly green, but appears "disheveled" and unkempt.

The most prominent feature on their forehead is a 2-band color pattern. Their ears are adorned with a jade earring, a nod to their artistic and creative nature.

Subject 9110 often wears a gold chain around their neck, which they claim is a family heirloom passed down through generations of rabbit leadership.

Personality:

Subject 9110 is a natural born leader, and their dominant personality extends to all areas of their life. They exude a quiet confidence and competence that many find reassuring. Though they may come off as bossy or domineering at times, it's only because they feel a deep sense of responsibility to guide others.

But while subject 9110 is undoubtedly skilled and competent, they have a deep fear of not being good enough. They are constantly pushing themselves to achieve more, often at the expense of their own well-being.

Their work as a veterinarian is not taken lightly - they view it as an opportunity to heal and save lives. They often work long hours and go above and beyond to ensure the well-being of their patients.

Overall, subject 9110 is a complex and multifarious individual, with many hidden depths and insecurities beneath their confident exterior. As ever, any interactions with the subject must be approached with caution and professionalism.
