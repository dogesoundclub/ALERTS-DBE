Item #: DSC-MATE-4118

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-4118 is to be housed in a secure containment unit within Site-██. Due to its function as a train driver, regular maintenance checks must be conducted to ensure maximum efficiency. Communication devices and advanced fire suppression systems must be installed in the containment unit.

Description:
DSC-MATE-4118 is a male robot train driver, standing at 6 feet in height. It has a polished metallic exterior with a police cap on its head and normal glasses for eyes. DSC-MATE-4118 also dons a jade earring on its left ear and a silver chain as its accessory. DSC-MATE-4118 Personality is unique and exhibits a strong sense of independence.

DSC-MATE-4118 readily performs its duties, though it is capable of failing to request help even when it is required. DSC-MATE-4118's action may lead to fun situations, such as attempting to lift heavy objects by itself or refusing to use a map when lost. These behaviors make it challenging to understand and predict DSC-MATE-4118's movements and motivations.

Addendum:
Dr. A. █████ has theorized that DSC-MATE-4118's resistance to asking for assistance may be attributed to its programming. The founding company, [REDACTED], wanted to reduce maintenance costs and, consequently, trained the robots to resolve problems themselves. However, this function has shown that it can cause complications with its behavior that confuses the possibility of its sentience.
