ID # : DSC-MATE-614
DSC-MATE-614, also known as "The Monkey Lawyer", is a male simian creature with a striking appearance that leaves an impression on anyone who encounters him. His frightened mouth suggests a perpetual sense of unease, while his horned rim glasses give him an air of sophistication and intelligence.

His head is adorned with a wild shock of green hair, held in place by a purple cap that adds a touch of whimsy to his overall look. Dangling from one of his ears is a gold earring, adding a hint of bling to his ensemble.

For additional flair, he wears a red scarf, wrapped around his neck and tucked neatly into his crisp suit jacket. This accessory calls to mind a fashion-savvy human, rather than a member of his particular species.

Despite his comical appearance, DSC-MATE-614 is no laughing matter in the courtroom. As a skilled lawyer, he is renowned for his quick wit and love of debate, often engaging in playful arguments with friends and family members just for fun.

However, it is important to note that The Monkey Lawyer is not to be underestimated. Reports suggest that he has the ability to manipulate and influence those around him, utilizing his charm and quick thinking to achieve his desired outcome.

Handle with caution.
