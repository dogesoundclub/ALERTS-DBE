ID # : DSC-MATE-3300
DSC-MATE-3300, codenamed "The Stylish Pup," is a male human beautician with distinct orange stripes on his face. The subject's most notable facial feature, however, is his constant smile, which seems to be plastered across his face at all times. DSC-MATE-3300 appears to have normal eyesight and wears regular glasses, which do not seem to impede his abilities in any way.

DSC-MATE-3300's head is adorned with a "Doge Hat," which appears to be made from some sort of synthetic fabric. The design depicts a cartoonish representation of a dog's head, replete with floppy ears, a pink tongue, and a wide, goofy grin. DSC-MATE-3300's own ears are accented with a jade earring, which seems to be a cherished possession.

Finally, DSC-MATE-3300 wears a silver chain that is looped around his neck and secured with a simple clasp. The chain itself does not appear to serve any practical purpose, though the subject is often seen fiddling with it absentmindedly.

DSC-MATE-3300's true power, however, lies in their quick wit and love for debate. He appears to be an expert at verbal sparring, and is often able to argue someone into a corner with ease. DSC-MATE-3300 has a habit of engaging in playful arguments with friends and family members just for fun, causing many to underestimate his true intellectual capabilities.

It is currently unknown how DSC-MATE-3300's unique appearance and personality traits came to be, and further research is required to determine if there are any anomalous qualities to his abilities. Until then, DSC-MATE-3300 will continue to be monitored and studied by the Foundation.
