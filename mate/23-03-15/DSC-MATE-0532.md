Subject 532, also known as "The Caretaker," is a human male with a unique appearance. His face is speckled with spots, reminiscent of a fawn's coat. His eyes are covered by ski goggles, making it difficult to discern what he is looking at. On top of his head, he wears a police cap, suggesting a sense of justice and order. The most striking feature, however, are the Jade earrings he wears on his ears, giving him an air of mystery.

Despite his peculiar appearance, The Caretaker is a kind and nurturing person. He shows empathy not only towards other people but towards inanimate objects as well. It is not uncommon for him to give his car a name or to talk to his plants. Some rumors even suggest that he has anthropomorphized his household appliances. 

However, his caring nature does not make him weak. On the contrary, The Caretaker is a skilled programmer, able to navigate the complicated world of code with ease. He often uses his skills to help others, offering to fix their computers or create software that makes their life easier. 

Although he may seem aloof or detached, The Caretaker is a valuable ally in the war against supernatural beings. His strong sense of justice and caring nature make him a force to be reckoned with. Any organization or team would be fortunate to have such an asset on their side.
