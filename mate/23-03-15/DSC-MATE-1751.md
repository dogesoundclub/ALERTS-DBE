DSC-MATE-1751 Background:

DSC-MATE-1751 was initially tracked by the Foundation after it was recognized that her on-camera appearances caused cognitive and mental health effects linked to her appearance. Subjects that watched her in any situations were struck with an alarming drop in serotonin levels, leading to depression, leading to self-harm or even death. 

DSC-MATE-1751's containment reduces the objective amount of on-camera appearances she can make, which limits stress and saves the public from potentially harmful depression sources. While monitoring, DSC-MATE-1751 was found to be capable of broadcasting thoughts, which makes DSC-MATE-1751 highly dangerous whenever she has access to media broadcasting equipment. Prolonged monitoring leads to sleep deprivation for the DSC-MATE-1751 staff, so regular medical evaluations are recommended.
