ID # : DSC-MATE-7778
Security Classification: Euclid

Subject 7778, codenamed "The Multi-Tasker", is a male human of unknown age, appearing to be in his mid-30s. He stands at an average height with a lean build, and is often seen sporting a sly grin on his face, revealing his perfectly aligned teeth. His most noticeable feature is his VR Rainbow LED eyes, which constantly flash with different colors.

The subject is always seen wearing a blue bandana on his head, with his dark hair falling in messy locks around his shoulders. He also has a green cross earring on his left earlobe. The subject is often seen with a cigarette hanging between his lips, emitting a faint smoke trail around him.

Subject 7778 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on multiple tasks at once. He prides himself on being able to handle anything thrown his way, but this has also led to him often stretching himself too thin. He can be seen frantically trying to fit all his tasks into a single day, or carrying an excessive amount of things at once.

Despite his quirks, Subject 7778 is an unpredictable villain that should not be underestimated. His charming smile and casual demeanor should not detract from his dangerous nature. It is recommended to approach with caution, as his abilities are not to be taken lightly.
