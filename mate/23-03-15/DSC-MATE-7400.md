Subject 7400, codenamed "Hopper" is a remarkable specimen of the urban fantasy universe. As a police officer, Hopper brings a unique perspective to law enforcement due to their classification as a rabbit. Sporting a purple cap with a headset and horned rim glasses, Hopper is always on the scene, ready to take control of any situation that comes their way.

One can quickly discern that Hopper is a type-A personality, extremely organized and efficient, with a tendency to take charge of group projects and events. Although this trait can occasionally come across as controlling, it often leads to humorous situations where Hopper delegates tasks to others in a matter-of-fact way.

Despite their diminutive size, Hopper is an invaluable asset to the police department, often using their agility and speed to their advantage in high-pressure situations. Additionally, the presence of a cigarette is prevalent, although it should be noted that smoking is not recommended for any species.

As volatile as the urban fantasy universe can be, Hopper remains steadfast in their duties, bringing their unique perspective and unwavering composure to every crime scene. Subject 7400 proves the adage, "big things come in small packages."
