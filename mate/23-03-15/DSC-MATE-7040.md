DSC-MATE-7040 is a formidable mafia boss, feared and respected by her colleagues and rivals alike. Her human exterior is distinguished by orange stripes on her face, contrasting with purple lips that add to her enigmatic aura. Her piercing orange eyebrows remind witnesses of a predator's gaze, evocative of both cunning and menace. DSC-MATE-7040 also wears a tiara atop her head, accentuating her regal stature within the criminal underworld.

Her throaty voice, however, hints at an underlying power and cunning that rival that of her male counterparts in the mafia's hierarchy. She also wears a gold chain as her primary accessory, emphasizing her wealth and social status.
