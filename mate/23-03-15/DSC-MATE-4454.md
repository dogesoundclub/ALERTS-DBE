ID # : DSC-MATE-4454
DSC-MATE-4454, codenamed "The Banker", is a male tiger of unknown origin. His distinctive features include a pair of green-tinted goggles on his forehead, and a gold earring dangling from each ear. He is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck.

But what truly sets DSC-MATE-4454 apart from other tigers are his accessories. The Banker possesses a highly advanced LED gas mask that obscures his facial features and provides him with a distinct advantage in dimly lit environments.

Despite his intimidating appearance, DSC-MATE-4454 has been observed to possess a playful side, readily sharing humorous stories and jokes with those who show him respect. However, DSC-MATE-4454 also values tradition and may exhibit a no-nonsense attitude towards those who do not follow his strict code of conduct.

Despite repeated attempts at communication with DSC-MATE-4454, the creature remains unforthcoming, exhibiting a clear distrust of Foundation personnel. However, his mastery of the English language suggests that he may have had some previous contact with human society.
