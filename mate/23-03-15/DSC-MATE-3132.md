ID # : DSC-MATE-3132
Subject 3132 is a human female with striking features that are both alarming and perplexing. Her most notable attribute is her red clown eyes, which stare out from beneath a raised brow. Her forehead is adorned with a goggle that seem to serve no purpose, except perhaps to intimidate others.

Subject 3132's ears are pierced with red cross earrings, which appear to be in conflict with the rest of her eccentric appearance. Despite her strange physical features, Subject 3132 is a security guard by trade, and fulfills her role with an unmovable focus.

The subject's personality is quite curious. She is known to be impulsive, often engaging in daredevil activities on a whim. Her tendency to take risks has resulted in many humorous situations, such as jumping off cliffs into rivers without a second thought.

Subject 3132 wears a gold chain, which is a stark contrast to the rest of her attire. It is unknown if it holds any significance or purpose, but the subject seems to wear it with pride.

Approach with caution, as Subject 3132's erratic behavior and unusual appearance could suggest a much deeper, hidden motive.
