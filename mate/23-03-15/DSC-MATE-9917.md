Subject 9917, also known as "Dr. Simian," is a male monkey of unknown origin. Donned in a red scarf and brandishing a normal gas mask, no one knows what he's hiding from or what secrets he sees through his VR rainbow LED eyes.

A renowned veterinarian, Dr. Simian's curiosity never satiates. His love for adventure and thrill-seeking often leads him into danger, such as surviving a failed bungee jump or getting stranded in the forests for days.

Despite his make-believe bravado, Dr. Simian has proven his worth in the field of medicine with his unmatched knowledge and skills, making him sought after by both human and paranormal creatures alike. Just don't be surprised if he responds mid-surgery or consultation with "ooh-ooh ah-ah."
