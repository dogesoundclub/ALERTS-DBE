Subject 221, known as "The Train Man," is a human male with unique features that make him stand out from the rest of society. His face is adorned with a sprinkling of spots, giving him the appearance of a leopard on the prowl. However, it's his head that truly sets him apart, as his messy green hair seems to have a mind of its own, refusing to be tamed.

The Train Man is a train driver by profession, but he also has an affinity for all things locomotive. He wears a pair of goggles on his forehead, always ready to inspect the machinery of any train he comes across. His ears are adorned with a single gold earring, a symbol of his love for the railway.

His signature accessory is a red scarf that he wears around his neck, which billows in the wind as he drives his train. And if that wasn't enough to catch your attention, he also wears an LED gas mask, which glows in the dark and provides him with a constant source of fresh air.

Despite his unique appearance, The Train Man's personality is what truly sets him apart. He's a ball of energy, always enthusiastic and eager to share his passion for trains with anyone who will listen. His excitement can sometimes get the better of him, leading him to overreact to things that others may not find particularly interesting.

However, when it comes to trains, The Train Man's passion is contagious. His enthusiasm is so infectious that even the most hardened cynics find themselves getting caught up in his love for all things locomotive.
