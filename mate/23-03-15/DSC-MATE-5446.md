ID # : DSC-MATE-5446
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 5446 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with additional amenities to accommodate its species. Subject is allowed access to a computer terminal and is permitted to take breaks for physical activity in a controlled environment. Any emotional distress caused by media or art will be addressed by on-site mental health specialists.

Description:
Subject 5446 appears to be a cogent, sentient male monkey with a taste for technology. Its head is adorned with a bucket hat and horned rim glasses that appear to be purely cosmetic in nature. A silver chain is often worn around its neck, though it serves no apparent purpose. 

Subject 5446 is generally cooperative with requests from researchers and has been trained to perform programming tasks with proficiency. However, it displays a notable degree of emotional sensitivity, often becoming emotional during sentimental moments in media or when in the presence of art that evokes strong emotions. 

Additional testing is required to determine the extent of its emotional range and its impact on its programming abilities. Furthermore, it is recommended that researchers take care not to expose 5446 to media that may overwhelm its emotional capacity. 

Conclusion:
As a Euclid-class object, Subject 5446 is considered a moderate risk to the safety of Foundation personnel. Its anomalous nature requires constant monitoring and testing to fully understand the extent of its abilities and limitations. As such, containment measures must be maintained to ensure the safety and well-being of all personnel involved.
