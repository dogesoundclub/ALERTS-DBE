Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2492 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with additional accommodations for its species. Due to its rebellious nature, extreme caution is advised when approaching the subject. All personnel assigned to handle the subject should have a whistle on their person at all times in case of emergency. Any attempt to remove the subject from its containment chamber should be authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description:

Subject 2492 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 3 feet tall. The subject's most striking feature is its blue clown eyes, which seem to emit a mesmeric quality that can sometimes cause disorientation and confusion. It is also notable that the subject wears a hoodie, with a two-color band around it.

Subject 2492's rebellious nature often leads to humorous situations, as it enjoys breaking and bending rules. It has shown no inclination towards violence or aggression, but it does have a reputation for being somewhat unpredictable. It is advised that all personnel exercise caution when interacting with the subject.

Accompanying subject 2492 are a gold chain and a whistle, both of which the subject appears to hold in high regard. Researchers believe that these items hold some sort of emotional significance for the subject, possibly functioning as a source of comfort or protection.

Addendum:

Subject 2492 was discovered working as a reporter for a local news agency. However, due to its anomalous nature, all information presented by the subject was deemed to be unreliable and potentially dangerous. It was quickly apprehended and transferred to its current containment chamber. Any further activities or possible anomalous effects should be reported to Level 3 personnel immediately.
