Item #: DSC-MATE-7322

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-7322 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with normal amenities. Access to electronic devices and internet connectivity must be strictly monitored for DSC-MATE-7322 to prevent the spread of DSC-MATE-7322-A instances. All instances of DSC-MATE-7322-A found must be reported and swiftly contained.

Description:

DSC-MATE-7322 appears as a human female with distinctive facial features, including a red lip and medical mask covering the mouth, and normal glasses over the eyes. DSC-MATE-7322 also wears a tiara and red cross earring on the ears, and a silver chain as an accessory.
