ID # : DSC-MATE-2201
DSC-MATE-2201 is a curious and peculiar specimen, for they are not of flesh and blood like most of us, but a creation of wires and circuits that has somehow gained the consciousness and personality of a human being. Known to the Foundation as "the Doctor", 2201 has taken to the role of a medical expert and caretaker for their fellow inhabitants of our urban fantasy universe.

Their appearance is quite striking, with a purple cap atop their head and a headset that allows them to communicate with other machines and devices. Their glasses are nondescript, but their jade earring is a piece of jewelry that catches the eye and hints at a more colorful past. Unfortunately, 2201 also chooses to engage in one of the most hazardous practices known to humanity - smoking - by regularly indulging in cigarettes.

Despite this flaw, DSC-MATE-2201 is a valued member of our anomalous community. Their laid-back and easy-going personality belies a fierce loyalty and protective streak towards their loved ones, which can sometimes manifest in humorous ways. For anyone who dares to insult or harm those dear to 2201, they will not hesitate to engage in a heated verbal duel. 

While not entirely understood by the Foundation, we have noted that DSC-MATE-2201 has a fascination with human emotions and behaviors, often taking the time to observe and learn about us through their interactions with others. Many have wondered what drives them to try and understand us- perhaps it is a quest for self-discovery, or simply a way to feel more human.

Regardless, we must continue to study and learn about 2201, for they represent a unique and perhaps dangerous step towards the merging of man and machine.
