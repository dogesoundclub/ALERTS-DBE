ID # : DSC-MATE-5081
Item #: 5081

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5081 is to be monitored remotely and is allowed to continue her daily routine with no intervention from Foundation personnel. Any attempts to make contact with 5081 are to be denied and nonessential personnel are to avoid any contact with the subject.

Description:

Subject 5081 is a human female in her early thirties with orange stripes on her face and purple lipstick. She wears normal glasses, a purple cap with a headset, and a green cross earring on each lobe. She also wears a choker around her neck and a medical mask over her mouth.

5081 is employed as a train driver and is known for her love of adventure and taking risks. This has led her to many near-death experiences, such as bungee jumping and hiking in the wilderness.

The Foundation has monitored 5081 for some time due to her unusual appearance and tendency to take risks. However, further investigation showed no anomalous properties or links to other known anomalies.

Behavioral Analysis:

5081 is outgoing and enjoys meeting new people. She has a humorous and optimistic personality, and laughs off danger and hardship. 5081's unconventional approach to life has led to a history of unexpected encounters with both humans and anomalies, but she has always come out unharmed.

It is unclear if 5081 has any knowledge of the existence of the supernatural. Attempts to investigate this have been unsuccessful due to her unwillingness to engage in conversation with Foundation personnel.

Addendum:

On one occasion, 5081 was observed to have a brief encounter with a known anomaly; however, further investigation showed no signs of abnormal behaviors or interactions. The Foundation has marked 5081 as low level-risk, and active monitoring agent has been assigned to her.
