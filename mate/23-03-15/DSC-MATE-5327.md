DSC-MATE-5327 is a human male and an anomaly residing within our organization serving as a security guard. His unique features are hard to miss, as his face is marked with spots and a frightened mouth, with eyes that resemble those of a clown; colored a deep, alarming red. However, his most unusual feature is the Doge Hat he wears over his head, which we have been unable to remove. DSC-MATE-5327 also has a two-color band on his forehead and a single, jade earring on each ear.

Despite these peculiar characteristics, DSC-MATE-5327's personality is his most fascinating trait. He has a deep empathy and sense of understanding for others, often becoming emotional when he witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. His fondness for animals and nature has been noted on several occasions and is often seen tending to the plants in the facility's garden.

Therefore, strict protocols are in place for his assignments, including regular counseling sessions with our psychologist. DSC-MATE-5327's willingness to help and protect those around him is a unique asset, and we will continue to monitor and observe his behavior carefully.
