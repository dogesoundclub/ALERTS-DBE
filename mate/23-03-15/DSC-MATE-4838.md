**Item #:** 4838

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** DSC-MATE-4838 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. The chamber must be equipped with a sufficient supply of various tools and technological devices that the subject may require for programming work. DSC-MATE-4838 is allowed recreational time, but only in designated areas during specified hours. Personnel are restricted from entering these recreational areas during DSC-MATE-4838's designated down time.

**Description:** DSC-MATE-4838 is a male monkey with parted pink hair, jade earrings, and a distinctive red scarf, who demonstrates exceptional programming skills. The subject is highly practical and creative, able to solve problems in unconventional ways while working with a variety of objects and materials that are not usually associated with programming. While DSC-MATE-4838 is capable of using modern technology and programming systems, the subject is known to make use of paper clips and duct tape to provide makeshift solutions to various complications. 

DSC-MATE-4838 has been noted as having an exceptional demand for cigarettes, being noted as constantly asking for "just one more cigarette". The subject's requests for cigarettes are to be limited, and monitored for possible negative effects on the subject's health.

**Addendum 1:** DSC-MATE-4838 has shown a particular interest in using technology to communicate with personnel, frequently engaging in conversation with those tasked with maintaining its containment. While DSC-MATE-4838's language is limited to that of a typical monkey, it has been observed mimicking the voices of those it communicates with. 

**Addendum 2:** DSC-MATE-4838 is encouraged to use the technology provided for programming and other recreational activities in order to maintain its mental and emotional health. It is noted that this may help prevent the subject from developing any anomalous abilities or behaviors as a result of long-term containment.
