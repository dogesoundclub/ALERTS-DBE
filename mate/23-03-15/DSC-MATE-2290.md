ID # : DSC-MATE-2290
DSC-MATE-2290 appears to be a humanoid robot, standing at six feet tall with a sleek silver body. Its most striking feature is the singular green cyclops eye in the center of its face, which is surrounded by a ski goggle-like apparatus. The mouth, always frozen in a frightened expression, is concealed by a medical mask, creating an unsettling contrast with the rest of the machine's calm exterior. Its head is adorned with a purple cap and a headset, indicating that it may work in a professional setting.

DSC-MATE-2290 is always seen wearing a silver chain around its neck and a gold earring adorns one of its metal ears. Despite its appearance, this robotic being possesses a personality that is quick-witted and argumentative, often engaging in playful debates with others for entertainment. Its love of debate has been known to cause humorous situations, although caution is advised when engaging it in conversation, as it has been known to become easily agitated. DSC-MATE-2290's occupation as a lawyer suggests that its advanced technology is capable of processing and analyzing complex information, making it a valuable asset in legal proceedings.
