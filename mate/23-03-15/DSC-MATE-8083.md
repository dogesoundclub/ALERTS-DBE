DSC-MATE-8083 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All requests for cosmetic procedures must be approved by at least one Level 2 researcher, and any materials brought in for use must be properly screened for potential anomalous properties.

Description:

DSC-MATE-8083 is a human male of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 174 cm tall and weighing approximately 77 kg. The subject's face is covered in small brown spots, with no apparent adverse effects on DSC-MATE-8083's health. DSC-MATE-8083's eyes are replaced with augmented reality jade LED technology, allowing for the subject to perceive additional information and give the appearance of glowing eyes. DSC-MATE-8083 frequently wears a police cap on their head, which they claim is for "branding purposes". DSC-MATE-8083 also wears a medical mask covering their mouth, claiming it to be a "health precaution".

DSC-MATE-8083 works as a beautician, specializing in hair and nail care. It is of note that DSC-MATE-8083 is competent in their work, and does not demonstrate any anomalous ability in their field. However, DSC-MATE-8083 frequently forgets appointments and appointments are necessary to be scheduled by the administration to prevent a breach of the facility.

DSC-MATE-8083 demonstrates an absent-minded and forgetful personality, particularly when working on projects. They have been known to lose track of time and miss important events. Interviews with the subject suggest that this is due to their mind being lost in thought, often focused on personal interests such as music and literature.

Addendum:

During routine screening, it was discovered that several of DSC-MATE-8083's cosmetic products had previously been owned by individuals with confirmed anomalous abilities. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-8083 had been unknowingly collecting these items from second-hand stores, and using them on clients. Though none of the items demonstrated any anomalous effects while in DSC-MATE-8083's possession, they have been placed under quarantine as a precautionary measure. Any attempts to retrieve the items from DSC-MATE-8083's possession have been met with confusion and non-compliance.
