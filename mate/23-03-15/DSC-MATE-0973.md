Dr. ██████: DSC-MATE-973, can you describe the origin of your red clown eyes?

DSC-MATE-973: (laughs) Oh, doc, if I could figure that out, I'd be a billionaire. I just woke up with 'em one day, thought it was some weird dream. But nope, here we are.

Dr. ██████: And your hair, it's not a natural color, correct?

DSC-MATE-973: Nope, just felt like changing things up. Looks good, right?

Dr. ██████: (pause) Have you ever exhibited any unexplainable abilities, DSC-MATE-973?

DSC-MATE-973: (leans forward) Now, why would you go and ask me that, doc? You think I'm hiding something?

Dr. ██████: I'm just asking for the record, DSC-MATE-973.

DSC-MATE-973: (smiling) Well, I'd hate to disappoint, but no, I'm just a regular guy. A regular guy with some killer organizational skills, but that's about it.
