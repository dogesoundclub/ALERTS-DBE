ID # : DSC-MATE-7641
DSC-MATE-7641 is a humanoid entity known as "The Traffic Officer." Her distinctive appearance includes multiple spots on her face and an infectious smile, which can seem almost unsettling when paired with her unusual cybernetic eyes - a pair of bright VR Jade LED lenses.

Despite her mostly human appearance, 7641 is classified as an anomalous entity due to her unique personality traits. Known for her boundless creativity and vivid imagination, The Traffic Officer possesses unusual hobbies and interests that veer towards the surreal. She can often be found writing poetry, designing elaborate cosplay costumes, or collecting peculiar objects that have little to no value to anyone else.

So far, her hobby of collecting objects has yet to pose any containment issues, but her creativity and openness to the unconventional have raised considerable concern among the Foundation's research team. Utmost caution is advised when interacting with DSC-MATE-7641, as her anomalous personality can cause unpredictable behavior and results. As such, containment protocols have been established to ensure the safety of the public and remaining personnel.
