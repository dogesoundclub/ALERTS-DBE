Subject 8267 is a peculiar human known to the banking industry as a diligent banker. However, his appearance belies a strange and unsettling combination of facial features. Their face features spots of varying shapes and sizes, giving them a patchy appearance. What makes it more unnerving is their frightful mouth, as if caught in a never-ending scream. Their blue clown-like eyes catch you off-guard, like a demon's invitation to hell. But their peculiarity doesn't stop at their face, as their head resembles that of a Monk, yet they wear a jade earring in one ear. Adding to the mystery and unease, they wear a medical mask over their lower face, obscuring their expression and voice.

One peculiar addition to their appearance is the silver chain they always wear, the origins of which are unknown to all. The origin of this chain is suspected to carry great significance as it appears to hum with ancient power. It's rumored that it can bring good fortune or great misery to those who cross Subject 8267.

Despite their appearance, Subject 8267 has a great sense of humor that can put people at ease. They can easily make others laugh with silly impersonations or funny stories, which could elevate any mood. Nonetheless, interacting with them always reminds one of the unpredictability of their true nature. Anyone who encounters Subject 8267 should exercise extreme caution as their intentions remain unknown.
