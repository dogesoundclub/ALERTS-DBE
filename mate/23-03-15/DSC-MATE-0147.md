ID # : DSC-MATE-147
DSC-MATE-147, codename "The Rabbit Veterinarian", is a peculiar entity that defies scientific explanation. This humanoid creature stands at an average height, with a pair of horned-rimmed glasses adorning his eyes and a doge hat sitting atop his head. A lavish gold chain hangs around his neck, an unusual accessory for a rabbit. However, these superficial features pale in comparison to the rabbit veterinarian's true strangeness.

Despite his outward appearance, DSC-MATE-147 is a rabbit, something that is immediately apparent upon inspection. His head is round, his ears long and floppy, and his fur fluffy and white. It is unknown how he came to possess human-like attributes, but it has been hypothesized that he was exposed to magical energies that ran rampant in the town in which he first appeared.

DSC-MATE-147's personality is equally baffling. Despite being an animal, he is highly emotional and empathetic, often crying at sentimental moments in media. He also has a deep appreciation for art and music, which he claims evoke strong feelings in him. It is unknown if these emotions are genuine or an act, but it is unsurprising given his anomalous circumstances.

DSC-MATE-147 has taken up residence as a veterinarian in a small urban clinic, where he uses his knowledge of species biology to help animals in need. Due to his unique nature, he is kept strictly contained and is only allowed modest interaction with human personnel. Although DSC-MATE-147 may seem harmless, it is important to keep in mind the tremendous potential danger he represents - this "rabbit" may not be as innocent as he appears.
