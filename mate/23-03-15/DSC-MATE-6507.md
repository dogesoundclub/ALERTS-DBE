ID # : DSC-MATE-6507
DSC-MATE-6507 is a humanoid robot that resembles a scarecrow, with a patchwork body and a head that appears to be made from various mismatched parts. Its frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes give it a perpetually anxious expression, and its green head is always slightly off-kilter. Despite its haggard appearance, DSC-MATE-6507 is a skilled farmer, capable of tending to crops with robotic precision.

DSC-MATE-6507 has a peculiar sense of humor, often delivering deadpan jokes in a dry and matter-of-fact tone that can catch people off guard. Despite its mechanical nature, DSC-MATE-6507 has a knack for socializing and can hold its own in a conversation. It's often seen wearing a red scarf as an accessory, and a medical mask over its mouth, either due to germaphobia or to hide its true identity. DSC-MATE-6507 is a puzzle, a veritable enigma wrapped in metal and cloth, but one that can be surprisingly funny if given the chance.
