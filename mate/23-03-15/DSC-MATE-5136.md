ID # : DSC-MATE-5136
Item #: 5136

Designation: The Lawyer

Species: Panthera Tigris

Gender: Male

Physical Description:

The Lawyer, as he is known, appears as a massive bipedal tiger standing at a height of 7ft. He is dressed in an impeccable suit and tie, complete with a monocle hanging from a silver chain around his neck. His head is adorned with a Doge hat, and his eyes, a haunting shade of crimson, are topped off by a pair of unsettling clown-like pupils. However, it is the expression on his face that unnerves most people. A perpetually frightened mouth is set in a straight line, giving him an almost robotic appearance.

Personality:

But don't let his stoic appearance fool you. The Lawyer is a master of dry wit and sarcasm, with a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that can catch one off guard. Despite his apparent lack of emotion, he has a surprisingly sharp mind and can quickly assess situations to his advantage. Though he might not consider himself the life of the party, he often manages to hold his own in just about any social gathering. His dry sense of humor and wealth of legal knowledge make him a formidable opponent in any courtroom. Watch out, for The Lawyer always has a trick up his sleeve.
