ID # : DSC-MATE-4961
Item #4961 is a real estate agent, but not your run-of-the-mill one. It is a robot with a distinctive green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. Its eyes are ski goggles and its head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap. Additionally, it sports a goggle over its forehead, a red scarf, and a normal gas mask.

Although its appearance may be intimidating, Item #4961 possesses a personality that values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude. However, it also has a playful side, which often leads to humorous situations. It is known to tell jokes and stories passed down through its family or community.

As an DogeSoundClub object, the origins of Item #4961 are currently unknown. Rumors suggest that it was created as a prototype for a home assistant robot but was sold off to a mysterious buyer who reprogrammed it for the real estate industry. Due to its unique features and personality, the Foundation has deemed it worthy of containment and further study.
