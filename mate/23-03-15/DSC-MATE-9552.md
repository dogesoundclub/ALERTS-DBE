ID # : DSC-MATE-9552
DSC-MATE-9552, also known as "The Empath," is a human female in her late twenties. She has distinctive orange stripes on her cheeks and forehead, which are thought to be the result of a rare genetic mutation. Her brown hair is styled in a '90s-era bob, and she often wears a silver chain around her neck.

Despite her role as a villain, DSC-MATE-9552's personality is characterized by a deep empathy and understanding for others. She is easily moved to tears or emotional outbursts when she witnesses someone else's pain or suffering, making her powers a formidable tool in psychological warfare. This empathy also extends to animals and nature, which she sees as integral components of the world around her.

DSC-MATE-9552's ability to emotionally manipulate those around her makes her a dangerous adversary. Agents are advised to approach with caution and to avoid engaging with her on an emotional level. As with all DSC objects, containment is paramount, and any sightings of DSC-MATE-9552 should be reported to Site personnel immediately.
