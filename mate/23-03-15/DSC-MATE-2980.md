DogeSoundClub Containment Report: Subject 2980, codenamed "The Vet"

Identification number 2980 is a male human who works as a veterinarian. Despite his mundane occupation, he exhibits unusual physical features that require containment by the Foundation. He is easily identified by his bright orange stripes that run from his forehead to his chin. Additionally, identification number 2980 wears a purple cap fitted with a headset and accessorizes with a silver chain.

Identification number 2980's most distinctive feature is his nerd glasses, which he uses to make acute observations about his environment. He tends to be logical and analytical, often engaging in debates with others for leisure. However, the debates are not always trivial or unimportant, and they can escalate quickly, causing tension among those involved.

The subject's unique combination of physical and personality traits suggest that identification number 2980 has been exposed to a supernatural event or entity, leading to alterations in his genetic makeup or cognitive structure. As such, he poses a risk to himself and others and must remain isolated in the designated containment area.

Under no circumstances should Foundation staff engage in debates with the subject, as it may lead to a possible containment breach. All interactions with identification number 2980 must be conducted by personnel who possess advanced interpersonal communication and conflict resolution techniques.
