ID # : DSC-MATE-6903
Item #: 6903

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 6903 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to mirrors must be strictly prohibited to prevent unintentional activation of its abilities.

Description:
Subject 6903 is a human male of average height and build. He presents a series of unique and striking features, including a distinct mouth spot on his upper lip, jade LED eyes, green cross earring on his left earlobe, and a medical mask permanently affixed to his face. It also usually wears a gold chain tucked under its Italian-style suit. Subject 6903's appearance is that of a successful fashion designer, which aligns with its profession.

However, those who interact with 6903 also report that it carries itself with an air of traditionality and may be excessively formal or direct in its speech.

Furthermore, DSC-MATE-6903 possesses a subtle memetic effect, which causes people to feel drawn to its presence. It then activates its ability by looking into any mirror inside its containment chamber, allowing it to step outside of the reflective surface, leaving it behind like a door, and transport to another mirror within a distance of up to 20 meters. 

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that 6903 also presents a playful side, often telling jokes, riddles, or stories passed down through his family or community.

Addendum:

After an investigation following DSC-MATE-6903's retrieval, several witnesses confirmed the object's ability to replicate itself indefinitely when observed through mirrors, urging researchers to exercise greater control over the item's containment procedures. Thus, limiting access to mirrors and cameras where Subject 6903 appears on could be used as a preventive measure.
