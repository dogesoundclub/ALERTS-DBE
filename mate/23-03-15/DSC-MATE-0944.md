**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject 944 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber is to be outfitted with various jungle themed stimuli to keep the subject calm and entertained. Subject is to be allowed one hour of recreational time per day in the form of a salon, where they may use their outstanding knowledge of beauty and grooming to provide services to various personnel. Any tools or products used on the subject must meet pre-approved specifications and be inspected for safety prior to use.

**Description:** Subject 944 is a male tiger with an appearance typical of the Bengal subspecies. He stands at approximately 6 feet, 2 inches tall, has piercing green eyes, and is often seen wearing horn-rimmed glasses. The subject's head is adorned with a mane of unruly green hair, and a single jade earring dangles from each ear. A gold chain is draped around the subject's neck, which they claim is their lucky charm. 

Despite the subject's imposing physical presence, they have an outgoing and social personality, and are often described as the life of the party. In addition to their outstanding knowledge of beauty and grooming, the subject also possesses a wicked sense of humor and a talent for telling stories and jokes that can keep an entire room laughing for hours. 

**Addendum:** Subject 944 was originally discovered working as a beautician in a posh salon, where they had garnered a loyal following of clients who regularly praised their skills and charming personality. It wasn't until an incident involving a client's pet parakeet revealed the subject's true nature that the Foundation was able to acquire them. The parakeet in question was scanned during a routine security check and was revealed to have a deep psychic connection to the subject, prompting an investigation that ultimately led to containment. Despite initial resistance, the subject has since adapted well to containment and has become a beloved member of the Foundation community.
