ID # : DSC-MATE-4886
Subject 4886, known as the Traffic Officer, is a human male whose appearance is marked by a peculiar set of features. Spots dot his otherwise unremarkable face while his eyes, enlarged by what appears to be some arcane artifice, are a sickening shade of crimson. He sports a Short Peak Cap atop his head and a Red Victory Band emblazoned on his forehead. 

If one were to observe more closely, they would notice the presence of a Gold Earring, hinting perhaps at a past marred by questionable decisions. 

However, it is not in Subject 4886â€™s appearance that their true peculiarity resides, as it is in their personality that this Traffic Officer defies reason. Introspective to the point of distraction, the subject spends a considerable amount of time lost in thought or immersed in their own daydreams. This tendency is known to have led to comical yet concerning accidents such as collisions with immovable objects or tripping over seemingly innocuous detritus. 

While the presence of this peculiar Traffic Officer may seem innocuous on the surface, one cannot help but wonder if there is more than meets the eye to this curious individual. As always, further observation and analysis will be necessary.
