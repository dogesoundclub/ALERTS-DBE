DogeSoundClub Description:

DSC-MATE-7135, also known as "The Reporter," is a male Bengal tiger with an eccentric fashion sense. He is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck, gold earrings in his ears, and normal prescription glasses on his piercing yellow eyes. A medical mask is worn over his mouth, which is believed to be a precautionary measure for his own safety and the safety of others.

DSC-MATE-7135 works as a journalist for a well-known news publication and has been known to display a certain level of recklessness and impulsiveness in his work. His tendency to act on his emotions rather than on rational thought can sometimes get him into tricky situations, leading him to make spur-of-the-moment decisions that can sometimes be both amusing and surprising to others. 

DSC-MATE-7135 is incredibly talented when it comes to getting a story, but his impulsive actions and dangerous investigations have raised concerns among the Foundation regarding his potential exposure to paranormal entities. It is for this reason that he remains under strict observation and is not allowed to stray too far from his assigned tasks.
