ID # : DSC-MATE-287
REPORT: IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 287

SUBJECT 287, AKA "THE SPOTTY REPORTER," IS A MALE HUMAN KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE APPEARANCE. HE SPORTS SPOTS ACROSS HIS FACE, A DISTINCT TWO-COLOR BAND ON HIS FOREHEAD, AND BLUE CLOWN EYES THAT DRAW IN THE ATTENTION OF ANYONE IN HIS PRESENCE. ADDITIONALLY, HIS EARS FEATURE A GREEN CROSS EARRING, PERHAPS SIGNIFYING HIS AFFILIATION WITH A PARTICULAR CULT OR BELIEF SYSTEM.

287 IS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AS A REPORTER, BUT HIS DUTIES ACTUALLY EXTEND BEYOND THE REALM OF MERE JOURNALISM. WHEN NOT CHASING A STORY, HE ACTIVELY WORKS TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERIES OF THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD. HIS INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN KEY IN HELPING THE FOUNDATION TO TRACK DOWN AND CONTAIN MANY ANOMALOUS ENTITIES.

DESITE HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS WORK, 287 MAKES IT A POINT TO LET LOOSE AND HAVE FUN. HE IS KNOWN TO SHOCK AND DELIGHT HIS FRIENDS WITH HIS SILLY ANTICS AND UNEXPECTED DANCE MOVES, PARTICULARLY AT SOCIAL GATHERINGS OR GALAS. SOME HAVE EVEN SUSPECTED THAT HIS UNIQUE PERSONALITY IS AN EFFECT OF HIS FREQUENT ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ABNORMAL, AND THAT IT HAS MADE HIM MORE...OPEN-MINDED, SHALL WE SAY.

OVERALL, 287 POSSESSES A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY, BUT HE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST. WHETHER REPORTING ON THE LATEST NEWS OR TAKING ON THE UNKNOWN, IT IS CLEAR THAT SUBJECT 287 BROUGHT A UNIQUE SET OF SKILLS TO THE FOUNDATION'S RANKS.
