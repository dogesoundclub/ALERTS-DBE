Item #: 5385

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-5385 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a comfortable living space for a rabbit. The chamber must be equipped with a VR Jade LED screen to simulate an outdoor environment. Standard rabbit food and water must be provided daily.

DSC-MATE-5385 is a prominent reporter in a local news company. All news reports related to DSC-MATE-5385 must be overseen by Foundation personnel to avoid any dissemination of sensitive information.

Description:

DSC-MATE-5385 is a male rabbit with green hair, wears a purple cap with goggles on its forehead, and a red scarf around its neck. It often carries a cigarette in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-5385's VR Jade LED eyes are perpetually fixed to a particular wavelength that coincides with the simulated environment projected on the wall-mounted screen.

DSC-MATE-5385 is not an ordinary rabbit; it exhibits a decidedly human personality with traits of idealism and determination to change the world's situations for the better. DSC-MATE-5385 has a peculiar penchant for protesting, often staging demonstrations or boycotts against entities that go against its ideals.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-5385 was initially found wandering on the streets alone and taken into custody by local wildlife rescue in Essex, England. It began showing signs of aberrant behavior shortly after, exhibiting remarkable intelligence and human-like personality traits.

While it is currently not considered a danger, the Foundation has deemed it essential to keep DSC-MATE-5385 contained as it could attract unwanted attention and become a public spectacle.
