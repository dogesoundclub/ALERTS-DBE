Item #: 6083

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 6083 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Food, water, and other basic necessities should be provided. Contact with outside entities is allowed only with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description:
Subject 6083 is a male monkey, standing roughly 3 feet tall. It has small patches of grey hair on its upper arms, and notably frightened mouth. Its eyes are obscured by a pair of glasses, and it can usually be seen with a headset equipped with small LED lights. Subject 6083 also sports a silver chain and is often seen holding a cigarette.

Subject 6083 has a passion for adventure; it is always looking for new things to try and new risks to take. These traits often lead to humorous situations like surviving a bungee jumping mishap, or getting lost in the wilderness. It is capable of human speech, and often uses this talent to entertain or share its stories.

Special Notes:
Subject 6083 was discovered in the wild, where it had been surviving on its own without any apparent issue. It was initially believed to be a regular primate until its talent for language was discovered. Since its capture, it has been demonstrated a clear preference for working with law, specifically as a lawyer. Its legal knowledge is on par with that of a human lawyer, making it a valuable asset in the criminal justice system.

Addendum:
Subject 6083 has shown no violent tendencies or caused any containment breaches. However, its penchant for taking risks and embarking on dangerous adventures make it a liability to be watched closely. Its well-being must be maintained so it can continue to be an asset in the legal system.
