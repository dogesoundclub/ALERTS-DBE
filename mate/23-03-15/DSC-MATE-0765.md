Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 765, otherwise known as the Politician, is to be constantly monitored at all times. The subject is to be kept under surveillance by a covert team of agents who will ensure that the subject's activities are tracked and recorded.

Any information gathered about the subject is to be immediately reported to Command.

Description:

Subject 765 is a male human specimen exhibiting unusual facial features. The subject has distinctive spots on their face which appear to be a natural genetic mutation. Despite this, the subject has a charming smile that can make anyone feel comfortable in their presence. Subject 765 possesses a classic blonde hairstyle and can often be seen wearing a gold earring attached to their left ear.

The subject regularly wears a medical mask that covers the lower half of their face. The purpose of this is unclear, but it has been suggested that the subject may be trying to conceal dental imperfections or other blemishes.

The subject is often seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory. This chain has yet to be identified as a magical or anomalous object.

Subject 765 is a politician and is known to have a scatterbrained personality. They have been observed to forget important appointments and get sidetracked easily. Although this can lead to humorous situations, it is also an indication of a potential risk for information leaks or security breaches.

Addendum:

The Politician has been involved in several unauthorized activities, including attempts to gain access to DSC facilities and tampering with confidential documents. It is recommended that the subject's access to any DSC-related information or materials be restricted. Extended surveillance and tighter security measures are now in place. Any attempt by the Politician to access DSC-related material must be met with immediate termination of subject privileges.
