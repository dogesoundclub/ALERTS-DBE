ID # : DSC-MATE-2856
DSC-MATE-2856, otherwise known as "The Empath," is a human female who has been noted for her striking red lip and retro cap. Additionally, she is recognized by the goggle that she wears on her forehead, adding to the overall aesthetic of her appearance. She also dons a choker that seems to be a permanent fixture around her neck.

DSC-MATE-2856's empathic abilities are an anomaly worth taking note of. Though she is a villain, she has a deep-rooted empathy for others, making her somewhat unpredictable in her actions. Her compassion has been known to move her to tears, or even to emotional outbursts when she witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. Furthermore, she has a fondness for animals and nature that is both unusual and perplexing.

Though DSC-MATE-2856 is indeed capable of extremely negative behavior, we cannot help but wonder if her powers could be harnessed for good. More research and observations of her behavior will need to be done to make a definitive decision on how to approach this anomaly.
