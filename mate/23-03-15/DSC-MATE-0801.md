DogeSoundClub Profile: Subject 801, Codename "Jester"

Subject 801 is a Traffic Officer working in a nearby city. Though he appears to be an average human male, his striking appearance proves otherwise. His face is dotted with spots, which under most circumstances would be a cause for concern, but with Subject 801 it only adds to the carefree nature of his persona. He is often seen sporting a wide smile, which can be disarming to some but unsettling to others. His bright red clown eyes may garner him some strange looks but these are often overshadowed by his affable nature.

Subject 801 completes his look with his Police cap, adorned with the department's emblem, and a green cross earring, which may hold some personal significance to the subject. He is rarely seen without a bright red scarf, which hangs loosely around his neck, and a cigarette clamped between his lips. 

As for his personality, Subject 801 is an enigma. He tends to be very analytical and logical, preferring to weigh out all options before making a decision. He enjoys getting into heated debates with others, even about trivial and unimportant topics. This trait may cause concern to some, but it only adds to his charming nature. He is a jester, pulling the strings of his conversations to create a show for his own amusement. 

The Foundation has deemed it necessary to monitor Subject 801, due to his unique appearance and sometimes eccentric behavior. However, he is currently not a threat to the general populace and is deemed to be allowed to continue living his life as he sees fit. Future monitoring will be done to ensure that he remains harmless.
