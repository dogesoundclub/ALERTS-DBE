ID # : DSC-MATE-4577
DSC-MATE-4577, also known as "The Joker", is a humanoid security guard, assigned to protect and secure this facility. Despite being a human, this individual's appearance is far from ordinary. He has red clown eyes that seem to hypnotize his victims and a jade earring that emits a strange energy. The most prominent facial feature is his unsettling, ever-present smile, which he seems to wear effortlessly.

The Joker has been observed wearing a gold chain around his neck, perhaps as a symbol of his wealth or a reminder of his past. He also carries a candy stick, which he appears to use as a stress-relieving tool.

Despite his abnormality, The Joker is a reliable and effective security guard. He is known for his ambitious and goal-oriented nature, which often leads him to take on more than he can handle. However, his exceptional strategic thinking and organizational skills help him manage his workload.

Extreme caution is advised when interacting with DSC-MATE-4577. While he appears friendly and accommodating, his unpredictable and dangerous behavior could result in potential harm to personnel.
