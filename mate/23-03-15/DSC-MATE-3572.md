Item #3572, also known as the Doctor, is a female human with distinct orange stripes on her face, accompanied by a striking red lip. Her eyes are concealed behind a pair of standard glasses, and she dons a bucket hat on top of a medical mask covering her mouth. The Doctor accessorizes with a stylish gold chain, a hint to her individuality outside of her profession. 

Despite her occupation as a medical professional, the Doctor's personality truly shines through her nurturing and compassionate nature. This trait goes beyond the care she provides to her patients, as she extends her affection towards inanimate objects, giving them names and even personalities. Her fondness for her belongings may seem peculiar to some, but it is a trait that sets her apart from her peers. 

Be aware that the Doctor may not interact with the world in the most traditional manner. Be cautious not to interfere with her affections for her cherished possessions, as the consequences could be uncertain. Stay alert and take every precaution if you encounter the Doctor, as her emotional attachment to objects may lead to unpredictable reactions.
