ID # : DSC-MATE-3452
DSC-MATE-3452, also known as "The Primate Beautician," is a male monkey of an unknown species. This anomalous creature is distinguishable by their unmistakable nerd glasses, which sit atop their head, accompanied by a retro cap. Adorning one of their ears is a glimmering gold earring, while they're often seen wearing a bright red scarf around their neck. 

DSC-MATE-3452 works as a beautician, offering grooming and styling services to both humans and animals alike. They have a particular talent for transforming their clients' appearances, often leaving them feeling more confident and content with their appearance. 

Despite their profession, DSC-MATE-3452 is an incredibly empathetic and compassionate creature. They often find themselves taking on the problems of those around them, feeling a sense of responsibility to help them find solutions. While this may seem admirable, it can often lead to the monkey feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, taking on more burdens than they can handle. 

As an DSC, DSC-MATE-3452's abilities extend beyond their physical appearance and their impressive social skills. They have been known to produce a variety of cosmetic products with incredible, borderline magical, properties. Any of these products coming into contact with human or animal skin can result in dramatic transformations, ranging from enhanced physical appearance to outright shapeshifting. As a result, it is recommended that any interactions with DSC-MATE-3452 should be approached with caution, and with proper containment measures in place.
