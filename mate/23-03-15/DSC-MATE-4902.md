Description:
Subject 4902 is a male human in his mid-30s, standing at 5'10" with a lanky build. His prominent feature is the nerd glasses that hide his eyes, which appear to be a deep brown hue. He is often seen wearing a hoodie, with a red scarf wrapped around his neck, and an LED gas mask that covers his lower face. Subject 4902 is a licensed veterinarian, and he shows expertise in handling both mundane and anomalous animals.

Personality:
Subject 4902 is known for his impulsivity and lack of forethought. Despite his intelligence and education, he displays a disregard for standard protocols and boundaries necessary for his job, which leads to precarious situations. Subject 4902 is prone to acting first and following the rules later, which has put others in danger. However, his friendly and approachable way of communicating somewhat makes up for his rash behavior.

Containment Procedure:
Subject 4902 is to remain under constant supervision. All his equipment is to be checked, and any unauthorized gadget or tool is to be confiscated. He is to be accompanied by a security detail when working on anomalous creatures. Subject 4902 is only to access areas designated for his duties, with any other unauthorized access considered a breach in protocol.

Interview Log:
Dr. ███████: Greetings, Subject 4902. How can you explain your impulsive nature to us?

Subject 4902: *chuckles* Oh, come on, doc. You guys make it all sound so complicated. I see a sick animal, or a creature in need of care, and my instincts kick in. Simple as that. 

Dr. ███████: But you are aware of the dangers that some of these animals exhibit, yes?

Subject 4902: Of course, but that's why you guys hired me, isn't it? To take care of them. *pauses* Listen, doc, sometimes we need to throw the rulebook out the window and handle things on the fly. It's what separates the good from the great.

Dr. ███████: I see. Do you think you can work without imposing undue risks to yourself or others?

Subject 4902: *sighs* Listen, doc, I'm not a liability. I know what I'm doing. The animals trust me, and I trust them. It's all about balance. 

Closing Statement:
Subject 4902 displays a disregard for standard protocols, but his skills and expertise make him an asset to the foundation. Careful monitoring of his actions is necessary to prevent any unnecessary risks to himself or other personnel.
