ID # : DSC-MATE-3641
Subject 3641 is a peculiar specimen. A creature resembling a rabbit but with a sense of style and personality unlike any other of its kin. Identified as a delivery driver, 3641 is often seen sporting a bucket hat atop its head, accompanied by a gold earring dangling from its left ear. Its eyes, although unconfirmed, have been rumored to be as bright and piercing as the sun itself.

Accessorized with a red scarf and a cigarette almost always dangling from its lips, 3641 commands a presence akin to that of a master gift-giver. Masterful in its attention to detail, itâ€™s capable of discerning the perfect gift for anyone it comes across with ease. However, this gift-giving obsession drives 3641 to agonize over selections, viewed almost like an obsession.

We suggest that any interaction with 3641 should be kept brief, as indulging in a conversation may be viewed as a request or obligation for gift-giving, leading to uncontrolled or unnecessary implications. In summary, do not look a gift rabbit in the mouth.
