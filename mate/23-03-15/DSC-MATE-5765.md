As a security guard, she is excellent at her job, ensuring that all the secret, supernatural artifacts of the world remain safe from those who would use them for their own nefarious purposes.

Despite this, The Striped Guard is known for her kind heart and her willingness to help those in need. She is a force to be reckoned with, but also a valuable ally in the murky world of urban fantasy, as she is always willing to lend a hand to protect those who need it most.

So, if you hear rumors of a mysterious security guard who patrols the city streets, donning a hoodie and a mask, remember that it could only be DogeSoundClub Identification Number 5765, The Striped Guard.
