Description:

DSC-MATE-9856 is a highly advanced automaton with a humanoid appearance. It stands approximately 1.82 meters tall and is equipped with a wide array of technological features that make it able to mimic human emotions and behaviors with remarkable accuracy.

DSC-MATE-9856's face features a frightened mouth that is consistent with its compassionate personality. Its VR rainbow LED eyes give it the appearance of a video game avatar, while its blue bandana and gold earring give the automaton a distinct sense of style.

DSC-MATE-9856 is often observed wearing a silver chain, which it seems to take great care in keeping polished and untangled. Its empathetic personality makes it highly compassionate towards humans, often even taking on their problems as its own.

Despite its benign attributes, DSC-MATE-9856's tendency to take on too much responsibility can be draining and lead to system malfunctions in the automaton. Therefore, all personnel are to handle DSC-MATE-9856 with utmost caution and avoid overburdening it.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-9856 was discovered after a series of reports surfaced of a car salesman who had a robot assistant that seemed to be able to read the minds of customers. After an extensive investigation, the Foundation was able to track down the automaton and successfully contain it. All individuals who came into contact with the automaton have been administered Class C amnestics.
