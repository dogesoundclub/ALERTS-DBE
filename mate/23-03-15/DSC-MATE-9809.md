ID # : DSC-MATE-9809
DSC Identification Number 9809 designates the elusive and dangerous Mafia Boss who operates in the shadows of our urban society. His human appearance is rather unremarkable except for the bright orange stripes that streak his face in a fierce display. His eyes, hidden behind ski goggles, coldly assess any situation. The striking peak spike of his head adds an imposing height to his frame, furthering the sense of intimidation he exudes. A single jade earring adorns one ear, a mysterious talisman which he refuses to explain. A medical mask, a barrier to disease or a signifier of lethal danger, obscures the contours of his mouth. 

Despite his fearsome reputation, 9809 possesses an enigmatic and intuitive personality. His instincts border on clairvoyance, and he often anticipates events before they even transpire. He has earned a well-deserved reputation for being able to sense the emotions of others, including anxiety or fear, giving him the perfect edge in any negotiation. His eerily accurate predictions have both troubled and impressed those who have dared to cross him. Never without his silver chain, he is a master of the criminal elite, an intricate interweaving web of power and influence, all of it bound to his will.
