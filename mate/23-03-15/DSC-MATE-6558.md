ID # : DSC-MATE-6558
DSC-MATE-6558, codenamed "The Monkey Brainstormer", is a male primate assigned to work as a security guard in our facility. Its species appears to be some sort of monkey, presumably descended from a baboon, although further research is needed to confirm this.

DSC-MATE-6558's most notable physical features are its horned rim glasses and Doge hat, which it seems to be quite attached to. Additionally, it sports a two-color band on its forehead, and is often seen wearing a red scarf and a normal gas mask.

More important than its appearance, however, is DSC-MATE-6558's unique personality. This primate has proven itself to be a natural brainstormer, always coming up with new and creative ideas. This often leads to humorous situations, with DSC-MATE-6558 suggesting outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react.

Despite its playful nature, however, DSC-MATE-6558 is a reliable security guard and takes its job seriously. In the event of an emergency, we trust that this primate will utilize its creativity to help protect our facility and its inhabitants.
