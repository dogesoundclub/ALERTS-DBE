ID # : DSC-MATE-8386
Subject 8386, codenamed "Hopper," is a brave member of the local firefighting team, despite his small stature and timid demeanor. He is easily recognizable by his frightened mouth, which seems to be in a perpetual state of shock. His horned rim glasses are practically glued to his face, and his forehead boasts a red victory band that glimmers in the light.

One of Hopper's most impressive features is his trusty red scarf, which he wears at all times. Despite its practical use in keeping him warm, the scarf is a symbol of the fire that rages deep within his soul. This fire drives him to protect and defend those in need, even when the danger is great.

To aid him in his heroic task, Hopper is never without his normal gas mask. This piece of equipment allows him to bravely charge into burning buildings and emerge unscathed, ready to take on another challenge.

Despite his physically imposing appearance, Hopper is a gentle soul who has a deep empathy and understanding for others. He is moved to tears or emotional outbursts when he witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. This trait is likely a byproduct of his fondness for animals and nature, which he develops through his work with the local fire department.

Overall, Subject 8386 is a valuable member of the team, and he is sure to make a lasting impression on anyone he encounters.
