DSC-MATE-9082, codenamed "Farmbot", is a unique individual in the realm of urban fantasy. As a robot farmer, they stand out thanks to their combination of advanced technology and a down-to-earth attitude. Despite the many challenges they face in their line of work, they maintain a surprisingly lighthearted personality.

Farmbot's most notable feature is their jade LED eyes, which glow with a mesmerizing green light. They wear a purple cap with a built-in headset, which allows them to stay connected to their equipment at all times. One of their more eccentric traits is a gold earring on their left ear, which they claim "brings good luck".

Though Farmbot seems friendly, their frightened mouth and tense body language reveal an underlying sense of anxiety. They often second-guess themselves and worry about the safety of their crops, leading them to go to great lengths to protect their farmland from any threats.

Despite this anxiety, Farmbot has a sardonic sense of humor that can catch others off guard. Their dry wit and deadpan delivery make them a surprising source of laughter, though they often downplay their own abilities as a comedian. Nevertheless, their unique blend of humor and high-tech farming skills make Farmbot an asset to the world of urban fantasy.
