ID # : DSC-MATE-6524
DSC-MATE-6524 is a human male veterinarian with distinctive orange stripes, set against a dark background. Eyes are concealed by normal glasses, while his ears are adorned with a gold earring. A medical mask covers his mouth, making him stand out in a hospital environment.

A gold chain adds a touch of luxury to his simple and comfortable clothes, accenting his clean and orderly appearance.

However, personnel are warned that DSC-MATE-6524's obsessive-compulsive tendencies are not limited to aesthetic matters. He is fixated on details and meticulous in his work, but this can lead to delayed decision-making and excessive caution.

Recently, some staff members have reported that DSC-MATE-6524's compulsions have taken an unusual turn, leading him to alphabetize animal specimens and color-code medicine vials.

As such, researchers are advised to monitor DSC-MATE-6524's behavior and report any unusual activity to higher-ups for further investigation.
