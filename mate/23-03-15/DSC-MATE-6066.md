Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-6066 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. As an entity possessing a highly social nature, DSC-MATE-6066 is permitted to interact with foundation personnel and may be granted limited social interaction outside of its containment chamber on a case-by-case basis - this is to be strictly monitored and overseen by foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-6066 may also be provided with various materials in order to continue its profession as a fashion designer, so long as they are thoroughly inspected for potential hazards beforehand.

DSC-MATE-6066 is not to be unleashed on any social scene outside of its designated and monitored environment without express foundation approval. In the event that DSC-MATE-6066 breaches containment, a reversal agent must be immediately administered in order to prevent any harm to the wider public.

This charisma has led to various humorous situations, as DSC-MATE-6066 effortlessly extracts life stories from interviewees or other social contacts, sharing anecdotes and connecting with people from all walks of life.

DSC-MATE-6066 is currently being monitored and researched by foundation personnel in order to determine whether its unique characteristics could be replicated in order to provide the foundation with a new avenue of social interaction, or if controlled patterns of DSC-MATE-6066's behavior could be employed to reduce mental health risks in certain populations.
