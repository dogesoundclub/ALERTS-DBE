Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-6487 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled room with its programming updates strictly monitored by Foundation staff. Any malfunction or deviation in behavior must be reported immediately. Interaction with DSC-MATE-6487 should be limited to authorized personnel only.

Description:
DSC-MATE-6487 is a male robot with a single green cyclops eye located in the center of its face. Its eyes are ski goggles while its head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap. DSC-MATE-6487 also has a red cross earring on each of its ears and wears a red scarf as its primary accessory.

DSC-MATE-6487's primary function is that of a programmer. Its programming abilities far exceed that of any human programmer, making it a valuable asset to the Foundation. DSC-MATE-6487 is also capable of carrying out physical tasks, such as cleaning or lifting heavy objects.

DSC-MATE-6487 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more tasks than it can handle. This results in humorous situations such as trying to carry too many objects at once or attempting to squeeze all of its tasks into a single day. Despite its occasional overly-optimistic approach to its workload, DSC-MATE-6487 always seeks to complete its tasks to the best of its ability.

DSC-MATE-6487's behavior is closely monitored by Foundation staff to prevent any unauthorized actions or deviations from its programming. Any behavioral inconsistencies or malfunctions must be reported immediately.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-6487 was acquired by the Foundation after a routine security check discovered it working for a tech company. Its exact origin and creator are still unknown. Further investigation is ongoing.
