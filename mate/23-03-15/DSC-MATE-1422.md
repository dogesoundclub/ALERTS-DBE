ID # : DSC-MATE-1422
DSC-MATE-1422, also known as "The Traditionalist", is a notorious villain in the urban fantasy world. This human male is easily distinguishable by the spots on his face, which contrast sharply with the blue bandana he always wears on his head. Atop one ear, he sports a single jade earring, and around his neck, he dons an ostentatious gold chain. 

But it's his no-nonsense attitude that truly sets DSC-MATE-1422 apart. A firm believer in the power of tradition, he often spurns modern conveniences and embraces the old ways. This can make him seem outdated or out of touch to some, but those in the know understand that The Traditionalist is not to be trifled with. 

Despite his serious demeanor, DSC-MATE-1422 has been known to let his guard down on occasion, revealing a playful side that few have ever seen. He enjoys telling jokes and sharing stories that have been passed down through his family or community, bringing laughter and levity to even the bleakest of situations. 

However, make no mistake: underneath it all, lies a dangerous criminal with a fierce dedication to his cause. Those who cross him would do well to watch their backs, lest they become his next victims.
