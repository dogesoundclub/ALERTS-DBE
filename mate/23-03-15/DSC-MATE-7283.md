ID # : DSC-MATE-7283
DSC-MATE-7283, also known as "The Legal Counsel", is a humanoid robot designed to assist clients in legal matters. Its most prominent feature is a single green cyclops eye that glows dimly in low light conditions. The mouth is often seen in a frightened expression, which reflects the robot's nervous disposition.

The eyes are covered with thick, black nerd glasses, giving it an intellectual appearance. Its head is fashioned in a not-arranged green, signifying its advanced robotic technology, while gold earrings adorn its pointed ears. The mouth is often concealed by a medical mask, likely a precaution against spreading or catching illness through human interaction.

The robotic lawyer is typically found donning a silver chain, symbolizing its position of authority amongst clients. However, despite its professional demeanor, DSC-MATE-7283's introspective nature can lead to humorous incidents, such as tripping over objects while lost in thought.

DSC-MATE-7283's analytical programming makes it adept at identifying legal discrepancies and loopholes, allowing it to provide decisive and impartial legal advice. However, given its nervous disposition, employees are advised to avoid sudden movements and loud noises in its presence.
