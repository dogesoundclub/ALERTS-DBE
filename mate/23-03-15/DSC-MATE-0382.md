ID # : DSC-MATE-382
Subject 382 is a peculiar human creature. Not much is known about their background, except that they have taken up the profession of a car salesman. They can be identified by their clown mouth, which perpetually curves up into a grin that is at once friendly and disarming. Their blue clown eyes seem to twinkle with an inner mischief, as if they are always on the verge of playing a prank on someone.

Subject 382 has an air of old-world charm about them, perhaps due to their gold earring that glints in the sunlight. They are often seen donning a red scarf that has a certain air of magic about it, though no one knows where it comes from. Most remarkable, though, is their normal gas mask, which they wear at all times, as if they are preparing for the apocalypse.

The most striking feature of Subject 382 is their personality, which is a curious blend of tradition and playfulness. They take pride in their heritage and often tell stories or jokes that have been passed down through generations. However, they also have a no-nonsense attitude and are not afraid to speak their mind. This often leads to humorous situations, as they are not afraid to poke fun at themselves or others.

It is unknown what kind of world Subject 382 comes from, but their presence in our realm is both intriguing and puzzling. One thing is for sure - they are a force to be reckoned with, and their presence is sure to shake things up in unexpected ways.
