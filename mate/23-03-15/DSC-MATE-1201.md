Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 1201, codenamed "Rabbit," is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to her profession as a fashion designer, Rabbit is allowed access to materials and tools for creative expression, but these items must be thoroughly inspected before being granted to her. Any requests for specialized materials or equipment must go through the proper channels for approval before being provided. Rabbit's obsessive tendencies are to be monitored for signs of any unusual behaviors, and any irregularities should be reported to the containment team immediately.

Description:
Subject 1201, known as Rabbit, is a humanoid female of the Homo Sapiens species. She stands at 5'7" and weighs approximately 126lbs. Her most notable facial features are her bright orange stripes across her cheeks and her vibrant red lips. Her eyes are replaced with virtual reality jade LED lenses. Her head is that of a pink rabbit, with large floppy ears and a small button nose. She frequently wears a medical mask over her mouth, further enhancing her strange appearance. She is often seen accessorized with a silver chain around her neck.

Rabbit's personality is one of extreme attention to detail, sometimes to the point of obsession. Her focus on organization and order can be seen in her alphabetized spice rack and her color-coded closet. This trait also influences her fashion designs, as she is known for her intricate and impeccably crafted pieces. However, her obsessive nature can sometimes lead her down unexpected paths, prompting her to fixate on tasks that seem trivial to others.

Overall, Rabbit is considered a low-risk subject with no known anomalous abilities or tendencies. However, her unique appearance and personality make her an interesting addition to the Foundation's collection of unusual entities.
