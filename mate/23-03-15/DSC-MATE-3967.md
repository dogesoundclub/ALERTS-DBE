Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 3967 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to the chamber is granted only with Level 4 clearance and may only occur after obtaining verbal agreement from Subject 3967. All interactions with Subject 3967 must be monitored and recorded for research purposes. Any breach of containment must be immediately reported to Site Security.

Description:

Subject 3967, commonly referred to as "The Farmer," is a human female of average height and weight. Her most noticeable features are her purple lips and red clown eyes which are believed to result from an as-yet-undefined anomaly. Her head is adorned with brown hair styled in the fashion of the 1990s, and she wears a green cross earring.

Subject 3967 seems to have a natural inclination towards analytical and logical thinking, often arguing with others for the sake of the debate alone. This predisposition to argumentation has occasionally led to humorous situations where she becomes emotionally invested in trivial and unimportant matters. Despite her confrontational personality, she's reportedly cooperative with Site personnel.

Addendum 1:

Subject 3967 came to the Foundation's attention after reports of her unusual appearance in conjunction with her argumentative behavior began making rounds in the nearby community. Further investigation revealed that her anomalous attributes hadn't manifested until a year prior. After detailed study, it was discovered that her condition stems from an unknown genetic mutation still under examination.

Addendum 2:

Experiments conducted on Subject 3967 have thus far yielded limited results. Despite her unusual abilities, she has shown no capacity for other-affecting abilities such as telekinesis or telepathy. The continued study of Subject 3967 is necessary to gauge any potential containment or possible utilization.
