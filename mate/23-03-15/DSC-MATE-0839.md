ID # : DSC-MATE-839
Subject 839, codenamed "Tiger Farmer," is a prime specimen of the feline species, displaying characteristic behaviors such as hunting, grooming, and territorial marking. Despite their impressive physical prowess, this individual is often seen with a look of deep distress on their face, with their mouth twisted into a frightened expression as if constantly on edge. 

The eyes of Tiger Farmer are a luminous red color reminiscent of the painted visage of a sinister clown, prompting suspicions of possible anomalous effects. The head of the subject is adorned with a blue bandana, possibly serving as a symbol of authority or territorial ownership. Adding to their eccentric appearance, Tiger Farmer also sports a single red cross earring on one of their perked ears, a testament to their individuality and possibly their religious beliefs. 

But it is the two accessories Tiger Farmer keeps on their person at all times that truly sets them apart. A glimmering gold chain, whose significance is unknown, dangles from their neck, and a shrill whistle hangs from their waist, suggesting a need for quick communication or a warning signal. 

Despite their outward appearance of fear and uncertainty, Tiger Farmer possesses a creative mind and an imagination that often takes on unusual hobbies and interests. They have been known to write poetry, engage in complex cosplay costumes, and collect eclectic and bizarre items. Further observation is recommended to determine the purpose behind these activities and their possible correlation to anomalous effects.
