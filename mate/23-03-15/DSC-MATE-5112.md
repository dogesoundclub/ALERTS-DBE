ID # : DSC-MATE-5112
DSC-MATE-5112, codenamed "The Tiger Vet," is a male tiger who works as a veterinarian in the urban area. DSC-MATE-5112 stands out from other tigers with his distinct face feature, a frightened mouth that gives off an almost helpless look. To mask his anxiety, DSC-MATE-5112 wears a medical mask, and he wears normal glasses to see. On the top of his green hair, he wears a purple cap that displays a symbol, which is believed to be the logo of his veterinary clinic.

DSC-MATE-5112's most striking feature is his two-color band on his forehead, which indicates his high rank in the local tiger's council. DSC-MATE-5112 is ambitious and goal-oriented, and as a result, he often takes on more tasks than he can realistically manage. However, his strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills enable him to pull off challenging assignments like a pro.

DogeSoundClub researchers have noted that DSC-MATE-5112's natural instincts sometimes confuse him, leading him to respond aggressively before turning docile at the most unexpected moments. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-5112 remains a valuable asset, both for the Foundation and the local tiger population.
