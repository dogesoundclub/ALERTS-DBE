ID # : DSC-MATE-4750
Identification number 4750 is a curious specimen, known as an electrician among the mundane world. However, there is more to this human than meets the eye. The first notable feature is his bright orange stripes decorating his face with pride, as if daring anyone to challenge his uniqueness. Paired with a friendly smile that stretches ear to ear, it's easy to overlook the second feature- a pair of nerd glasses that only add to his charm.

But it's the forehead that holds a clue to his strange nature - two color bands adorned on his skin. A silver chain hangs around his neck, possibly a protection charm or an identifier in his circle. What makes this human truly fascinating is his personality. Possessing an infectious sense of humor, he uses it as a tool to smooth over rough moments or just to brighten someone's day. He may regale amusing stories or do silly impersonations, bringing much-needed levity to whatever situation he's in.

As an electrician, he has access to a different type of current that runs through humanity, one that powers the thin veil of reality that separates them from the unknown. With his unique features and jolly personality, there is no doubt that identification number 4750 is something out of the ordinary, perhaps an anomaly that deserves further study... or protection.
