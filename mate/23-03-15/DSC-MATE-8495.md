ID # : DSC-MATE-8495
DSC-MATE-8495 is a humanoid entity designated as a Class X Anomaly. This subject is a farmer of human descent with distinct physical anomalies that set him apart from other humans. DSC-MATE-8495's most notable features include a wide, toothy smile and bright blue clown eyes that appear to change color depending on his emotional state.

The subject's head is covered in a thick layer of green foliage, which researchers believe to be a form of plant life that has somehow integrated with DSC-MATE-8495's body. This plant layer appears to coexist with DSC-MATE-8495's biology and provides him with an additional layer of protection and camouflage.

DSC-MATE-8495 is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette. The scarf seems to possess no anomalous properties, but the cigarette is theorized to contain a powerful hallucinogenic that alters DSC-MATE-8495's cognitive perception of reality.

DSC-MATE-8495's personality is fairly unpredictable, with a tendency to value social connections and strive towards harmony. However, the subject is also known to have a goofy side, often telling jokes and engaging in playful banter with others. This behavior has led to several humorous situations but has also raised concerns about DSC-MATE-8495's ability to behave appropriately in certain social situations.

Researchers are continuing to study DSC-MATE-8495's physical and psychological makeup to better understand the nature of this anomaly and its potential risks to society.
