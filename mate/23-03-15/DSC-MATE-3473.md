ID # : DSC-MATE-3473
DSC-MATE-3473 is a highly unusual specimen of the tiger species, with several distinct physical features that set them apart from mundane individuals of their kind. Identified by their unique accessoires, namely a purple cap and a red cross earring, it is truly DSC-MATE-3473's LED gas mask that is the most peculiar aspect of their appearance. Wholly impractical for their line of work as a fast food worker, this mask has evoked suspicion among Foundation personnel as a potential tool for anomalous activity.

DSC-MATE-3473's personality is characterized by a tendency for distraction and forgetfulness, making them a less than ideal candidate for clandestine operations. Their scattered nature can lead to humorous situations, although their potential for compromised operational security cannot be understated. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-3473's unique physical characteristics and history of anomalous potential make them a valuable specimen for further study by the Foundation.
