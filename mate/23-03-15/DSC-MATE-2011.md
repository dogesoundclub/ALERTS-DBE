Subject 2011 is a robotic entity that has taken on the appearance of a human male. Despite this, it is evident from their Horned Rim Glasses that they are not simply a flesh and blood creature. Their head stays covered with a classic Bucket Hat, and a jade earring hangs boldly from one ear, indicative of a distinct sense of style.

Subject 2011's daily task includes the valiant duty of a firefighter, in which they are uniquely equipped to handle. They work tirelessly to put out fires and save those in grave danger.

Their empathy towards human emotional states is particularly noteworthy, with an uncanny ability to read the emotional state of others. This enables Subject 2011 to gain an advantage in a variety of situations, particularly when someone is in distress.

While their Gold Chain hinting at their affluence may indicate the contrary, however, their focus remains on the well-being of those they are surrounded by. Their stoic facade can be shaken by a humorous situation, as there is a lighthearted side hidden beneath the surface.

Given their unique abilities and personality traits, it is vital to observe Subject 2011 further and determine how to utilize them suitably for the good of the Foundation.
