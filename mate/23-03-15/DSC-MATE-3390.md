DogeSoundClub Description:

Subject 3390, also known as "The Stripe", is a human male Security Guard with unique facial features. He has orange stripes on his face, which are constantly visible through his green layers of skin. Despite his unusual appearance, The Stripe presents himself as unassuming with his normal glasses. Additionally, he wears a red scarf and often carries a cigarette, which he habitually smokes.

The Stripe's personality can be described as dry and sarcastic. Though he's not the most outgoing person, he has a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that leave people laughing, even if it takes them a few moments to catch on. On the surface, he is a stoic and focused individual, quick to survey his surroundings and always aware of his surroundings. However, upon further interaction, his jovial side may emerge, much to the surprise of his acquaintances.

Subject 3390's security expertise and humor make him a valuable asset to the Foundation, and his unique appearance makes him easily recognizable to anyone who encounters him within the Foundation's walls. As of now, his condition and the cause of his unique appearance remain a mystery to the scientific team assigned to him.
