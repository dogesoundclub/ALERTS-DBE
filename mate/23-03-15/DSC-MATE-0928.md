ID # : DSC-MATE-928
Item #: 928

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Politician

Notes: This humanoid creature identifies as a male tiger that appears to be capable of complex communication in various languages. He is often seen covering his face with a medical mask and donning a bucket hat. His glasses and gold earring are the only unique features visible on his physical body.

Behavioral Analysis: Despite being a politician, his personality portrays him as a highly intuitive being that seems to possess psychic powers. He exhibits an uncanny ability to predict events before they occur, and his capacity to sense emotions and feelings is intense and can be unsettling for those in his vicinity. It appears that his intuition allows him to gain a deeper understanding of people and their thoughts, which he exploits to his advantage.

Containment Procedure: Due to the unpredictability of his abilities and the potential threat it poses to the general public, it is mandated that this creature be held within a sealed container at all times. The containment chamber should be equipped with a ventilation system that filters out any pathogens or germs that may spread under normal conditions. Access to the containment chamber should be limited to personnel equipped with proper facial protective gear to minimize any potential psychological or physical harm.

Please note that this creature's ability to perceive thoughts and emotions makes it challenging to manipulate or deceive, making contact with him must be handled with caution, and all communication must be thoroughly monitored.

Interview Logs:

The following is a fragment of an interview conducted with creature 928 during the containment process:

Interviewer: How did you develop your abilities?

928: Abilities? What abilities are you referring to?

Interviewer: The power of intuition, sensing people's thoughts and emotions before they happen or feeling people's hidden sentiments.

928: (laughs) That's just part of what I am. I've always had this gift, and as I grew older, it only became more apparent. It's like an extension of myself.

Interviewer: So, you're saying that it is a natural ability?

928: Its part of who I am. Why is this such an important subject for you?"

Interviewer: We're here to learn about your capabilities and ensure that they do not cause harm to humanity.

928: (smiling) Ah, I see. Placing me in a container is not going to solve anything, you know? My abilities are out of my control, and they react to whatever they sense. It's just like how you humans tend to react to unexpected events. Nothing to be worried about, in my opinion.
