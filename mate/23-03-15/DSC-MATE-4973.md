ID # : DSC-MATE-4973
Identification number 4973 is a highly unusual human being. Her face is marked with striking orange stripes that make her stand out in any crowd, and her lips are a vibrant red that draws the eye. However, it is her eyes that are truly unsettling - they are red clown eyes that seem to penetrate straight through a person's soul.

Her head is crowned with striking green hair that is always topped off by a purple cap. Her ears are adorned with a pair of jade earrings that glint in the light, and her mouth is always covered by a medical mask. To complete her look, she wears a choker around her neck that looks like it could double as a weapon.

Despite her eccentric appearance, identification number 4973 is highly skilled as a programmer. Her work is impeccable and efficient, and her code is some of the best in the business. However, she has a strong sense of independence and often disregards authority or rules that she sees as unnecessary. This can lead to rebellious behavior such as sneaking out of the office early, taking a day off without permission, or even hacking into the company's system when she feels like it.

Some say that identification number 4973 has a touch of madness about her, but nobody can deny her expertise in her field. She may be unconventional and unpredictable, but she is an asset to any team lucky enough to have her on board.
