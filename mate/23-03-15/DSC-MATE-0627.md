DogeSoundClub Description:

Subject 627, also known as "The Fixer," is a human male with a unique set of physical features. His most prominent trait is his unnerving red clown eyes that seem to pierce through anyone who meets his gaze. Subject 627 dons a Doge hat over his messy, blonde hair, and a rare Jade earring that hangs off his left ear. He is often seen wearing a standard gas mask, though it is unclear whether the mask has a practical use or serves to intimidate those around him.

Subject 627's career as a police officer is not uncommon for individuals with his skillset. However, his approach to law enforcement is anything but typical. The Fixer often utilizes off-the-wall methods to solve crime, and he always completes his tasks by any means necessary. He has a practical and hands-on approach to solving problems, often fixing things in unconventional ways. Witnesses have reported him using duct tape to repair a broken object, rigging up makeshift solutions, and even tampering with evidence that he believes will prove useful.

Although mysterious and unnerving to many, the Fixer's only intent is to serve and protect the community he holds a deep sense of duty for. His unique features and odd behavior have made him an effective officer, and one that should not be dismissed as anything but competent. The DogeSoundClub deems Subject 627 and his abilities valuable to their database and will continue to study him in containment.
