Item #: 5494

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5494, referred to as "The Farmer," is to be kept in a standard containment chamber isolated from other organisms. It is to be provided with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables for consumption. Experimentation with 5494 is to be supervised by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description:

5494 appears to be an ordinary capuchin monkey, standing at approximately 30cm tall and weighing around 3kg. It possesses a retro cap on its head, with an appearance of a typical farmer. Its face features a frightened mouth with blue clown eyes that can change colors depending on its mood. Additionally, 5494 has a gold earring on its left ear and dons a gold chain around its neck.

However, what sets 5494 apart is its uncanny ability to read emotions exceptionally well. Its strong sense of intuition allows it to predict events before they occur. The subject can sense when someone is dealing with anxiety or agitation, which can leave those around feeling slightly unnerving.

The Farmer has been observed exhibiting behaviors that appear to be beyond the capacity of its species. It is suspected that 5494's unique abilities may stem from exposure to mystical energies that have activated latent psychic abilities.

The subject has demonstrated no overtly aggressive behavior towards any personnel. However, staff should remain vigilant around the subject, as it has displayed signs of extreme distress during interactions with new subjects.

Despite its anomalous abilities, 5494 appears to be a calm and easy going subject, content with a simple life of farming and generally non-violent activities.

It should be noted that the containment of 5494 is of utmost importance to prevent it from becoming a breeding source for a new species of psychic monkeys.
