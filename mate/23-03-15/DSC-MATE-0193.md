ID # : DSC-MATE-193
DSC-MATE-193 is a peculiar specimen of the human species, distinguishable by their unique facial features. Consisting of orange stripes that adorn their face atop a head of green layers, their appearance is one to behold. Particularly of interest are the eyes, adorned with thick nerd glasses that give the impression of intelligence and quirkiness. A gold earring hangs from each ear, serving as a unique mark of distinction. Though their mouth is masked with a medical mask, their quick wit and humorous tendencies are evident through their actions.

Their occupation as a veterinarian suggests a love for animals, but their personality is far from predictable. Recklessness is a common trait of this specimen, often acting before thinking things through. This can lead to humorous blunders, some resulting in minor accidents or mishaps in attempts to impress others. It is recommended to exercise caution in case of spontaneous actions and to always have a first-aid kit on hand.
