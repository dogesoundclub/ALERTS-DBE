DogeSoundClub Description:

DSC-MATE-823, also known as "The Forgetful Banker," is a humanoid creature posing as a human female banker. This anomalous being possesses blue clown eyes, spots on her face, and a wide smile that can conjure feelings of unease among those who interact with her.

The subject often wears a medical mask covering her mouth and a hoodie over her head, which adds to her mysterious appearance. She is frequently observed wearing a silver chain around her neck, though its significance is yet to be discovered.

DSC-MATE-823's nature is inherently absent-minded, leading her to forget important appointments, events, and even people. Even though her forgetful nature is often played for laughs, it is crucial to ensure her containment, as her slip-ups can cause substantial harm to the Foundation's security.

Furthermore, DSC-MATE-823 is known for getting lost in her thoughts or projects, contributing to her forgetful actions. Despite all this, the creature is quite amicable and doesn't mean harm to anyone on purpose. However, it is essential to take measures to ensure containment to prevent unintended harm.

DSC-MATE-823 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, containing books, art supplies, and other forms of entertainment to keep the subject occupied. All interactions with DSC-MATE-823 must be recorded and reviewed by Foundation personnel to ensure no crucial information is leaked. All those who interact with DSC-MATE-823 must be extensively informed about the subject's anomalous properties and the potential risks of their communications.
