ID # : DSC-MATE-2084
REPORT: ENTITY 2084 - "THE TIGER VILLAIN"

Identification Number 2084 is a sentient creature of the feline family, exhibiting markings and fur closely resembling that of a Bengal Tiger. However, its physical appearance is not the most remarkable feature that differentiates it from the rest of its kind. What sets 2084 apart is its striking set of ski goggles that he uses to mask his golden eyes, coupled with a purple cap adorned with bouffant lime-green hair. Taking his flamboyance further, an ornate gold earring dangles from the creature's left ear while a gold chain completes the foray of accessories.

Though his physical appearance may be comical, 2084 is not to be underestimated, as he aligns himself firmly on the side of evil, taking delight in wreaking havoc on unsuspecting civilians. His absent-mindedness can be misleading, making his villainous ways all the more surprising. 2084 is known to become lost in thought or deeply engrossed in a project, leading to moments of extreme forgetfulness. This characteristic has been observed to create humorous situations such as missed appointments and forgotten events. However, deep down, Entity 2084 is cunning and knows precisely the kind of chaos he needs to cause to disrupt life as we know it. So beware, citizens, for every time 2084 gets lost in thought could be the moment where he hatches his next scheme.
