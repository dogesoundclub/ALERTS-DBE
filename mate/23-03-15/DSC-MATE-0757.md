Job Title: Doctor

Species: Human

Sex: Male

Appearance:

Dr. 757 sports a head of normal blonde hair, perhaps a bit unkempt due to the restless energy that he exudes. His visage is uniquely marked by a collection of spots that dot his cheeks and forehead, almost as if he has been kissed by the stars themselves. And his eyes, oh his eyes, they glimmer with a mystical jade light that can only be described as supernatural. 

The doctor wears a simple white lab coat over his casual attire, accented with a gold chain that dangles from his neck and a single gold earring tucked behind his ear. Although his appearance may suggest a carefree attitude, Dr. 757 is a man of keen perception and intelligence. 

Personality:

He is a natural born brainstormer, whose mind is always racing with new and creative ideas. Dr. 757 enjoys presenting outlandish solutions to problems, seemingly just for the amusement of seeing others react. This adventurous spirit can at times lead him into precarious situations, but his intellect and resourcefulness more often than not enable him to harness his unique imagination to accomplish his goals.

Despite this, his dedication to medicine and the well-being of others remains his primary focus. His patients describe him as a caring, empathetic practitioner who takes an active interest in their overall health and well-being. 

Due to his exceptional intuition and intellect, Dr. 757 has become sought after by many who wish to learn from him. However, he is selective on who he chooses to teach, as he believes that knowledge should be shared with those who would use it for good. 

In summary, Dr. 757 is a brilliant, enigmatic physician whose unique talents and perspective are simultaneously fascinating and admirable.
