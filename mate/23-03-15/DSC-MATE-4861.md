DSC-MATE-4861, also known as "The Joker Boss" by the black market organizations, is a human male with distinctly unusual facial features. His face is dotted with spots, and his twisted smile exposes a set of red clown eyes that seem to glow with an otherworldly aura. He is often seen sporting a vintage cap with a two-color band around his forehead, which is accessorized with a pair of goggles. The boss also wears a medical mask across his mouth, a strange choice for someone in his line of work.

At first glance, DSC-MATE-4861's heavily pierced ears seem to be adorned with ordinary jewelry.
