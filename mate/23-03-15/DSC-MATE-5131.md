Description:

Subject 5131 is a middle-aged human male. His most notable feature is a spot on his mouth that bears a striking resemblance to a birthmark. This spot emits a faint glow that is currently unexplained.

Subject 5131's eyes are bright blue and, for reasons unknown, resemble those of a clown. He wears a purple cap with a headset, as well as a gold chain and frequently a cigarette. Despite his slightly intimidating appearance, Subject 5131 is generally laid-back and easy-going.

However, Subject 5131 is fiercely loyal to his friends and family members. Any attempt to insult or harm them will trigger an aggressive response from Subject 5131. This phenomenon often leads to comical situations, as the subject will engage in heated arguments with those who pose a threat to his loved ones.

Foundation personnel noted the subject's unusual appearance and identified him as a potential DSC-XXXX candidate. Following thorough testing, Subject 5131 was deemed to be anomalous and was subsequently contained. Further research is ongoing.
