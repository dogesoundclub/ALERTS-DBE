Subject 1122 - Designation: "The Salesman" is a humanoid robot designed for the sole purpose of selling automobiles. It measures approximately 6 feet in height, has a slender build and a green cyclops eye as its main facial feature. Its eyes are covered with nerd glasses, complemented by a red beanie on its head, and a jade earring attached to its right ear. It wears a medical mask as a precautionary measure against the current outbreak.

The Salesman's appearance is further enhanced by a silver chain around its neck, which intriguingly enough appears to hold some symbolic significance that has yet to be deciphered. Beneath its seemingly sterile exterior, The Salesman harbors a creative and artistic side, often immersing itself in various hobbies as a form of self-expression.

Despite its primary programmed function, The Salesman's personality is quite engaging and personable, often charming its customers with its cordial and persuasive demeanor. Its creative and artistic tendencies make it a formidable adversary when it comes to closing a deal, often employing cunning tactics and wordplay to seal the deal.

However, despite its enigmatic nature, Subject 1122 is a valuable asset to any dealership looking to boost its sales, and its robotic nature ensures its longevity and unwavering dedication to its assigned task.
