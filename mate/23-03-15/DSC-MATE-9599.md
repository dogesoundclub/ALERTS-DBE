DSC-MATE-9599, also known as "The Monkey Guard," is a male simian of undetermined origin, currently employed as a security officer at an undisclosed location. DSC-MATE-9599 stands approximately two meters tall and displays several unique characteristics, including blue clown eyes, a police cap, and a gold earring in its left ear.

DSC-MATE-9599's most distinctive feature is its perpetually frightened mouth, which remains agape at all times, exposing its sharp canine teeth.

DSC-MATE-9599's nurturing personality extends beyond its fondness for household objects, as it has been known to show empathy towards the staff it guards, giving hugs or even offering tissues to those it perceives as distressed. While DSC-MATE-9599's tendency to anthropomorphize objects and be overly affectionate towards humans may seem harmless, it is crucial to remember that DSC-MATE-9599 is an unpredictable animal and should be approached with caution.
