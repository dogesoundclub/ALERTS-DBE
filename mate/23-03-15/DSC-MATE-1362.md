DSC-MATE-1362, also known by their human name Dr. Harper, is a veterinarian specializing in treating supernatural creatures. As a human, they have orange stripes on their face, a prominent orange side on their head, and are often seen wearing a jade earring in one ear. Their eyes are VR Jade LED, which may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the world of the supernatural, but is not uncommon in those who deal with it regularly.

Dr. Harper is a reliable and organized individual, which is a beneficial trait for anyone dealing with the unpredictable world of the paranormal. However, they can be quite stubborn when it comes to change or accepting new ideas, which can lead to some humorously awkward moments when encountering unexpected situations.

Despite their quirks, Dr. Harper is an expert in their field, and their choker serves as a reminder that they are not to be underestimated. Engaging with them respectfully and with an open mind is crucial when dealing with the supernatural, and Dr. Harper is no exception.
