Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 9808 is to be allowed to continue their employment as a delivery driver, with knowledge of their unique appearance and abilities limited to Foundation personnel only. Subject is not to be allowed contact with any anomalous objects or information during their employment. 

Description:
Subject 9808 is a human male with distinctive physical features. Their mouth is marked by a large, circular spot that is a dark red color. Their eyes are semi-transparent jade LED screens, which display various text and images, most notably a moving V-for-Vendetta mask. Their head, which is shaved down the middle and dyed pink on either side, is scarred as if from a recent surgery. They bear a jade earring on one ear and frequently wear a deep red scarf. Subject is often seen smoking a cigarette, but appears immune to any ill effects from smoking.

One notable aspect of subjectâ€™s personality is their strong analytical and logical thinking patterns. They enjoy debating and arguing with others, even over seemingly trivial or unimportant matters. However, this sometimes leads to humorous situations, where subject becomes heated over the outcome of an argument. 

Additional notes:
There have been no reports of subject using any anomalous ability, but due to their unique appearance, they should be monitored closely for any potential additional abilities. A background investigation showed no criminal record, and subject is considered a model employee at their delivery company.
