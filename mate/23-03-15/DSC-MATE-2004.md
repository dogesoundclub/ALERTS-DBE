ID # : DSC-MATE-2004
DSC-MATE-2004, known by its designation as "The Voltage Hopper", is a highly unusual specimen of the rabbit species with exceptional knowledge in electrical systems. Dressed in a hoodie, donning a silver chain, and carrying a whistle on a cord, 2004 seems to have a knack for detecting the slightest inconsistencies in electric wiring systems.

As its abilities are directly linked to electrical fields, 2004's eyes are of irrelative importance, being often unseen behind its hoodie's hood. Its personality is one of utmost attention and detail, making it an extremely competent electrician. However, its concern for perfection often leads to excessive research on decisions, such as purchasing gifts.

When exposed to excessive electrical fields, DSC-MATE-2004 enters a state of hyper-alertness that allows it to perceive and manipulate energy in ways not yet fully understood. However, the Foundation has been avidly working to comprehend 2004's abilities fully, with significant progress being made.

As a result, due to its intrinsic value to the Foundation, 2004 is to be kept in a secured environment, with all personnel advised to take the utmost precautions when in the vicinity of the rabbit.
