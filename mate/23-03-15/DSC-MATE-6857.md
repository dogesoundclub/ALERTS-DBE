ID # : DSC-MATE-6857
DSC identification number 6857 is an anomalous firefighter, regarded as one of the most unpredictable members of the Foundation's urban fantasy division. This creature takes the form of a male rabbit, with a head that is oddly not arranged in a typical manner, the shade of green indicating a clear lack of conformity with natural law. 

Further examination reveals that 6857 is adorned with a single gold earring, which may serve as his personal token of individuality. A lit cigarette seems to be his preferred form of accessory, which despite not being a suitable item for someone in his profession, he stubbornly clings onto.

Personality-wise, 6857 can be quite the wild card. Despite being equipped with a honed set of firefighting skills, it should be noted that this creature has a tendency to get sidetracked due to its scatterbrained nature, with forgetfulness and a habit of getting lost on the way to appointments not uncommon occurrences.

While these traits have been known to cause some humorous situations for those around him, they can also spell potential disaster when it comes to containing and responding to urban fantasy anomalies. The Foundation's staff would be well-advised to exercise caution around DSC 6857 in the field to minimize collateral damage.
