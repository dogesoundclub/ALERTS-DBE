Item #: 4906

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4906 is to be allowed to continue her normal life as a news anchor, as long as she does not display any unusual behaviors or abilities. She has been advised not to use her abilities in public or in front of anyone who is not authorized to know about them. She is to be closely monitored by undercover agents to ensure her cooperation.

Description:

Subject 4906 is a human female with spots on her face, and VR Jade LED eyes that can change color according to her mood. Her head is orange side, and her ears have a green cross earring. She wears a gold chain as an accessory. 

Subject 4906's abilities include a tendency towards introspection, and she can easily get lost in thought or daydreaming. Her absent-mindedness can lead to humorous situations such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something. However, her daydreams often take her to strange places that are not easily explained. She claims that these visions are just her imagination, but we cannot be sure.

Addendum: 

In light of recent incidents involving anomalies being exposed to the public, it has been recommended that Subject 4906 be transferred to a more secure location. However, due to her position as a news anchor and the potential for public panic, it has been decided that she will remain in her current position. She will be told that it is for her own safety, and that she is only being moved due to a network restructuring. Nevertheless, agents will keep a close eye on her to ensure that she does not pose a threat to just "humorously" herself or the general population.
