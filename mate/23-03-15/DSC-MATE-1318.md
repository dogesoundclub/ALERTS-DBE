Subject 1318, also known as "The Simian Officer," is a male monkey who works as a police officer. Weighing in at approximately 35 lbs, 1318 sports a frightened mouth, accentuated by his horned rim glasses that rest atop his wrinkled face. He wears a hoodie on his head, complete with a two-color band on his forehead. A red scarf is often seen wrapped around his neck, adding to his unique personality. 

However, don't underestimate 1318's abilities as an officer. Despite his appearance, he is equipped with a whistle, which he uses to issue commands and signal for backup. His nurturing personality often leads him to take care of his friends and family, treating them as he would his own children. 

While some may question his ability to handle difficult situations, 1318 has proven to be an effective and reliable member of the police force. His unique appearance and personality allow him to approach situations with a different perspective, often leading to unexpected solutions. 

As with all DSCs, caution should be exercised when interacting with Subject 1318. However, if treated with respect and allowed to carry out his duties, he will prove to be a valued asset to any police force.
