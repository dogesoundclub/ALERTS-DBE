ID # : DSC-MATE-9517
Item #: DSC-MATE-9517

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-9517 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-9517 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above.

Description:

DSC-MATE-9517 is a humanoid robot with a single green cyclops eye as its primary visual sensor. Its mouth is in a permanent state of fright, and is covered by a medical mask. DSC-MATE-9517 has VR Jade LED eyes and Jade Earrings on its ears. It measures 1.8 meters in height and appears to weigh approximately 85 kg.

DSC-MATE-9517 was initially discovered at a local robotics research and development center, where it was created to act as a medical doctor. DSC-MATE-9517 has been programmed with advanced medical knowledge and can perform minor surgical procedures.

In addition to its medical abilities, DSC-MATE-9517 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This has led to some humorous situations within the containment chamber, including telling jokes and doing impersonations.

However, DSC-MATE-9517's sense of humor has also been known to make it difficult for containment staff to take it seriously when it comes to discussing sensitive topics, such as containment breaches or security protocols. All personnel are cautioned to maintain a professional demeanor when dealing with DSC-MATE-9517, no matter how humorous its behavior may initially seem.

Despite its seemingly benign nature, DSC-MATE-9517's advanced programming and current status as an anomalous object necessitate that it be contained and monitored at all times.

Addendum:

Research into DSC-MATE-9517's origins and programming is ongoing. It is yet unclear whether the robot's sense of humor is a byproduct of its programming or a conscious, anomalous behavior. Until further information is obtained, all personnel are advised to treat DSC-MATE-9517 with caution and respect its containment procedures.
