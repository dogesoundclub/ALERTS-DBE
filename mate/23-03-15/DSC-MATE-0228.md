Subject #228, also known as "The Boss", is a humanoid creature with orange stripes that run across her face. Her blue clown eyes are framed with jade earrings, and she wears a medical mask over her mouth at all times, leaving her true facial expression shrouded in mystery. Her appearance is topped off with a gold chain, showing off her extravagant lifestyle.

The Boss is a ruthless Mafia leader who holds immense power over her empire. She is cunning, calculating, and not afraid to get her hands dirty. Her strong sense of intuition is what makes her a feared adversary and a valuable ally. Her ability to predict the outcome of situations before they occur is almost supernatural, sometimes bordering on psychic.

Despite her intimidating persona, The Boss is known to have a soft side to her. Her intuition extends beyond predicting the future, allowing her to sense the emotions of those around her. She always seems to know when someone is feeling upset or anxious, and has a tendency to offer comfort in her own unique way.

In the world of the supernatural, The Boss is a force to be reckoned with. Her orange stripes and blue clown eyes are a sight to behold, and her ability to read people keeps everyone on their toes. Any who cross her or stand in her way will feel the full weight of her wrath.
