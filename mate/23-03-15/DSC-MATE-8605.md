Subject 8605, also known as The Clown, is a notorious Mafia Boss known for his erratic and unpredictable behavior. His human appearance is marked by distinct spots on his face, paired with a perpetually unsettling smile. But it is his eyes that truly set him apart from ordinary men - a blazing red, eerily resembling those of a clown.

Jet black hair, styled into a sharp crew cut, frames his face, which is often adorned with a bright red beanie with pompom on the top. His left ear boasts a striking jade earring, adding a touch of the exotic to his otherwise gritty appearance. A thick gold chain often hangs from his neck, a symbol of his status and power.

His personality is reflective of his appearance and his role - impulsive, and often dangerous in equal measures. He is known for his hot-headed outbursts and tendency to act on his emotions without much forethought, leading to many humorous yet unpredictable situations in the Mafia world. 

One should approach The Clown with caution, for he is a master of deception and trickery, often using his uncanny ability to read peopleâ€™s emotions and insecurities against them. He can be a deadly foe, but also a loyal ally to those who earn his trust. His reputation precedes him, and he is widely feared by all who know of him.
