ID # : DSC-MATE-489
DSC-MATE-489 is a peculiar character indeed. As a veterinarian, they possess a keen sense of empathy and understanding towards all animals, not just those who are their patients. However, it is their own appearance that has drawn the attention of urban fantasy enthusiasts.

DSC-MATE-489 appears as a male rabbit with a frightened mouth, giving the impression that they are easily startled or intimidated. Their eyes are covered by horned rim glasses, concealing their true expressions, but also adding a touch of sophistication to their demeanor. The rabbit wears a bucket hat, which may seem out of place on an animal but somehow fits perfectly on DSC-MATE-489.

What truly sets DSC-MATE-489 apart, however, is the Jade earring they wear on one of their ears. The earring appears to be magical in nature, and often emits a faint aura of green light. As if this were not enough, DSC-MATE-489 also wears a gold chain around their neck, as well as a cigarette in their mouth.

Despite their rather unique appearance, DSC-MATE-489 is known to have a great sense of humor. They enjoy making others laugh and may often be found telling jokes or doing impressions. This lightheartedness can be infectious and has been known to lift the spirits of many a downhearted urban fantasy enthusiast.

However, it is important to handle DSC-MATE-489 with care, as their earring and other accessories may hold powers beyond our understanding. Approach with caution, and do not underestimate this playful and sometimes mischievous rabbit.
