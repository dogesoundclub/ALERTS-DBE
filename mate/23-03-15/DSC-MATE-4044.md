ID # : DSC-MATE-4044
DogeSoundClub Field Report - Identification Number 4044

Subject 4044 is a male monkey of unknown origin currently working as a fast food worker in █████████. The subject's most notable feature is its frightened mouth, which appears to be in a constant state of anxiety. Additionally, 4044's head is equipped with a headset fitted with LED lights.

Although we are yet to classify the specific species of 4044, recent behavioral observations suggest that it may belong to a previously unknown primate family. In personality tests conducted on 4044, it was evident that the subject is incredibly caring and nurturing, often taking care of its friends and family members as if they were its own children.

It is essential to note that the staff at the fast-food restaurant where Subject 4044 works appear to be unaware of its anomalous properties. As such, we at the DogeSoundClub suggest close monitoring and discreet observation to avoid any potential complications while conducting further research on this unique primate.

Further analysis and study are currently ongoing, and additional reports will be filed according to protocol as developments arise.
