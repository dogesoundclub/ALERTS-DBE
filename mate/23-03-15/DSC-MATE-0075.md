Description:
Subject 75 is a Homo sapien male with notable features that set him apart from the population. Subject appears to be a typical, presentable banker with a charming smile, but upon closer inspection, it is revealed that subject's eyes are a curious shade of blue, resembling that of a clown's. The subject's head is covered by a short peak cap, while jade earring pierces the ear, creating an aesthetically pleasing and attention- grabbing look. Additionally, subject is often seen wearing a bold red scarf - a clear attempt to make themselves stand out in a crowd.

Personality:
Subject 75 is known to be a natural brainstormer, displaying qualities of creativity and resourcefulness. They enjoy testing boundaries and coming up with new, out-of-the-box solutions, even if they seem unpractical to others. In some cases, their tendency to brainstorm can be seen as humorous, as the ideas presented can be downright silly or outrageous. Nevertheless, it is important to note that subject's gift for creative problem-solving can be potentially dangerous in the wrong hands, particularly when it comes to the manipulation of financial systems.

Further investigation into the nature of Subject 75 is ongoing.
