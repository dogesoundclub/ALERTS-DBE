DogeSoundClub Containment Report:
Subject Identification Number 1679, also known as the "Politician," is a humanoid creature of the species Human. Its physical appearance is distinctive, with bright red clown eyes and green layers on its head, topped with a single jade earring in the left ear. Its resemblance to a clown raises concerns about anomalous properties, but no supernatural elements have been found so far.

The Politician's job is a matter of intrigue, as its position in public office could potentially lead to serious breaches of containment. There are fears that Subject 1679 could utilize its political powers for malevolent purposes, but so far, such actions have not been observed.

What is of note about Subject 1679 is its unique personality. Despite being a public figure, it is highly sociable and has a great sense of humor. The politician is the life of the party, and its favorite songs often get everyone dancing and singing along. Its sense of duty and responsibility has not been compromised by its sociable nature, leading to some questioning if this is an act or not.

Attempts to contain Subject 1679 have proven difficult as it is highly charismatic and can quickly convince people to do its bidding. It poses a significant risk to the Foundation's secrecy if allowed to roam free.

A detailed containment plan has been put in place, limiting interactions with the Politician to a minimum. Regular psychological evaluations of the subject are conducted to monitor for any potential signs of anomalous behavior. The subject's cigarette is not to be confiscated unless it appears to cause a change in behavior. Further information will be presented as it is obtained.
