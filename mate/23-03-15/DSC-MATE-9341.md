Item #: 9341

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 9341 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring no less than 4 x 4 x 4 meters. The cell must be outfitted with basic amenities such as a bed, toilet, and desk for the subject's comfort. Subject 9341 must be provided with a daily intake of bananas to keep its blood sugar level up, but any other food items must be approved by the on-site medical team.

Description:
Subject 9341 is a male monkey approximately 1 meter tall, weighing around 30 kg. The subject is identified by its distinct blue clown eyes and green hair tied up in a purple cap. The subject is also noted for its gold earring, which it refuses to take off at any time. 9341 has shown high levels of intelligence and logic through various tests conducted by the Foundation staff, making them exceptionally useful as weapon mechanics. 

The subject's personality is known for its stoic, analytical, and quirky tendencies. They display an affinity for humor in a deadpan, dry way and enjoy making witty observations and teasing their friends, making it difficult for the staff to form a bond of trust with the subject. However, the subject thrives in a structured environment and appears to be happiest when working on complex mechanical or electrical problems.

Subject 9341 was discovered wandering in the streets of ██████, appearing to have escaped from a local circus or zoo. When approached, the subject displayed exceptional intelligence and demonstrated the ability to speak multiple languages fluently. The Foundation was alerted, and the subject was swiftly relocated to a containment facility for further study.

Addendum:
After several months of observation, it was discovered that subject 9341 had developed a preference for a Foundation scientist named Dr. ███████. Subject 9341 would go out of its way to make Dr. ███████ laugh and even began leaving bananas for them as a token of affection. It is recommended that further study be conducted to determine the implications of the subject's emotional attachments to the staff.
