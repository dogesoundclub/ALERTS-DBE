ID # : DSC-MATE-9420
Item #: 9420

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 9420 is to be monitored by Field Agents at all times while on the job. In the event of an unexpected outburst or erratic behavior, tranquilizer darts are to be used immediately to subdue the subject. The subject is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell that is equipped with a climbing structure.

Description:

Subject 9420 is a male monkey that stands at 3 feet tall. The subject is almost always seen wearing a police cap, normal glasses, and may be sporting a gold earring. Subject 9420 is identifiable by their signature red scarf and whistle that they wear around their neck.

The subject works as a traffic officer for a large city in the United States, and it is unknown how they were able to obtain this position. They have successfully delegated traffic flow while conducting themselves within the laws of the state in which they serve.

Subject 9420 displays characteristics that are not typical of most primates. They are highly analytical, logical, and have a love for debating for fun, which can make for some interesting and humorous discussions. They have instigated debates on various topics, even those deemed trivial or unimportant.

It is not yet known how Subject 9420 was imbued with human-like qualities or if they are even truly a monkey. Further research is required to determine if they pose any danger to society at large.

Addendum 9420-1:

On ██/██/20██, Subject 9420 was observed by an agent in a heated argument with a human suspected of illegal activity. The subject inexplicably and unexpectedly transformed into a humanoid hybrid form, which caused panic in nearby pedestrians. The agent took immediate action and subdued the subject with tranquilizer darts. The subject regained their primate form and had no recollection of the incident.

After this occurrence, it is clear that Subject 9420 requires further containment protocols, and the threat level has been elevated to Euclid. Research into the origins of the subject is ongoing, and additional staff have been assigned to the case.
