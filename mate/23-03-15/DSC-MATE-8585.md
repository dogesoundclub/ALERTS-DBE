ID # : DSC-MATE-8585
DSC-MATE-8585, also known as "The Monkey Farmer," is a male simian creature that stands at roughly 1.5 meters tall. His wide, frightened mouth is the most distinguishing feature of his face, while his blue clown eyes seem to be constantly darting around, searching for threats. He is often seen sporting a bucket hat on his head and a gold earring in each of his large, hairy ears.

In addition to these accessories, DSC-MATE-8585 wears a silver chain around his neck and carries a whistle in his pocket at all times. These objects seem to be of great importance to him, though their exact significance is not yet clear.

The Monkey Farmer's personality is characterized by an almost obsessive attention to detail, which can manifest in strange and unexpected ways. He is known to alphabetize his spice rack and color-code his closet with military precision. Despite this tendency towards orderliness, he can also be skittish and easily startled.

DSC-MATE-8585's job as a farmer is currently under investigation by the Foundation, as it is unclear how a simian creature could hold such a position. Further observations and interviews with the subject are necessary to determine the true extent of his capabilities and potential anomalous properties, if any.
