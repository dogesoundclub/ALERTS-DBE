ID # : DSC-MATE-7800
Containment Procedures:

Identification number 7800, also known as "The Rebel", is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with sensory deprivation technology and monitored by a minimum of two armed guards at all times. All communications between 7800 and any outside parties must first be approved by Level 4 personnel.

Description:

7800 has the appearance of a human male, with distinct orange stripes on his face, and wears nerd glasses and a red beanie. A two-color band adorns his forehead, with a goggle on top, and he typically drapes a red scarf around his neck. Despite his seemingly harmless appearance, 7800 has been classified as a villain and should be considered dangerous at all times.

Personality:

7800 exhibits a strong sense of independence and a resistance to authority or unnecessary rules. He is prone to rebellious behaviors, such as sneaking out of the office or taking unauthorized days off. 7800 should be interacted with carefully and with caution, as any attempts at dictating his behavior may lead to unpredictable reactions.

Notes:

It is suspected that 7800 has connections to several other known villains and may be involved in illicit activities. Further investigation is recommended, and any information obtained from 7800 should be treated with skepticism.
