ID # : DSC-MATE-4336
Subject 4336 is a dangerous and unpredictable villain operating within the urban landscape. Despite being a member of the human species, their appearance is anything but ordinary. Sporting orange stripes on their face, a purple cap adorned with a headset atop their head, and jade earrings dangling from their ears, 4336 embodies an image of rebellion and chaos.

Their medical mask serves as a constant reminder of the threat they pose to society and the danger that lurks behind those enigmatic features. Their personality follows suit, as they constantly seek out ways to push the boundaries and test the limits of the world around them.

4336 finds humor in exploiting rules and regulations meant to keep them in check and is always looking for ways to bend them to their will. Their rebellious nature makes them a wild card in any given scenario, an unpredictable force that cannot be tamed or trusted.

The Foundation advises all parties to exercise extreme caution when dealing with this subject and to report any sightings or interactions immediately to the appropriate authorities. 4336 is not to be taken lightly, and any attempt to engage or apprehend them without proper preparation can result in dire consequences.
