ID # : DSC-MATE-4280
DSC-MATE-4280, codenamed "The Festival Guard," is a human female with distinct orange stripes adorning her face and vibrant purple lips. However, it is her eyes that truly capture one's attention - brilliant blue clown eyes that exude both excitement and caution.

Donning a headpiece reminiscent of a colorful, lively carnival or festival, DSC-MATE-4280 also wears an LED gas mask as her primary accessory. The mask not only provides a stark contrast to her festivity attire but also serves a practical purpose, aiding in her work as a security guard within the Foundation.

Despite her seemingly whimsical appearance, DSC-MATE-4280 is a professional through and through. She values tradition and carries an inherent no-nonsense attitude. However, her playful side has been known to surface, resulting in humorous situations where she uses jokes or stories passed down from her family or community.

DSC-MATE-4280 is a reliable and valuable asset to the Foundation, bringing a unique, and entertaining, presence to any assignment. However, as with all personnel, it is crucial to remember that she remains a human and should be treated accordingly.
