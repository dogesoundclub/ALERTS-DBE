Subject 6632, aka Officer V, is an enigmatic figure often seen patrolling the streets in his official uniform. With a mouth spot adorning his visage and a smile that could warm the coldest of hearts, Officer V is a creature of curiosity and constant observation.

Behind his nerdy glasses, which he uses to peer into the darkest corners of the city, he dons a goggle on his forehead - a tool that aids him in his quest for knowledge. He never misses a detail, no matter how insignificant, and often surprises his colleagues with his wealth of mostly useless information.

Despite his friendly demeanor, Officer V always wears a medical mask that covers his mouth - a reminder that there are darker forces at work in the city's underbelly. He is always alert, never letting his guard down in the presence of danger.

Officer V is not just a curious observer of the world; he is also a collector of sorts. His gold chain, paired with a gold earring dangling from his ear, are symbols of the treasures he has amassed over the years - trinkets and curiosities that pique his interest.

He may seem like a harmless traffic officer, but Officer V is always watching, learning, and gathering intel on the strange and unusual. He is a vital link in the chain that keeps the city's supernatural secrets safe from prying eyes.
