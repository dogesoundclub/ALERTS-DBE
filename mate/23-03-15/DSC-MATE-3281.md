Subject 3281, also known as "The Designer," is a human female with striking features that are sure to catch anyone's attention. Her face is adorned with vivid orange stripes, creating an alluring contrast to her vibrant blue clown eyes that seem to sparkle with mischief. Her jovial expression is eternally marked by an infectious smile that is nothing short of intoxicating.

She stands tall with a playful confidence, accompanied by the iconic pig-tailed hairstyle that frames her face. Attached to her forehead is a sleek set of goggles, giving her a unique and stylish edge. Her ears are adorned with opulent gold earrings that seem to shimmer in the light. The ever-present cigarette dangling from her lips completes her undeniable charm.

Beyond her striking appearance, The Designer has a personality that is just as magnetic. Her strong sense of independence makes her resistant to any form of authority or rules that she deems unnecessary. She refuses to be held down, often engaging in rebellious behavior that includes sneaking out of her office early or taking a day off without permission.

In the bustling world of urban fantasy, it is rare to find an individual that exudes such an intriguing aura as The Designer. She is a force to be reckoned with, commanding attention everywhere she goes, be it in a crowded fashion show or the dark, shadowy alleys of the city.
