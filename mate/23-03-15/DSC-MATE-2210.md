ID # : DSC-MATE-2210
Item #2210 is a prime specimen of Homo sapiens, also known as the "Programmer." This individual stands at an average height, with a wide grin that stretches across his face. His eyes are covered by normal glasses, seeming to mask any overt peculiarities. However, upon closer inspection, peculiarities may be observed.

The individual's head is covered by what appears to be green layers, like some sort of technological armor. Resting atop his forehead are a pair of goggles, which perhaps hint at a deep fascination with virtual or augmented reality. This love of technology extends to the individual's choice of mouthwear, as he sports a medical mask, perhaps to protect himself from airborne toxins or viruses.

A silver chain dangles from around the individual's neck, adding a touch of bling to the otherwise tech-heavy outfit. But do not let the technological trappings deceive you â€“ this individual possesses a great sense of humor, and enjoys making those around him laugh. Whether through funny stories or silly impersonations, he is known to lighten the mood and bring a levity to even the darkest of situations. Proceed with caution, as any encounter with Item #2210 may result in uncontrollable bouts of laughter.
