DSC-MATE-9157, also known by his human name "Monk," is an enigmatic mechanic known for his peculiar appearance and insatiable thirst for knowledge. His most notable distinguishing feature is the peculiar "Mouth Spot" on his face, which resembles a birthmark in the shape of a small circle near his lips.

Despite being human, Monk's insatiable curiosity manifests itself in unusual ways, often leading him down dark and dangerous paths in pursuit of the unknown. He is known to be an avid smoker, often carrying his cigarette as a unique addition to his ensemble, along with his trusty silver chain.

While he generally remains stoic and quiet, his interest in obscure and unusual topics frequently leads him into humorous situations, where he randomly spouts off obscure facts and trivia to unsuspecting bystanders.

Monk is a valuable resource for the Foundation, and his mechanical aptitude is often leveraged to maintain and repair anomalous vehicles and machinery. However, his insatiable curiosity can be a double-edged sword, and the Foundation must remain vigilant in monitoring his activities to ensure the safety of all involved.
