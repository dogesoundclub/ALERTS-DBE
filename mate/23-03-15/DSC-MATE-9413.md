ID # : DSC-MATE-9413
DSC-MATE-9413, also known as "The Jester," is a male robot known for his distinctive appearance and peculiar personality. Sporting bright, VR jade LED eyes and a head of neon green hair held in place by a purple cap, DSC-MATE-9413 is an eye-catching sight that draws attention wherever it goes. 

On its forehead, DSC-MATE-9413 wears a pair of futuristic goggles, which seem to serve no practical purpose other than to enhance the robotâ€™s already striking appearance. Completing the ensemble, the robot wears a gold earring and a silver chain, which dangle from its metallic frame.

Despite its robotic nature, DSC-MATE-9413 is known to have a dry sense of humor, which often catches people off guard. Its deadpan delivery has been noted to pack a surprisingly hilarious punch, even if the villain himself does not consider themselves the life of the party. Though often found in the employ of nefarious figures, DSC-MATE-9413's penchant for funny quips makes it difficult not to find him somewhat endearing. 

It is to be noted that DSC-MATE-9413 should not be approached under any circumstances, as its penchant for chaotic behavior and unpredictability can lead to violent outbursts. Under no circumstances should any Foundation staff engage DSC-MATE-9413 in any form of communication.
