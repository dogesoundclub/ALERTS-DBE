Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1070 was recovered from a small rural community in the Midwest United States after reports of a mysterious infection emerged. The Foundation became involved after it was determined that the source of the outbreak was linked to DSC-MATE-1070.

All those who came into contact with DSC-MATE-1070 were immediately quarantined and the area where it was found was placed under surveillance.  It is still unknown how DSC-MATE-1070 contracted the bacterium which causes the infection, or how it is able to communicate with inanimate objects. Research into DSC-MATE-1070 is ongoing.
