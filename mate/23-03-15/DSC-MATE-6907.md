Foundation personnel, meet 6907, the programmer. This human subject displays notable facial spots, but do not be fooled – they are friendly and approachable. Their stunning smile will put you at ease, but be wary of locking eyes with them: their VR Jade LED eyes may cause disorientation.

6907 is often seen donning a hoodie, and accessorizing with a silver chain and an LED gas mask. These may appear to be a bit strange at first, but rest assured that they are simply decorative accents. 

The subject's personality is perhaps their most intriguing attribute. They possess an empathetic and compassionate nature, always willing to help those in need. However, this can sometimes be a double-edged sword, as they may take on too much responsibility for the problems of others. Nonetheless, their admirable qualities cannot be ignored – 6907 is a valuable addition to any team.
