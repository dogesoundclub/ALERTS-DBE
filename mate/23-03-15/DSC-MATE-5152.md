ID # : DSC-MATE-5152
DSC-MATE-5152, also known as "The Lucky Hare," is a male rabbit of unknown age and origin. Upon further investigation, DSC-MATE-5152 was discovered to possess the ability to transform into a humanoid form and works as a lawyer among humans.

DSC-MATE-5152 has normal glasses which are used to enhance their legal skills, and they are often seen wearing a police cap as a symbol of their authority in both their worlds. Additionally, they wear a gold earring on one of their ears, a red scarf around their neck, and carry a candy stick around with them as an energy source.

DSC-MATE-5152's personality is characterized by their introverted nature, where they tend to spend most of their time lost in thought and daydreaming. This peculiarity has resulted in several comedic situations where DSC-MATE-5152 has accidentally unlocked themselves from their rabbit form and walked into poles or tripped over objects.

Despite being a creature of pure fantasy, DSC-MATE-5152 possesses a deep understanding of the law, which makes them a valuable asset to the Foundation in navigating the complexities and intricacies of inter-species legislation. DSC-MATE-5152 is to be kept under close scrutiny at all times and is only allowed to leave containment for legal work purposes approved by the Foundation.
