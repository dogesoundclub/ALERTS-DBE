Subject 3423, also known as "The Robot Doctor", is a most peculiar creature. With its bright green Cyclops eye, adorned with a pair of horned rim glasses, it can see through the most stubborn of medical complexities. Its head is topped with a Doge hat, and its ears are graced with a red cross earring, giving off an appearance of being an adept healer.

As a robot, this enigmatic doctor has a set of metal limbs with mechanical digits that can perform intricate procedures and saves lives in the most critical cases. Its silver chain rests on its torso, carrying essential tools of the trade.

However, what sets 3423 apart from its kind is its highly imaginative and creative way of thinking, leading to many unexpected interests and hobbies. It may spend its free hours writing poetry, inventing new medical devices, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, or amassing collections of the most unusual objects.

Thus, as much as this robot is a highly skilled doctor, it is also a fascinating and complex character with depths yet to be discovered. DogeSoundClub has classified it as safe for now, but one never knows what lurks behind the mind of the Robot Doctor.
