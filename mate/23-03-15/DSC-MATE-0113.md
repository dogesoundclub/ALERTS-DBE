DSC-MATE-113 is to be provided with a selection of books relating to car sales to aid with its job.

Description:

DSC-MATE-113 is a male rabbit that currently works as a car salesman in a local dealership. Its face features a constant look of terror, and its eyes are not visible as it wears a headset with LED lights. DSC-MATE-113 has an insatiable thirst for knowledge, particularly obscure and esoteric subjects related to psychology, human behavior, and salesmanship. DSC-MATE-113 spends most of its free time reading books or watching documentaries and is always eager to share its newfound knowledge with anyone who will listen. DSC-MATE-113's personality is characterized by an awkward and overly friendly demeanor, making it difficult to determine its true intentions.

DSC-MATE-113's anomalous properties manifest when it attempts to sell a car. Its sales pitch is incredibly effective and manipulative, resulting in the successful sale of almost any vehicle it shows. The exact mechanism behind this ability is unknown, but it has been observed that DSC-MATE-113 can tailor its pitch to a customer's individual desires, making them more likely to purchase the vehicle. Despite its beneficial effects, DSC-MATE-113's ability to manipulate customers during a sales pitch is considered a significant security risk.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-113 was recovered from a used car dealership after several reports were made about suspiciously successful sales made by a salesman. Foundation personnel were unable to verify DSC-MATE-113's method of manipulating customers, but the individual was deemed a threat to existing security protocols and contained accordingly. Further research into DSC-MATE-113's abilities is ongoing.
