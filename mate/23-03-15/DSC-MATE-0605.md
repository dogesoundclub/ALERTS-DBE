ID # : DSC-MATE-605
Name: Agent 605, Real Estate Specialist

Special Containment Procedures:
Agent 605 is to be monitored at all times, and his access to sensitive information must be limited. Any gift-giving occasions should be closely monitored and approved by higher-ups to ensure that his choice of gift does not pose a security risk. Any gift given by him must be carefully examined before being passed on to the recipient.

Description:
Agent 605 appears as a human male, with distinctive spots covering his face. Despite this, his smile is infectious and invites trust. He has red clown eyes, which add to his jovial appearance, but observers should be warned that this is not simply a costume. His head is not arranged properly, and features a two-color band on his forehead. He wears a jade earring in each ear and always has a medical mask covering his mouth.

Personality:
Agent 605 is highly observant, with an eye for detail that makes him an excellent real estate agent. However, this can also make him overly concerned with gift-giving, to the point of being obsessive. He spends hours agonizing over the perfect gift, and any character flaws or weaknesses of the recipient that he perceives can become deeply embedded in his gift choices. He is a charming conversationalist, able to put people at ease in negotiations, yet always has an ulterior motive. 

In summary, Agent 605 may appear friendly and non-threatening, but his demeanor belies a darker, more obsessive side. His gift-giving tendencies could potentially pose a security threat, which is why he must be carefully monitored at all times.
