Subject 622, codenamed "The Tiger Mechanic," is a humanoid entity resembling a Bengal tiger in both appearance and demeanor. Its physical features include a pair of oversized nerd glasses covering its amber-colored eyes, a red beanie firmly planted on top of its furred head, and a red cross earring dangling from one ear. However, what sets this subject apart the most is the frightened expression that is constantly displayed across its mouth, often hidden behind a medical mask.

The Tiger Mechanic can be best described as a social butterfly, possessing an innate charm and charisma that can quickly make it the center of attention. It is not uncommon for this subject to break into song or dance randomly to entertain those around it, often eliciting laughter in the process. This playful trait, combined with its natural curiosity and mechanical inclination, has made it a valuable asset among the Foundation's engineering teams.

When not involved in its duties as a mechanic, The Tiger Mechanic can usually be found socializing with other humanoid entities, telling jokes and exchanging stories. Its upbeat personality can often make it seem carefree, but it is important to remember that this is still a highly intelligent and capable creature, one that should not be underestimated. However, its lighthearted nature and willingness to connect with others make it a beloved member of the Foundation's staff. All interactions with the subject should be monitored closely to ensure that its unusual nature does not result in any potentially hazardous situations.
