Subject 9164, also known as "The Reporter," is a unique specimen of the human species. Her appearance is immediately noticeable with her bright orange stripes that adorn her face, coupled with her striking red lips that seem to pulse with a life of their own. However, what truly sets her apart is her eyes- a mesmerizing VR Rainbow LED that shines brightly like a beacon in the darkness.

Most commonly spotted in her signature hoodie, the Reporter is never without her trusted gold chain that holds a mysterious symbol of unknown origin. In addition to this, she also carries a rather mundane accessory: a gas mask, which seems to serve primarily as an aesthetic choice rather than practicality.

The Reporter's personality is as dynamic as her appearance. She is a spontaneous thrill-seeker who relishes taking risks and doing things on a whim. Her impulsive nature often leads her into humorous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river. Nothing seems to deter her from chasing a good story, however dangerous it may be.

While the nature of her work and investigating the paranormal may seem like an unusual match, the Reporter's unwavering curiosity and unorthodox approach have enabled her to uncover some of the most fascinating and terrifying tales that lurk in the shadows of the city.  It is recommended to approach her with caution, as she has been known to have a protective streak towards her sources and will go to great lengths to protect them.
