ID # : DSC-MATE-6735
DSC-MATE-6735 or "The Traffic Warden" is a peculiar humanoid entity of synthetic kind, masquerading as a traffic officer. The entity, which appears to be male in gender, is outfitted in a cumbersome hoodie that obscures most of its body, making its movement rather clunky and rudimentary, albeit purposeful in stride.

At the core of its facial features rests a single, bright green cyclopean orb, which serves as its visual apparatus, granting the entity enhanced vision for scanning and observing the fine details of the surrounding environment. This, paired with a set of mundane spectacles, allows the entity to amplify its perceived reality and pick out even the most minute irregularities.

The Traffic Warden possesses a set of quasi-human teeth, concealed behind its facial coverings. Unlike most synthetic entities, however, this feature perpetually bears a frightened expression, as if the entity is constantly feeling threatened or concerned about its surroundings.

As expected of its job title, the entity carries a silver chain trinket, which has been observed to possess various anomalous properties capable of controlling and manipulating vehicular movement.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-6735 is a rather impulsive entity that tends to act before thinking things through clearly. This reckless behavior brings forth numerous humorous situations, such as clumsily causing minor accidents or mishaps in attempts to impress or exhibit its capabilities to colleagues or peers.

Nevertheless, under careful observation, the entity seems to possess a unique level of adaptability and resourcefulness that compensates for its shortcomings, making it an invaluable asset to the foundation's Bureau of Traffic Control.
