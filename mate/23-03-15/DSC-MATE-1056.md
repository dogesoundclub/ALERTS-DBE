ID # : DSC-MATE-1056
DSC-MATE-1056, known by their code name "The Banker," is a seemingly ordinary human male with striking orange stripes adorning his face. However, the most unnerving feature of DSC-MATE-1056 is their eyes, which have been described as red clown eyes that seem to pierce through even the toughest of barriers.

Despite their mundane job as a banker, DSC-MATE-1056 tends to be very introspective and may spend a lot of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

Most notably, DSC-MATE-1056 is often seen wearing a red beanie and a silver chain, which appear to be their signature accessories. They are also frequently seen holding a cigarette, which doesn't seem to be extinguished no matter how long it's been lit.

Initial observations suggest that DSC-MATE-1056 may possess latent psychic abilities or even be under the influence of some type of magical enchantment. As such, they are currently being monitored and evaluated by the DogeSoundClub's Containment and Research teams to determine the extent of their abilities and potential risks to public safety.
