ID # : DSC-MATE-1675
DSC-MATE-1675, also known as "The Feline Scribe", is a sentient tiger with a penchant for the creative arts. He possesses a pair of eerie red clown eyes that seem to pierce straight through his subjects, enhancing the aura of mystery he exudes. His forehead bears a striking two-color band, giving him an air of a martial artist, or perhaps a member of a secret society.

He dons a doge hat atop his feline head; an oddly appropriate accessory for his playful nature. The enigmatic feline reporter is often observed sporting a medical mask over his snout, possibly as a nod to the current pandemic or as a display of his own unusual style.

Perhaps one of The Feline Scribe's most notable features is his silver chain adorned around his neck, which may be a testament to his status as a feared member of the urban jungle or simply a fashion choice by this whimsical creature.

Despite his intimidating appearance, DSC-MATE-1675 is renowned for his expressive and imaginative personality. His creativity often manifests itself through his unusual hobbies, such as cosplay, writing poetry or creating fascinating art pieces. Some have even referred to him as an eccentric collector of exotic artifacts.

We advise all personnel to exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-1675, as he is known to have a mischievous and unpredictable streak. However, his talents as a reporter will undoubtedly prove valuable in our ongoing efforts to document and understand the supernatural world.
