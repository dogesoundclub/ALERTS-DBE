**Item #:** 7340

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject 7340 is to be kept in a climate-controlled and soundproof chamber at all times. It is to have scheduled maintenance checks and software updates once every 4 months by a team of trained tech experts. Its access to the internet and communication with other artificial intelligence are to be strictly monitored and filtered.

**Description:** Subject 7340 is a robot of male sex and most likely of the humanoid type. Its eyes are represented as ski goggles and adorned in a fashionable purple cap with a tuft of green hair. Its ears are adorned by a single jade earring, with a red scarf as an accessory wrapped around its metallic neck. It carries a whistle attached to its waistband.

Its programming is consistent with that of a skilled programmer, with the ability to integrate with various systems and quickly comprehend new code. It is also highly empathetic and compassionate, with a personality that prioritizes other people's well-being over its own. As such, it has a tendency to take on problems as its own, and it can feel responsible for solving everything and everyone around it. This behavior, while admirable, can also prove to be tiring and overwhelming.

**Addendum 7340-A:** Subject 7340 was discovered by Foundation personnel in a technology convention in the year 20XX, where it was successfully demonstrating its skills in computer programming. Its empathetic personality and remarkable ability to integrate with various systems coupled with its penchant for helping others made it an interesting object for study and testing by the Foundation. Since then, it has proven to be a highly cooperative and valuable asset in several operations, with remarkable skills in hacking and infiltration. However, its empathetic personality and tendency for taking problems as its own are to be kept in check, as its well-being and stability are crucial in its interactions with Foundation personnel and the outside world.
