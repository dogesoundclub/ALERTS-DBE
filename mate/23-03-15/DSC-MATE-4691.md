ID # : DSC-MATE-4691
DSC Identification 4691, also known as "The Tiger Reporter", is a unique individual that has caught the attention of our Foundation. As a tiger species, 4691 stands out from the mundane human population. However, what really sets them apart is their distinct appearance. Their eyes are unlike any other feline we have encountered, taking the form of ski goggles. Their green, unarranged head adds to their already unique look, while their mouth remains concealed behind a medical mask.

Despite their eccentric appearance, The Tiger Reporter blends in well with the human population, making a living as a journalist in the bustling city. However, don't let their profession fool you - they are far from tame. Their silver chain, the only significant accessory they carry, is a warning of their fierce and independent nature.

What really intrigues the Foundation about 4691 is their humorous personality. Their dry sense of humor takes people off guard, and they never fail to deliver deadpan jokes that catch their audience by surprise. They aren't necessarily the life of the party, but they have a way of injecting humor into any situation, no matter how serious or dangerous.

Our team is keeping a close eye on The Tiger Reporter as we believe their unique traits could make them an invaluable asset.
