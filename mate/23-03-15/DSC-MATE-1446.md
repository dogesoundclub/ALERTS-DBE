Description:
Subject 1446, codenamed "The Train Driver", is a male monkey of indeterminate species, with a striking appearance. The subject's head is adorned with bright green hair, currently somewhat unkempt, with a purple cap perched atop it. The subject's eyes are obscured by a pair of nerd glasses, adding to the creature's somewhat comical appearance. 

Subject 1446's outfit is completed with a red scarf around its neck, lending a certain sartorial derring-do to its ensemble. At times, the subject may also be observed possessing a cigarette, which it will often hold in a manner that suggests it has no idea how to actually smoke.

Personality-wise, The Train Driver is a jolly sort of fellow, with a great sense of humor. The subject delights in making others laugh, and is fond of telling humorous stories or performing silly impersonations to lighten the mood, even in the most dire of circumstances. 

The Train Driver currently holds a position as a locomotive operator, and has been observed to excel at its job, despite its somewhat unconventional nature. However, as with all anomalous creatures, extreme caution is advised when dealing with The Train Driver - while it may be a jester at heart, it is not to be underestimated.
