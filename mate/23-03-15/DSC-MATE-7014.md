Subject 7014 is a human news anchor, often seen on television screens reporting on important events happening in the city. However, don't let the professional demeanor and charming smile fool you, as there's more to him than meets the eye.

Adorned with a bucket hat and a green cross earring on one side, subject 7014's most striking features are the spots on his face that seem to shift and change in shape. It is unknown if they truly are spots or if they are some form of markings.

Behind them, one can see his dark eyes that are often hidden behind a pair of normal glasses. He is fond of wearing a medical mask that covers the lower half of his face, which adds a degree of mysteriousness to his appearance.

Another unique accessory that he sports is a bright red scarf that seems to be ever-present around his neck, no matter the occasion.

Subject 7014 has an independent streak that borders on stubbornness. He prides himself on being self-reliant and often takes on tasks beyond his capacity. It's not uncommon to see him struggling to move furniture or navigate the city without a map, despite being lost.

To what extent this behavior is willful or caused by an unexplained force is yet to be determined. Proceed with caution when encountering subject 7014, as there may be more to his story than meets the eye.
