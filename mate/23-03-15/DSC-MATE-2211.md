Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 

Subject 2211 must be kept in a secure facility with reinforced titanium walls and biometric scanners at each point of entry. The enclosure must be maintained at a constant temperature of 25 degrees Celsius to ensure the comfort of the Tiger. Personnel entering the enclosure must wear protective gear to avoid any potential danger. The subject is to be fed a daily diet of fresh meat and monitored for any signs of aggression or abnormal behaviour. 

Description:

Subject 2211 appears to be a male Bengal Tiger, equipped with ski goggle eyes, a police cap head, and jade earring ears. The Tiger's mouth is concealed beneath a medical mask preventing any possibility of vocal communication. The Tiger exhibits traits of a Farmer, and his behavior is marked by curiosity and fondness for objects associated with farming.

One of the most significant aspects of this creature is its deep-rooted empathy and understanding of others. The Tiger expresses concern for those who undergo any physical or emotional pain and suffering. This creature's observations are usually followed by intense emotional responses, including tears and uncontrollable outbursts.

It is recommended that any facility containing subject 2211 has ample space for the creature to roam and rest, as well as an outdoor environment, resembling a natural habitat. The Tiger's well-being is tied to its connection with nature, and this is particularly evident in its fondness for animals.

This creature is deemed safe for observation and any form of interaction. However, due to the potential inherent dangers associated with its animalistic traits, extreme caution must be taken when in its presence, and contact shall be restricted to only authorized personnel. 

Additional Notes:

Subject 2211's existence is still subject to approval. Any unexpected actions or traits expressed by the creature must be immediately reported to the concerned authority. The Tiger's legendary empathy, sensitivity, and understanding of other creatures' emotions make it a remarkable specimen for observation and study, particularly in the realms of animal psychology and neurobiology.
