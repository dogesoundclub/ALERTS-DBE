ID # : DSC-MATE-1931
DSC-MATE-1931 is a male primate of the species Monkey, with a distinct feature - a frightened expression around the mouth. The subject's head shows normal black hair, and a jade earring is a prominent feature around the ears.

DSC-MATE-1931 is a firefighter, tasked with the protection of civilians and containment of anomalous fires. However, it is noteworthy that despite being a Monkey, DSC-MATE-1931 has demonstrated a strong sense of intuition that is almost supernatural in nature.

They have the ability to sense emotions and predict future events, making them eerily accurate and impressive in their predictions. This has led to speculation of psychic abilities and has marked DSC-MATE-1931 as an anomalous entity that requires further study.

Researchers have observed that DSC-MATE-1931's intuition appears to be tied to their empathy and understanding of human emotions, which they seem to be more attuned to than their primate counterparts.

Therefore, the Foundation has classified DSC-MATE-1931 as a Euclid-level anomaly, requiring specialized containment and further analysis to understand the extent of their abilities and any potential risks associated with them.
