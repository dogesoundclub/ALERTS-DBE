Item #: 3525

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 3525 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Access to Subject 3525 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or above, and interaction is to be limited to scheduled interviews or medical checkups.

Personnel interacting with Subject 3525 must wear surgical masks at all times, due to his profession as a veterinarian and potential infectious diseases. Any objects given to Subject 3525 must be checked for any anomalous properties before being granted.

Description:

Subject 3525 is a human male, standing at 6’2” and weighing approximately 180 lbs. He possesses several distinctive facial features, including spots that cover his skin, a undeniably clown-like mouth, and deep blue clown eyes. A red victory band encircles his forehead while a green cross earring dangles from each earlobe.

Subject 3525 is a fully licensed veterinarian and displays expertise in animal care and treatment, primarily in the field of avian genetics. However, Subject 3525 appears to have a morbid sense of humor, often pointing out the irony of animal-related deaths or lamenting about how their corpses would make excellent specimens for his research. 

Despite the specimen's hostile nature, they tend to be very analytical and logical, displaying a dry, deadpan delivery to his jokes.

Addendum 3525-A: Interviews with Subject 3525 have yielded little information regarding any anomalous properties. However, they appear to have an unnaturally keen ability to diagnose and cure ailments. In one instance, Subject 3525 single-handedly neutralized a deadly avian virus that threatened to destroy an entire chicken farm. Further testing is necessary to determine the full extent of their anomalous capability.
