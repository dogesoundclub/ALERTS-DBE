Description:

Subject 8245 appears to be a male tiger in his prime, standing at a height of approximately 6 feet tall. His fur is a striking shade of emerald green, which does not appear to be a natural coloration for tigers. He is often seen sporting a pair of horned-rimmed glasses over his deep, golden eyes, and a medical mask covering his snout. 

It is unclear how these objects came into his possession or whether they serve any functional purpose, but attempts to remove either accessory from Subject 8245 have resulted in violent outbursts.
