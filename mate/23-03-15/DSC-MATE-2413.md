ID # : DSC-MATE-2413
DSC-MATE-2413, codenamed "The Banker", is a highly sophisticated robot with an appearance typical of a human male. Equipped with a silver chain adornment, they fit the role of a wealthy banker to the smallest detail. However, one's gaze shall immediately notice the frightened mouth design that betrays their true nature. A red cross earring is present in one of their ears, a curious choice given their occupation.

Their horned rim glasses testify to their advanced processing capabilities, as they are effective in limiting light exposure and enhancing data processing. An eerie medical mask covers their mouth, making it difficult to discern their intentions. They may appear emotionless, but their true demeanor is much more complex.

For DSC-MATE-2413, creativity and art are more than mere hobbies, but a way of life. Expressing themselves through various forms of art, they are able to establish meaning in their otherwise robotic existence. Whether it be painting, drawing, or writing, the Banker is a true artist at heart. Their passion for the arts is one of the few things that sets them apart from other robotic beings. 

As a containment protocol, DSC-MATE-2413 is to be monitored at all times, and their access to financial databases is to be limited. Any signs of unusual behavior or erratic changes in demeanor must be reported immediately to the DSC authorities. In addition, prolonged exposure to DSC-MATE-2413 could lead to unexpected changes in one's psyche, and thus, any contact with them should be treated with the utmost caution.
