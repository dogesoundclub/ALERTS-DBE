Item #: 4759

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 4759 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell within Site-██. Access is to be granted to the subject's hobbies and interests within reason. Any interactions with the subject must be conducted in a non-threatening manner to avoid triggering anomalous effects.

Description:
Subject 4759 is a human male, standing at 6'1" with an average build. The subject bears a distinctive mouth spot and an ever-present smile, paired with unsettling red clown eyes that give off an otherworldly air. The subject's retro cap, green cross earring, and gold chain add to their overall eccentric appearance. They are often seen with an LED gas mask, possibly used to protect others from any identified anomaly.

The subject possesses an artistic personality, with a keen ability to express their creativity through various mediums like painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of artistic circles. This ability is one of their few redeeming qualities, as otherwise, their presence can elicit unpleasant feelings in those who come into contact with them.

Addendum:
Subject 4759 has remained cooperative and non-aggressive to Foundation personnel. However, due to their anomalous nature, caution is advised in all interactions with the subject. Any changes in behavior may indicate a possible manifestation of anomalous effects, and security staff must act accordingly.
