Subject 6407 is a male human with an impressive natural charm and charisma that belies his chosen profession: lawyer. His appearance is quite striking, with his metal purple head and jade earring adding an element of otherworldliness to his human form. And while his normal glasses may seem mundane at first glance, they are in fact integral to his powers - they grant him the ability to see through any illusion or deception.

However, it is his smile that truly sets 6407 apart. It is contagious, drawing in others and putting them at ease. He often carries a candy stick with him, not only as a fun accessory but also as a clever way to disarm his opponents in court.

As friendly and approachable as he may seem, caution is still advised when dealing with 6407. His goggle, worn proudly on his forehead, allows him to see through the veil that separates our world from the supernatural. He is always on the lookout for any misdeeds or monsters that may be lurking under a civilized facade.

Beneath his jovial exterior, 6407 is a tireless advocate for justice and truth. He will stop at nothing to uncover the truth and bring to light any nefarious deeds. While his methods may seem unconventional at times, his intentions are always pure.
