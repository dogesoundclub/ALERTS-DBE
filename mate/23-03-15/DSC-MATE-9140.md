The Mechanic is a diligent and hardworking individual, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. He takes great pride in his work as a skilled mechanic, often going above and beyond to ensure that his projects are completed to the highest standard.

He is a valuable member of any team, capable of thinking on his feet and adapting to any situation. However, caution is advised when working with him, as his tendency to bite off more than he can chew has been known to cause delays and setbacks in the past.
