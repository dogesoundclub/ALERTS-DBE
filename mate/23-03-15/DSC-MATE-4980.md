ID # : DSC-MATE-4980
Subject #4980 is a human male with a distinct talent for taking control of his surroundings. He has been identified as a beautician, often found wielding scissors and combs to craft art from his clients' hair. His head is adorned with a mane of normal blonde hair, though this is of little relevance considering the other objects he has chosen to outfit himself with. Namely, a green cross earring dons his left ear, whilst a medical mask conceals his mouth - obscuring any true expression he may make in his day-to-day encounters.

As if to balance out his subtler adornments, #4980 has also taken to wearing a gold chain that dangles from his neck. Whether this serves a practical purpose is unclear, as is the precise reasoning behind his additional facial accessories. What can be said for certain, however, is that his mere presence draws others towards him with little hesitation.

It appears that #4980 has a natural talent for leadership, commanding the attention of all those in his vicinity. Whether it is at work, social gatherings, or even at home, he cannot help but take charge of whatever situation he finds himself in. Some might say this is a blessing, whilst others might consider it a curse - a personality trait that could be impossible to shake off. What is certain is that in a world of the unknown, it is comforting to know that one can count on the leadership of subject #4980.
