DSC-MATE-8991 is a male human of average height and build, with a distinct mouth spot located on the upper left side of his mouth. His eyes have been permanently altered to resemble ski goggles, and he wears a gold chain around his neck as an accessory. DSC-MATE-8991 also wears a green cross earring on his left ear and is often seen smoking cigarettes.

DSC-MATE-8991's most noticeable feature is his constant smile, which is always present regardless of the situation. Despite his friendly demeanor, DSC-MATE-8991 has been shown to be impulsive and prone to acting on his emotions. This trait can lead to potentially dangerous situations, which is why DSC-MATE-8991 is classed as Euclid.

However, this trait has proven to be problematic when dealing with high-risk situations, and caution is advised when interacting with DSC-MATE-8991.

DSC-MATE-8991 remains a mysterious figure, and as such, further research into his past is warranted to determine any potential threats he may pose to the Foundation and wider society.
