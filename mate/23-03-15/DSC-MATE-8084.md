ID # : DSC-MATE-8084
Item #: 8084

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 8084 is to be kept under constant observation whenever possible. As a non-anomalous human, it is allowed freedom of movement within the designated urban area.

Description:

Subject 8084 appears to be a male human of average height and build, with recognizable orange stripes running horizontally along its facial region. Its face is permanently fixed in a state of fear, with the mouth agape and trembling. The eyes are a reddish, almost glowing hue resembling those of a clown, with an unsettling aspect that makes prolonged eye contact uncomfortable.

Subject 8084 is characterized most strikingly by its head, which is shaved bald in the manner of a monk. It also sports unusual green cross earrings, a silver chain, and a perpetual cigarette dangling from one corner of the mouth, which is considered hazardous in a containment context.

Despite its alarming appearance, Subject 8084 has displayed a deep curiosity about the world around it, often seeking out obscure or unique facts and trivia to share with others. This can sometimes lead to humorous situations, such as when it rambles on at length about some arcane subject or spurts out random, arcane facts without warning. 

Subject 8084 is known to work as a lawyer, and it is therefore suggested that its knowledge of the law be exploited if it is found necessary. Otherwise, no anomalous properties have been detected in Subject 8084, and the public should not be alerted to its presence. 

Stay vigilant.
