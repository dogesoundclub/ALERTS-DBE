Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2577 is currently employed at a local bank and is to be monitored closely. Any attempts to use his position within the bank for illegal purposes must be reported immediately to the Foundation.

Description:

Subject 2577 is a human male with a distinctive Mohawk hairstyle. He is often seen wearing a bright red scarf and a standard gas mask. The subject appears to have a love for adventure and often takes risks to spice up his otherwise mundane life. This can create dangerous situations, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

Subject 2577 is aware of the existence of the supernatural and has shown an interest in learning more about it. However, his reckless behavior has proven to be a liability when dealing with paranormal entities. His fascination with adventure may lead him to seek out danger, which makes containing him a top priority.

Addendum:

It has been observed that Subject 2577 may possess some level of awareness of the Foundation's activities. Extreme caution must be exercised when interacting with him, and measures must be taken to ensure he remains unaware of our presence. Any attempts to recruit him as a field agent must be reviewed by Level 4 personnel.
