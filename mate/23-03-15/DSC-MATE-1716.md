ID # : DSC-MATE-1716
DSC-MATE-1716, designated as "The Traffic Officer", is a robotic being with a startling green Cyclops eye as its primary facial feature. Its mouth often appears to be in a state of fear, inexplicably frozen in a state of wide-eyed fright. Its unsettling appearance is further compounded by the presence of ski goggles in place of normal eyes, and a bucket hat and red cross earring adorning its head and ears, respectively. 

In addition, the Traffic Officer often sports a gold chain accessory around its neck, adding a level of bling to its overall appearance. Despite its peculiar look, however, DSC-MATE-1716 is an adept traffic officer, dutifully keeping the roads safe and clear of obstacles whenever possible. 

Despite his devotion to his job, DSC-MATE-1716 is also known to be quite impulsive and spontaneous. His tendency to take risks on a whim can lead to entertaining stunts, such as jumping off a cliff into a nearby lake or river without hesitation. Despite his eccentric behavior, DSC-MATE-1716 is a valuable asset to the Foundation and a testament to its ongoing dedication to the safety and well-being of all who reside within its jurisdiction.
