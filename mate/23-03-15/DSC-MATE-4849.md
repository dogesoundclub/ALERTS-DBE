Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4849 is to be monitored at all times while on the premises of any fast-food establishment. Personnel are advised to avoid consuming products prepared and served by 4849, as it is possible that they may have tampered with the food. Any suspicious behavior is to be documented immediately and reported to the appropriate authorities.

Description:

Subject 4849 is a male human with a distinctive mouth spot and a look of perpetual fear etched into his face. He wears geeky-looking glasses and has a pair of goggles perched on his forehead. A gold earring dangles from his left ear, and he sports a gold chain around his neck. He is often observed smoking a cigarette, despite workplace rules and regulations.

While subject 4849 comes across as timid and unassuming, there is evidence to suggest that he possesses a heightened sense of empathy and compassion. He often goes out of his way to help others and takes their problems upon himself. Unfortunately, his altruism can lead to him becoming easily overwhelmed and exhausted.

Subject 4849's appearance and mannerisms make him appear non-threatening, but do not be fooled by this fa√ßade. He is clever and devious and is suspected of being involved in a number of criminal activities. It is unknown whether his desire to please and help others is genuine, or if it is a ruse designed to gain his victims' trust.

Overall, while subject 4849 appears harmless, he should be approached with caution. His tendency to become excessively involved in the lives of others makes him unpredictable and potentially volatile.
