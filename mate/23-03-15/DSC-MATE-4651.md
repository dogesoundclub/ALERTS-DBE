Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-4651 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-4651 is to be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher. DSC-MATE-4651 is to be provided with appropriate access to entertainment and literature materials.

Description:
DSC-MATE-4651 is a human male, approximately 28 years old with orange stripes on his face. His eyes are VR Rainbow LED, and he wears a jade earring. Additionally, DSC-MATE-4651 is always seen wearing a red scarf and carries a candy stick.

DSC-MATE-4651 possesses high analytical and logical skills, often making him out to be an essential asset in the field where informed decisions are the key. Despite his serious and focused demeanor, he is known to crack humorous wits dryly and in a deadpan way, which is said to be a part of his quirky personality.

DSC-MATE-4651 came into the Foundation's attention when rumors were spread about a person who could predict the content of movies released in the theater weeks before their actual release. DSC-MATE-4651 admits that he can do this because he has built a predictive model that factors in the demographics, potential trends, and its impacts that could affect the film's reception.

DSC-MATE-4651 cooperated with the Foundation, and his cooperation has aided in the prevention of possible breaches that could arise from the malinterpretation of the predictive model he uses. DSC-MATE-4651 has been allowed to use some of his predictive models to predict certain anomalies, indirectly helping other DSC teams.

DSC-MATE-4651 also holds a keen interest in fine arts and is currently working as a theater manager for a local theater company. Due to the knack for his work, he has been granted access to the Foundation's art collections with the condition to maintain a covert exhibition to other personnel.

Addendum:
During a routine inspection of DSC-MATE-4651's chamber, a document outlining a set of algorithms was recovered, which detailed the probability of the existence of alternate timelines. Whether or not these algorithms are valid is yet to be determined. Further investigation into the matter is underway.
