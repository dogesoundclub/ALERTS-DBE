ID # : DSC-MATE-5613
DSC-MATE-5613, also known as "The Hooded Monkey", is a sentient primate of unknown origin. This species of monkey exhibits unique characteristics unlike any previously encountered, including a penchant for wearing hoodies and ski goggles over their bright, expressive eyes. 

While employed as a fast food worker, DSC-MATE-5613 is very social and thrives in environments where they can interact with others. Typically, they are often found carrying a candy stick, which they use as a comfort item when stressed. 

Despite their small stature, DSC-MATE-5613 possesses an innate ability to be extremely nurturing and protective of any and all objects they perceive as "alive". DSC-MATE-5613 will often rename inanimate objects as they are able to form strong bonds with them, treating them with the same caring and compassion that they bestow upon sentient beings. 

Extreme care must be taken when handling DSC-MATE-5613 as they have been observed to take great offense at any perceived mistreatment of anything they consider to be under their protection. While their nurturing personality may appear to be endearing, their level of attachment to non-living objects can be cause for concern. 

Further study will need to be completed to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-5613's unique abilities and tendencies. Until then, all interactions with DSC-MATE-5613 should be carried out with caution and under close supervision.
