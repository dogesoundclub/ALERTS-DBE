Subject 9150 is a human police officer with a striking appearance. Her face is adorned with spots, a feature that sets her apart from the common human population. Her eyes are nothing less than a marvel of technology, fitted with VR rainbow LED, impervious to the damage that could be inflicted on regular eyes. Her head is topped with 90s brown hair, reminiscent of a bygone era.

The subject's forehead features a goggle-like object, perhaps used for enhanced vision, although its function remains unknown. Another unique characteristic this officer possesses is a red cross earring on her ears.

But her physical attributes are only the beginning of her peculiarities. Her personality is characterized by an almost excessive focus on details that can be seen in her daily routines. From the color-coded wardrobe to the alphabetical order of her spice rack, this behavior hints at a more profound mental state, which is yet to be explored.

Subject 9150 is a fascinatingly complex individual, and her unique features and personality make her an invaluable asset in the field. Her incredible attention to detail and astounding focus make her an asset to the police department, and the Foundation will continue to observe her with great interest.
