Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 756 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, monitored at all times by at least one armed guard. No jewelry or items are to be allowed in the cell that are not approved by the Site Director, as subject 756 has displayed a fascination with collecting unique objects.

Description:

Subject 756 is a middle-aged female human, with orange stripes on their face and red lips. Their orange eyebrows and Cross earrings are red in color. Their unkempt green hair makes them easy to identify. They typically wear a silver chain necklace and an LED gas mask. Subject 756 displays a highly imaginative and creative personality, often engaging in unusual hobbies and interests such as writing poetry, creating cosplay costumes or collecting unique objects. Though they are cooperative with Foundation personnel, Subject 756 has been known to display unusually erratic or unpredictable behavior at times, and should be approached with caution.

Addendum:

Subject 756 was discovered after reports were filed from their rural farming community, concerning bizarre behavior and unusual displays around their farm. Upon investigation, the Foundation was alerted to Subject 756, prompting containment procedures to be put in place. While no anomalous properties have yet been discovered, the nature of subject 756's personality and habits, along with the oddities around her farm, dictate cautious containment procedures.
