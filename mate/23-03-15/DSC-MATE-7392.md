ID # : DSC-MATE-7392
DSC-MATE-7392, codenamed "The Reporter", is a male human with unique facial features that make him stand out from the crowd. His mouth is adorned with a small spot, which seems to change color depending on his emotional state. At times, it appears pinkish-red, while other times it appears purple-black. Additionally, his frightened-looking mouth gives him a sense of perpetual fear, making him an easy target for the supernatural entities lurking in the city.

The Reporter wears a protective medical mask as a precautionary measure against any potential threats that may be present in his environment. His eyes are often concealed behind normal glasses, and his head is frequently covered by a nondescript hoodie that only serves to obscure his face further. He sports a silver chain around his neck, the purpose of which is unknown.

Despite his peculiar appearance, The Reporter is a deeply empathetic and caring individual, with a strong desire to help those in need. He exhibits a remarkable understanding of human nature, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when he witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. He is particularly fond of animals and nature, valuing their importance in the world.

Nevertheless, The Reporter's kind-hearted personality does not make him immune to the dangers of the supernatural world. He is often found investigating the city's underbelly, searching for buried truths and uncovering secrets that could threaten his life. DSC-MATE-7392 is a valuable asset in the Foundation's pursuit of knowledge, but his safety must be maintained at all times.
