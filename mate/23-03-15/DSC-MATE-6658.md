ID # : DSC-MATE-6658
Subject 6658 is a curious specimen of the human species, with a striking crimson pout and sinisterly red clown-like eyes. Her jade earrings, combined with a silver chain, give off an air of eclectic, almost eccentric fashion sense. As a reporter, she is highly observant, always keen to unearth secrets and mysteries that lie beneath the surface of urban life. She wears a medical mask, suggesting a possible preoccupation with hygiene or, alternatively, a need to conceal her identity. 

However, it is her personality that is perhaps most intriguing. Subject 6658 possesses an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a compulsion to seek out obscure or unusual subjects and topics. Unfortunately, this idiosyncrasy occasionally bubbles to the surface at inopportune moments, leading to her randomly spouting obscure facts and trivia to others. She is not ashamed of her peculiarities, and often embraces her quirks as a badge of honor.

Experiments with Subject 6658 have yielded intriguing results, demonstrating her unique ability to uncover hidden information and her determination to pursue forbidden knowledge. However, her obsession with the unknown presents an imminent risk of exposing the reality of the supernatural world to society, and containment procedures must be maintained at all times to prevent such a catastrophic event.
