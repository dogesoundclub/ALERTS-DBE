ID # : DSC-MATE-433
Item #433 is to be approached with extreme caution. This villainous primate is a master of deception, able to charm his way into even the most fortified of strongholds. Witnesses describe him as possessing an almost supernatural charismatic quality, allowing him to connect with others at a visceral level.

Despite his charming demeanor, this monkey is not to be underestimated. A master manipulator, he has a reputation for carrying out heinous acts of violence on those who cross him. His thirst for power and control is bolstered by his love for shiny objects, particularly the gold chain he wears around his neck.

It is advised to never engage in direct contact with item #433 without proper protective gear and backup. He has been known to use his charm as a distraction while launching surprise attacks on unsuspecting prey. Use caution when approaching and always be prepared for the unexpected.
