ID # : DSC-MATE-8340
DSC Identification Number 8340 - the Monkey Farmer - is a truly unique specimen. With his striking LED-headset and a unmistakable two-color band on his forehead, he is hard to miss. His eyes, however, remain unknown.

But do not let his seemingly humorous appearance deceive you, for 8340 can be quite impulsive and emotional. Some say it's a trait of his species, but regardless, it has led to some amusing encounters. He has been known to make unexpected decisions that can leave those around him either laughing or bewildered.

Perhaps it's the silver chain dangling from his neck, or the cigarette that's always in his hand that add to his overall nonchalant demeanor. But one thing is for sure, the Monkey Farmer is not to be underestimated. So approach with caution, or you may find yourself caught in one of his whimsical antics.
