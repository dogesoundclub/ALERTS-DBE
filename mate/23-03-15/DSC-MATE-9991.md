ID # : DSC-MATE-9991
Item #: 9991

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 9991 is to be kept under observation at all times, preferably away from potential fire hazards. Due to its occupation as a firefighter, Subject 9991 must be monitored for any reckless behavior that may cause harm to itself or others. The use of sedatives and restraints is authorized if deemed necessary. Interactions with non-Foundation personnel are strictly prohibited.

Description:
Subject 9991 is a male human with distinct physical anomalies that deviate from normal human anatomy. Its face features orange stripes and a clown mouth, with red clown-like eyes. In addition, Subject 9991 has a two-color band on the forehead and wears a green cross earring. Subject 9991 also has a gold chain which it wears around its neck as an accessory. Despite its strange appearance, Subject 9991 is capable of coherent communication and possesses human-level intelligence.

Personality-wise, Subject 9991 is impulsive and prone to acting before thinking, often resulting in peculiar mishaps and accidents. Its desire to show off and impress others could be perceived as narcissistic behavior. Despite its recklessness, Subject 9991 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and is willing to follow orders.

Addendum:
Subject 9991's erratic behavior was brought to the Foundation's attention when it inadvertently caused a minor fire. Initial evaluation deemed it a potential anomalous object due to its unusual appearance, but subsequent research revealed it to be a human with distinct physical mutations. Subject 9991's anomalous abilities, if any, are currently unknown. Further testing is required to determine the extent of its anomalous properties.
