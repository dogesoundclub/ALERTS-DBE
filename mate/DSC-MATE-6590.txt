Designation: SCP-6590

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6590 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with access to basic amenities such as a bed, toilet and shower. Any attempts at exploration beyond this are to be strictly prohibited. Communication with SCP-6590 is to be carried out through a speaker system only.

Description: SCP-6590 is a male human, standing at approximately 175 cm tall and weighing 90 kg. SCP-6590's most distinguishing feature is the presence of multiple spots on their face, with a permanent clown mouth on their face, which is composed of an unknown material. SCP-6590 has bloodshot red eyes with the appearance of clown makeup.

SCP-6590 is usually seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, decorated with a jade earring. They also wear a red scarf and carry a candy stick. SCP-6590's personality is described as being highly social, with a strong sense of maintaining harmony among individuals. They are also known for their inclination towards humour and playfulness, which can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous situations.

SCP-6590 has demonstrated the ability to perform anomalous feats. The use of their candy stick somehow produces a highly addictive substance, causing individuals to maintain loyalty to SCP-6590 even in highly improbable situations. The spot on SCP-6590's face is highly resistant to damage and cannot be removed through conventional means.

SCP-6590 has also been known to communicate telepathically, with limited telekinetic abilities. They appear to have an immense knowledge of the workings of the fast-food industry, which has made them highly sought after by members of various SCP organizations.

SCP-6590's presence poses a significant danger to the Foundation and should be approached with extreme caution. Any interaction with SCP-6590 should be monitored and conducted with authorized personnel present.
