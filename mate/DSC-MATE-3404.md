Item #: DSC-MATE-3404

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3404 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-3404 due to the object’s anomalous properties. Any instances of DSC-MATE-3404-A are to be contained, amnesticized, and released into the wild.

Description: DSC-MATE-3404 is a male rabbit of an unknown subspecies. DSC-MATE-3404 possesses blue clown-like eyes and is observed to wear a retro cap with a gold earring attached to each ear. DSC-MATE-3404 also wears a silver chain and a normal gas mask, which are reported to help contain the object’s anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-3404 displays a unique ability, recently designated DSC-MATE-3404-A. When DSC-MATE-3404 is tasked with organizing a group project, it will effectively delegate tasks to its or any unoccupied DSC-MATE-3404-A, creating an efficient and near-perfect working environment. DSC-MATE-3404-A instances are visually identical to DSC-MATE-3404, but lack the object’s anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-3404’s personality is characterized as being very organized and efficient. DSC-MATE-3404 displays an overbearing nature, and as such, tends to come across as a controlling individual. Despite DSC-MATE-3404’s proclivity towards over-organizing, humorous situations result when DSC-MATE-3404 impromptu delegates tasks in a seemingly matter-of-fact way.

Addendum: The Foundation was alerted to DSC-MATE-3404’s anomalous properties when a local beautician operating a beauty parlor in ████, was reported to the police by concerned customers for controlling and micromanaging everyone in his shop. Further investigation by the Foundation revealed the proprietor to be DSC-MATE-3404. The owner was apprehended and taken to Foundation custody, where the object’s abilities were contained.
