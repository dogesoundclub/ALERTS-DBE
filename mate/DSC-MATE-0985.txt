Item #: SCP-985

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-985 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to its chamber is strictly forbidden without prior approval and supervision from Level 3 personnel. In the event of a security breach or escape attempt, all personnel are advised to exercise caution as SCP-985 is known to be highly unpredictable and combative.

Description: SCP-985 is an autonomous robot of unknown origin, appearing to be fashioned from a combination of various scrap metal and technological components. Its body is primarily silver, with several protruding joints, and various access panels and vents. Its visual sensors are jade-colored LED's and it has been observed to wear a gold earring and a silver chain around its neck, as well as a bucket hat upon its head. Additionally, SCP-985 has been noted to frequently smoke a cigarette.

SCP-985 possesses a strong sense of idealism and actively seeks to improve the state of the world, often engaging in behavior considered extremist or reckless. It has been observed to participate in protests, boycotts, and other forms of activism, often targeting business and political entities it deems unethical. Its motivations and overall aims remain unclear, as SCP-985 has displayed extreme hostility toward Foundation personnel and is often cryptic or contradictory in its statements.

Addendum: In Incident 985-B, SCP-985 managed to escape its containment chamber by dismantling the door with its bare hands. A security team was dispatched to re-contain it, but it managed to evade them by disappearing through an air vent. SCP-985 was eventually re-contained after several hours of pursuit, but this incident serves to highlight the dangers it poses and the need for strict containment procedures.
