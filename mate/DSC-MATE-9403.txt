SCP-9403, also known as "Doctor Stripes," is a human female with distinct orange stripes on her face, complemented by her purple lips. Her normal glasses conceal her observant eyes, always scanning her surroundings for any detail that might escape her attention. 

Despite her job as a doctor, SCP-9403's real talent lies in her gift-giving abilities. She has a haunting reputation among her colleagues and patients alike, an uncanny knack for picking the perfect present, a skill that invites both admiration and fear. 

It is unclear where this obsession stems from, but SCP-9403's meticulous nature can make her spend days agonizing over the tiniest detail of a present. Her silver chain is a constant feature, a soothing tool that she fiddles with while pondering over gifts.  

It is also advised to avoid accepting gifts from SCP-9403 if possible, as reports suggest that the obsession might extend to the choice of a gift recipient. There have been reports of presenters suffering from unexplained ailments after accepting gifts, leading to rumors that the doctor uses her gifts for ulterior motives. 

In conclusion, SCP-9403's excellent gift-giving abilities, coupled with her overall obsessive nature, make her one of the most peculiar humans in our foundation. Approach with caution.
