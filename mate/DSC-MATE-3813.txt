SCP-3813, also known as "Spots", is a security guard in the urban fantasy world. Despite their unusual appearance, Spots is a human with purplish lips and large blue clown eyes. They have unique features like a 2 color band on their forehead, spots on their face, gold earrings, and a silver chain. Spots wears a regular gas mask to blend in with the common people.

Don't mistake their laid-back and nonchalant demeanor for aloofness, as Spots is fiercely protective of their family and friends. Any insult towards their loved ones results in an intense argument, even if it means risking their job. Being a security guard, Spots is vigilant, but their sense of humor doesn't let them take things too seriously. 

Beware, anyone who underestimates Spots, may find themselves in an unexpected and humorous situation. SCP-3813 has both a playful and protective nature, making them a loved and respected member of the urban fantasy world.
