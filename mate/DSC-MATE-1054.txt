Subject 1054 is a notorious figure in the criminal underworld, known only by the nickname "The Don". As the boss of one of the biggest mafia families in the city, he commands respect and fear in equal measure. But don't be fooled by his friendly demeanor and infectious smile - this man is as deadly as he is charming.

Subject 1054's most distinctive feature is the spot on his mouth, which seems to be permanently stained red. Some speculate it may be from all the blood he's spilled over the years, but others say it's simply the result of his love for spicy food. Whatever the cause, it only adds to his aura of danger.

Subject 1054's eyes are hidden behind a pair of ski goggles, which he claims are because he's sensitive to bright lights. But those who have seen him in action know that it's really because he doesn't want anyone seeing what he's thinking. His head is often adorned with a doge hat, a nod to his love of internet memes and internet culture.

But perhaps the most unusual accessory on Subject 1054 are his green cross earrings, which he wears as a reminder of his Catholic upbringing. Despite his criminal activities, he still holds some religious beliefs, and often asks for God's forgiveness before he makes a kill.

Subject 1054 is rarely seen without his gold chain and cigarette, which he always smokes down to the filter. He's a man who likes to indulge in his vices, whether it's the thrill of the kill or the taste of a good Cuban cigar. Despite all this, he has a surprisingly upbeat personality - always enthusiastic and energetic, even in the darkest of situations. Some might even say he enjoys getting others excited about things, leading to some comical situations when others don't share his enthusiasm.

Approach with caution - Subject 1054 may seem friendly, but he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
