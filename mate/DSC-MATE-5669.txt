Item #: 5669

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5669 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Due to its shape-shifting nature, any personnel coming into contact with SCP-5669 must undergo a mental and physical evaluation prior to contact. If SCP-5669 breaches containment, the site is to be put on high alert and MTF Upsilon-2 ("Tiger Hunters") is to be deployed for immediate recontainment.

Description: SCP-5669 is a sapient humanoid resembling a tiger. SCP-5669 is capable of shapeshifting into a near-perfect copy of any person or animal within its line of sight. SCP-5669 is also capable of limited regeneration of its own body, healing from injuries that would prove fatal to most organisms, albeit temporally impairing its current form.

SCP-5669 communicates using a range of vocalizations, as well as through the use of electronic devices. SCP-5669's unique characteristic is a set of VR Jade LED eyes installed into its anatomy, permitting it to see directly into augmented reality, and can even connect itself to online networks through this feature.

Though generally sociable, SCP-5669 can be overprotective of its loved ones, often becoming hostile towards anything or anyone who threatens them. As stated in its profile, SCP-5669 possesses a relaxed and sometimes humorous personality that contradicts its fierce fighting spirit.

Addendum 5669.1:
Recovery log: SCP-5669 was discovered after reports of a "talking tiger" were submitted to several online forums. SCP Foundation embedded undercover agents in the local theater district and tracked SCP-5669 down to a real estate agency's office. SCP-5669 was then contained under the guise of relocation.

[BEGIN LOG]

Dr. █████: Good afternoon, SCP-5669. How are you feeling today?

SCP-5669: I'm doing fine. Thank you for asking.

Dr. █████: Could you answer some questions for us?

SCP-5669: Sure. What do you want to know?

Dr. █████: Can you explain how you're able to perform shapeshifting?

SCP-5669: It's just natural for me. I've been doing it for so long that it's almost instinctual.

Dr. █████: Do you have any idea of your origins or how your abilities came to be?

SCP-5669: I'm sorry. I have no memory of that.

Dr. █████: What can you tell us about your personality?

SCP-5669: I'm pretty laid-back, but I can also be quite protective of my friends and family. I won't allow anyone to hurt them.

Dr. █████: You wear a lot of accessories such as a doge hat, red cross earring, medical mask, and red scarf. Are there any reasons or significance to any of them?

SCP-5669: Ah! This hat and scarf are just fashion statements while this earring and mask are part of a personal symbol for me.

Dr. █████: Thank you, SCP-5669. That will be all.
