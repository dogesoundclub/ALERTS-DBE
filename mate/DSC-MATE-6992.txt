Item #: SCP-6992

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6992 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Under no circumstances is SCP-6992 to be allowed outside of Site-██. Any requests for outside activity must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-6992 appears to be a monkey of the genus Cebus, with a frightened expression permanently fixed on its face. SCP-6992 often exhibits behavior similar to that of a human, including the ability to communicate through sign language, the use of tools, and the ability to reason and plan.

SCP-6992's head is partially pink, likely due to a genetic mutation. Its ears appear to have been pierced and wear a gold earring in its right ear. It also wears a gold chain around its neck at all times. SCP-6992 is often seen wearing a normal gas mask, though the reason for this is currently unknown.

SCP-6992's personality is where it deviates significantly from others of its species. It exhibits deep empathy and understanding for others, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. SCP-6992 also has a fondness for animals and nature, often incorporating elements of both into its artwork.

Addendum: SCP-6992 was initially discovered working as a delivery driver in [REDACTED]. Foundation personnel intercepted the delivery package that SCP-6992 was transporting and brought it back to Site-██ for containment. Due to SCP-6992's anomalous nature, it is believed that it was likely being used for some sort of anomalous activity by the original owner. Further investigation is ongoing.
