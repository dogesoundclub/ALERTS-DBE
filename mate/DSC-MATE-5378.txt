SCP-5378 is a traffic officer of anomalous nature. This human female predominately stands out due to their distinctive face features, which consist of a multitude of intriguing spots and a radiant, inviting smile. Though SCP-5378 seems ordinary at first, be advised that their headwear is a Rainbow Festival hat, which - according to witness testimonies - exudes an inexplicable aura that unsettles onlookers. 

SCP-5378's eyes are obscured by normal glasses. The reason for this is currently unknown, but all attempts to remove them have failed. Secure containment around SCP-5378 is essential as they pose a mild risk due to their quirky personality. SCP-5378 is a creature with a tendency to be excessively fixated on the details of any given situation, leading to seemingly random acts of organization or color-coding. These relentless traits can be arbitrarily harmful, sometimes resulting in unintentional anomalies.

Agents must exercise extreme caution while approaching SCP-5378 as they may fixate on a subject and suddenly cause spatial division, negatively impacting the surrounding environment. SCP-5378 may not seem hostile, but their behavior can be unpredictable, requiring constant observation and documentation of their activities. Ensure proper binding restraints and continuous observation in case of any unanticipated nefarious rationales.
