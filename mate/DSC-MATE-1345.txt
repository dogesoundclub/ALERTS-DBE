SCP-1345 is a human male designated as a "beautician". Despite his occupation, SCP-1345 is often considered an oddity amongst civilians and foundation personnel alike, largely due to his distinctive appearance. SCP-1345 bears several unique traits on his face, including spots and a frightened mouth, which may trigger repulsion or unease in some individuals. SCP-1345 uses nerd glasses to obscure his eyes from view, often hiding behind them to avoid making direct eye contact.

SCP-1345 is usually found donning a hoodie, an accessory that provides additional anonymity to his otherwise unconventional appearance. In addition, SCP-1345 is always seen wearing a silver chain around his neck, the significance of which remains unknown.

SCP-1345's personality is characterized by his notable sense of humor. Despite his off-putting appearance, SCP-1345 enjoys making others laugh, often using joke-telling and silly impersonations to lighten the mood. This tendency can lead to humorous situations, as SCP-1345's laughter is infectious and has occasionally caused foundation personnel to break out in laughter during tense moments.

SCP-1345's abilities and anomalous properties, if any, have yet to be documented. Despite his unusual appearance and persona, SCP-1345 remains compliant with foundation protocol, making him a low-priority anomaly at present.
