DSC-MATE-3091, also known as "The Striped Beautician," is a peculiar human with distinct facial features. The most noticeable of which are her orange stripes that line her cheekbones, giving her a unique and exotic appearance. Additionally, her eyes are an unnerving shade of red, resembling that of a clown. 

Her head is adorned with two pig tails, giving her an innocent and youthful look, while her red-cross earrings complement her unconventional style. She often carries a cigarette, her constant companion, which gives off an air of defiance and rebellion. 

Despite her eccentric appearance, DSC-MATE-3091 is known to be a highly analytical and logical individual. She has a quirky sense of humor, often making witty observations or teasing her friends with her dry, deadpan wit. 

However, despite these quirky traits, DSC-MATE-3091 is not to be underestimated. Her beauty treatments possess anomalous properties that have yet to be fully understood. Those who seek her services often find themselves leaving her salon transformed in unexpected ways, possessing newfound abilities or physical changes. 

The Foundation, recognizing the potential danger of these unpredictable effects, has deemed DSC-MATE-3091 a high-risk individual and has taken measures to contain and monitor her activities.
