Item #: SCP-652

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-652 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit outfitted with at least one feeding bowl of organic vegetables per day. SCP-652 may not leave containment without prior approval from Level 3 personnel, and must be escorted at all times by two armed guards.

Description: SCP-652 appears to be a male rabbit standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. It wears a police cap on its head, which is adorned with a two-color band around the forehead, and sports a pair of goggles. SCP-652 has jade earrings on its elongated ears and wears a silver chain around its neck. It is also outfitted with an LED gas mask. The rabbit is a train driver by profession.

SCP-652's nature is generally docile, but it exhibits an intense empathic ability when it is in the vicinity of other living beings. SCP-652 has been seen to be moved to tears or even emotional outbursts when it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. Additionally, it has a fondness for animals and nature. This trait has been exhibited as both a positive and negative attribute depending on the circumstances.

SCP-652's abilities extend beyond mere empathy. Testing has shown that it possesses a strong psychic link with nearby creatures. SCP-652 can communicate telepathically and receive visions from those it forms a connection with.

Addendum 652-1: It has been proposed that SCP-652 be utilized in the Foundation's Telepathic Communication Division. Further tests are recommended to explore the extent and limits of SCP-652's psychic abilities.
