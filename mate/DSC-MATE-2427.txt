Item #: SCP-2427

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2427 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-2427 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Any interactions with SCP-2427 must be conducted through an intermediary, as direct contact with SCP-2427 may cause unintended emotional responses from personnel.

Description: SCP-2427 is a male human politician with orange stripes on his face. His eyes are of the VR Jade LED variety, while his head is adorned with a bucket hat, and his ears feature a jade earring. SCP-2427 constantly wears a medical mask over his mouth, which has been found to be unnecessary due to his lack of any infectious diseases.

SCP-2427's anomalous properties manifest as intense emotional sensitivity. He displays a deep connection to his emotions and may be easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. SCP-2427 also exhibits a strong fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings. Any emotional stimulus, whether positive or negative, can have a profound effect on SCP-2427's mental state and cause unpredictable emotional outbursts.

Attempts at psychological evaluation of SCP-2427 have been difficult as his lack of control over his emotional response makes it difficult for him to maintain a consistent demeanor. It is recommended that all personnel interacting with SCP-2427 use caution in their approach and maintain a neutral and professional tone throughout.

Addendum: Following Incident-2427-A, testing is being conducted to determine the extent of SCP-2427's emotional influence on those around him. All personnel involved with SCP-2427 are advised to maintain strict emotional control at all times.
