Item #: 1347

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1347, identified as a human male, should not be contained in a standard anomalous subject holding cell. Instead, the subject is to be allowed to continue in their current job as a theater manager, keeping tabs on their activities on a regular basis via cameras, audio equipment, and undercover agents. Should there be any indication that the subject is aware of their anomalous properties, they are to be brought in immediately for further testing and possible reclassification.

Description: Subject 1347 presents itself as a male human with unique physical characteristics. The subject's hair is a normal blonde color with orange stripes running through it, a feature that is not supported by any known genetic mutation. The subject has normal glasses as eyes, but with no known enhancement. The forehead of the subject features a pair of goggles, which although not visible abnormality, behaves like anomaly after certain conditions are met. 

Subject 1347's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence, which can sometimes lead to humorous outcomes when it comes to asking for help. The subject will often attempt to complete tasks single-handedly, even when it is significantly difficult or impossible. At times, subject 1347 may display stubbornness, especially when asked to take directions from others or when trying to navigate their way through unfamiliar terrain.

It's important to note the anomalous representations of the goggles on the subject's forehead. The goggles appear to be nothing more than an accessory, designed to fit the subject's aesthetic preference. However, when there's a need for assistance or quick action, the goggles' lenses will create an unknown rippling effect which instantly transports the subject to the location which 1347 has in his mind.

Any further research or attempts to understand the anomaly should be done with caution, due to the subject's unpredictable reactions toward others, which might be affected by the nature of the contents known only to 1347.
