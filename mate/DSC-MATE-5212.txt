Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. #5212 is to be contained within Site-██'s medical wing and is to be monitored by security personnel at all times. Due to her absent-minded nature, all appointments and meetings must be scheduled a minimum of two hours in advance and confirmed by at least two staff members. Dr. #5212 is not to be allowed access to any anomalous objects or information regarding them.

Description: Dr. #5212 is a human female, approximately 5'6" in height and weighing 125 lbs. The most striking aspect of her appearance is the numerous spots that cover her face, arms, and legs. Despite their appearance, these spots do not seem to affect her health in any way. In addition to the spots, Dr. #5212 has red clown eyes that seem to emit an otherworldly glow. Her hair is styled in pigtails, and she often wears a gold chain around her neck.

Dr. #5212's personality is best described as forgetful and absent-minded. She often loses track of time and forgets appointments or meetings. However, when she is focused on a project, she is able to work for hours without distraction. This obsessive behavior can lead her to disregard her own safety or the safety of those around her.

Dr. #5212's medical expertise is vast and varied, ranging from standard medical practices to the study of anomalous physiology. However, her access to anomalous objects and information must be restricted due to her absent-minded nature.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Dr. #5212 was involved in an incident involving SCP-███. Due to her forgetfulness, she failed to properly secure the object within its containment chamber, resulting in a containment breach. Dr. #5212 was subsequently treated for injuries sustained during the incident and placed on indefinite suspension pending review.
