Item #: SCP-3801

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3801 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-3801 must be done remotely through a speaker and camera system due to the nature of their anomalous traits. Any personnel who have come into physical contact with SCP-3801 must undergo a decontamination process immediately.

Description: SCP-3801 is a female human with orange stripes across the right side of their head and purple lips. They possess blue clown eyes and wear a gas mask at all times, along with a pair of goggles that are situated on their forehead. Additionally, SCP-3801 has green cross earrings.

SCP-3801 works as an electrician and has demonstrated an exceptional understanding of electrical devices and wiring, including anomalous ones. However, SCP-3801's anomalous traits manifest when they come into physical contact with non-anomalous electricity. When SCP-3801 comes into contact with a live electrical wire or conduit, an electromagnetic pulse is released from their body, which can cause damage to nearby electrical equipment and even start fires. SCP-3801 has minimal control over this effect, which can trigger accidentally if they become startled, causing considerable risk to themselves and others.

SCP-3801 has a no-nonsense attitude, valuing tradition, and family. They have a playful side and enjoy telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through their family or community. SCP-3801 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and is generally well-behaved, but they have a volatile and unpredictable nature due to their anomalous traits.

Addendum [3801-A]: Following Incident-███, all electrical equipment within SCP-3801's containment cell has been replaced with upgraded surge protection and containment protocols have been revised to mitigate any potential damage that may be caused by SCP-3801's anomalous traits.
