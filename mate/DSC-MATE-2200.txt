SCP-2200 is a male, human programmer with distinct features. His face is marked with numerous spots, contrasting with his ski-goggle eyes, giving him a unique-looking appearance. His head is typically not arranged, with unruly green locks of hair bordering his face. A gold earring in his left ear and a medical mask covering his mouth add to his unusual appearance.

Despite his peculiar look, SCP-2200 is a model employee with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. He is always willing to step up to the plate to ensure that tasks are completed to the best of his ability. However, SCP-2200 isn't all business - he knows how to have fun. He's the guy that gets everyone up on their feet and dancing while singing to their favorite tunes. He's the life of the party, full of excitement and energy that could light up a room.

SCP-2200 also sports a silver chain around his neck, acting as another unique accessory to his appearance. All in all, SCP-2200 may appear to be a peculiar individual, but he is an incredibly driven and fun-loving person who's always committed to his work.
