Item #: 3847

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3847, also known as "The Monkey", must be kept in a specially modified containment chamber equipped with a climbing frame, a variety of toys and potable water sources. Subject 3847 must not be allowed to interact with any humans outside of a supervised, strictly scheduled open campus program.

Description: Subject 3847 is a physically insignificant primate resembling a Rhesus monkey with ski goggles for eyes, a gray hoodie for a head, a red scarf for a necktie and an LED gas mask clasped to his mouth. Despite its outwardly peculiar appearance, subject 3847 is very intelligent and can speak fluently in English as well as sign language.

Behavior-wise, subject 3847 is highly adventurous and enthusiastic about his work as a real estate agent, often signing more contracts than he can handle due to an intense sense of responsibility that compels him to go the extra mile for his clients. He is highly sensitive to stress and often engages in eccentric behaviors like obstacle course workouts, puzzle solving, and stacking cookies all while wearing his gas mask.

Subject 3847 has shown no aggressive tendencies towards staff or visitors; however, it is important to remember that his social skills have been developed in a highly unnatural environment.

Addendum: Subject 3847 has requested access to a "personal assistant" to help him with his task management. This request is still under review, but we believe that providing him with a companion who can keep up with his pace could be beneficial to his wellbeing while also increasing his work output.
