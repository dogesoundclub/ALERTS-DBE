Item #: 5054

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5054 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject's equipment, including his firefighter gear and gas mask, are to be stored in a secure locker adjacent to his cell. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-5054 must be conducted by personnel wearing full protective suits and oxygen masks to prevent potential exposure to DSC-MATE-5054's anomalous abilities.

Description: DSC-MATE-5054 is a human male with unusual facial features. His mouth is marked with a black spot, resembling a birthmark. He also wears a pair of glasses common among intellectuals or bookworms. The subject's head is bald and closely shaven, resembling that of a monk. As a firefighter, DSC-MATE-5054 is well-muscled and trained in various firefighting techniques.

DSC-MATE-5054's anomalous effects manifest when he wears his normal gas mask. When worn, the mask allows DSC-MATE-5054 to generate bursts of flames from his mouth, ranging from small sparks to large blasts of fire. However, these flames are not under the subject's direct control and can erupt spontaneously or in response to elevated emotional states. As a consequence, DSC-MATE-5054 is highly sensitive to stress and must monitor his emotional state in order to prevent potential fire hazards.

DSC-MATE-5054 exhibits a dry and often sarcastic sense of humor, which he demonstrates through his ability to deliver deadpan jokes that frequently catch others off guard. He is not typically outgoing, but can be surprisingly funny when he chooses to be. DSC-MATE-5054 is highly focused on his job as a firefighter, and is often described as brave and dedicated by his fellow colleagues.

Addendum: Due to his anomalous abilities, DSC-MATE-5054 is a valuable asset to the Foundation's firefighting units. However, the potential risks associated with his powers require constant guidance and supervision. Any unauthorized use of DSC-MATE-5054's powers outside of controlled testing conditions is strictly prohibited.
