Item #: 8876

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8876, identified as a human female in her late twenties, is to be monitored by the Foundation as an electrician working for a local power company. Routine checks are to be conducted on her residence and workspace to ensure no anomalous activity occurs.

Description: Subject 8876 stands at 5 feet, 5 inches and possesses a striking feature in her red lips, reminiscent of the classic femme fatale of noir films. Her hairstyle and dress attire point towards the 00s school girl fashion trend, but it is noted that she pairs this with a set of jade earrings and a silver chain necklace.

Personality-wise, subject 8876 showcases an independent streak, often shirking the need for assistance when it is offered. This has led to humorous circumstances, such as her attempting to move heavy machinery alone or refusing the use of a navigation system when lost.

When prompted for information regarding potential magical anomalies, 8876 denies any knowledge or actively obstructs Foundation personnel, claiming such notions are "outlandish" and a waste of resources.

Additional Notes: Subject 8876 may have potential as a thespian, showcasing a flair for drama and occasional theatrical performances at open mic nights. However, further investigation is required.
