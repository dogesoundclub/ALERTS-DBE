Description: SCP-7581 is a human male of average build and height. SCP-7581 is easily identified by his unique appearance as he has a rare mark on his mouth and red clown eyes. SCP-7581 has had his head replaced with metal purple, and he sports a jade earring on his right ear. SCP-7581 wears a silver chain and carries a candy stick with him at all times.

SCP-7581 has a strong and decisive personality, which can come across as bossy or intimidating. However, it's all because they want to make sure things are done efficiently and effectively. SCP-7581 demands discipline and order amongst their team and takes a no-nonsense approach to their work. SCP-7581's influence can improve the performance of their fellow security personnel, possibly due to fear of authority, respect, or a combination of both.

SCP-7581 is a competent and reliable security guard when it comes to handling threats, but they possess no anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-7581 admitted to having a fear of clowns and was willing to undergo counseling to address this fear, but the request was denied due to the non-anomalous nature of the fear.
