Item #: SCP-1361

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1361 is to be contained within a designated political office at all times. Access to SCP-1361 is to be restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any interaction with SCP-1361 must be monitored and recorded.

Description: SCP-1361 is a humanoid entity identified as a female politician. SCP-1361 has orange stripes on the face, a red lip, and wears a bucket hat. The forehead features a 2 color band, along with a gold chain and a cigarette as accessories.

SCP-1361 appears to possess an enhanced emotional state, often being moved to tears by sentimental moments in media or artistic endeavors. SCP-1361's fondness for music and art is an anomaly in comparison to other politicians and may potentially influence their political decision-making process. 

SCP-1361 has not exhibited any anomalous abilities at this time, but their emotional state presents a possible threat to the Foundation's efforts to maintain secrecy and control over anomalous activity within the political arena.

Addendum: Due to SCP-1361's anomalous nature, Foundation personnel are to monitor and record any political decisions made by SCP-1361 and report any anomalies or deviations from expected political behavior.
