DogeSoundClub Description - 3092 "The Excited Farmer"

Item #: DSC-MATE-3092

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3092 should be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The farmer must have access to a farmable garden that contains nutrient-rich crops to sustain their enthusiasm and energy. The chamber has to be soundproof as the subject tends to make loud noises when excited. Food and clothing supplies may be limited as subject has shown no restraint in excessive consumption and fashion acquisition.

Description: DSC-MATE-3092 is a humanoid, female farmer who displays heightened levels of enthusiasm and energy. She expresses her exuberance through excitable body movements, loud vocalizations, and a constantly cheerful demeanor, making her a possible threat to the normalcy of Foundation operations. Despite her condition, 3092 retains full cognitive and analytical abilities.

3092's appearance is notably different from a typical human. Her head is green and features an edge curl. This is complemented by orange stripes on her face and red lip color. The subject's eyes are blue clown eyes, which may distort the vision of observers if stared at for too long. Ears feature gold earrings with matching silver chains. It is unclear if these are biologically formed or self-enhanced.

Personality-wise, 3092 is animated and can emit physical enthusiasm onto others through sheer energy. They have a tendency to become agitated and uncontainable, causing various disruptions and disturbances. They have demonstrated a particular interest in gardening and nature, and often shows pride and excitement in growing plants in their containment cell.
