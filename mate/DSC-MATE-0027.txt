Description: SCP-27 is a male human of average height and build, with an unusual appearance. He has distinctive spots on his face and a permanent smile, which contributes to his playful demeanor. His eyes are red in color and have been surgically altered to resemble those of a clown. SCP-27 consistently wears a pair of goggles on his forehead and a green cross earring in his left ear. He often carries a candy stick as a prop of sorts.

SCP-27 is the current leader of an organized crime syndicate, and has an extensive network of criminal connections. He utilizes this network to smuggle anomalous objects and perform illicit activities. Despite his criminal nature, SCP-27 has a friendly and outgoing personality, often engaging in playful banter or telling jokes.

However, SCP-27's behavior should not be underestimated. He is known to resort to violent means, should his organization's interests or his own well-being be threatened. SCP-27 is a charismatic leader, easily gaining the loyalty and respect of his subordinates.

SCP-27's anomalous properties are currently unknown, and research is ongoing. It is advised to approach with caution and to not underestimate his abilities.
