Item #: SCP-26

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-26 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to her occupation as a fashion designer and the potential for her to design anomalous clothing items, SCP-26 is not to have access to any fabrics or threads within her cell. She is permitted to keep her silver chain as it has been determined to not pose a threat. Any new accessory brought into SCP-26's cell must be thoroughly inspected and approved by level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-26 is a human female with distinct orange stripes on her face. Her eyes are made of VR Jade LED's which do not possess any anomalous properties. SCP-26's head is an iridescent metal blue color, and she has a goggle on her forehead. She wears a gold earring in each ear and a medical mask covering her mouth. SCP-26 has shown the ability to fashion anomalous clothing items and objects, making it important to monitor her access to certain materials and tools.

Personality-wise, SCP-26 is very organized and controlling, often taking charge of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. It has been noted that SCP-26's behavior can lead to humorous situations. SCP-26 will take any opportunity to design new clothing items, even attempting to create clothes out of non-traditional materials, leading to potential safety hazards. 

SCP-26 was recovered in [REDACTED] after reports of clothing items with anomalous properties began surfacing in the fashion industry. SCP Foundation agents were able to track the source of these items to SCP-26's studio, and she was subsequently taken into custody. SCP-26 has since been cooperative with Foundation personnel and has shown a willingness to assist with containment efforts.
