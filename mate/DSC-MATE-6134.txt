SCP-6134 is often seen wearing a medical mask and a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-6134 exhibits a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality, often becoming overly excited about things that others may not find as interesting. This can lead to humorous situations, but also potential danger if SCP-6134's excitement leads to carelessness.

Addendum: Incident Report 6134-A

On ██/██/████, SCP-6134 was observed attempting to rewire the electrical system in its containment chamber. While no harm was done to SCP-6134 or Foundation personnel, the incident highlighted the need for increased monitoring of SCP-6134's abilities and behavior. As a result, SCP-6134's containment procedures have been updated accordingly.
