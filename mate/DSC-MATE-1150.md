Item #: 1150

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-1150 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber should be furnished with a computer workstation and standard amenities for a human subject. DSC-MATE-1150 must be provided with a whistle as it is part of its Accessory.

Interaction with DSC-MATE-1150 should be carried out with caution, as it has displayed certain anthropomorphic characteristics that may make it hard to discern from human individuals.

Description:

DSC-MATE-1150 is a male Monkey with remarkable intelligence and a talent for programming. DSC-MATE-1150 displays a distinctive physical appearance, which includes parted pink hair on its head, gold earrings on its ears, nerd glasses for its vision, and a constantly frightened mouth.

DSC-MATE-1150 has proven to be independent and resourceful in its behavior, often attempting to solve any problem on its own, despite the availability of help from others. DSC-MATE-1150 has also demonstrated a decidedly stubborn streak in its character, often refusing to acknowledge the limits of its capabilities, leading to humorous situations like taking on heavyweight tasks by itself and stubbornly ignoring maps when lost.

DSC-MATE-1150 is equipped with various computer skills, which allow it to bypass firewalls and security protocols with ease. DSC-MATE-1150 has shown a tendency to exhibit emotions typically associated with humans, specifically anger and frustration.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1150 was initially captured by the Foundation while it was attempting to infiltrate a Government facility unlawfully. DSC-MATE-1150 made contact with security officials through hacking measures, which put it on the radar of the Foundation.

DSC-MATE-1150's unique blend of human-like behavior and animalistic tendencies makes it a fascinating study subject. However, its intelligence and programming knowledge could be potent tools in the wrong hands, making continued containment a priority.
