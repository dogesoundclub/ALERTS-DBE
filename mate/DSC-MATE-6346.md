Item #: DSC-MATE-6346

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6346 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with specialized features adapted to its species. DSC-MATE-6346 displays intelligence far above that of a non-anomalous monkey and is to be handled with caution. It is not to have unsupervised contact with any non-foundation personnel or other DSCs. DSC-MATE-6346 is to be fed a specialized diet of insects, fruits, and vegetables, and provided with appropriate environmental enrichment.

Description: DSC-MATE-6346 appears to be a male monkey, roughly the size of a small human, with blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-6346 is always seen wearing a red beanie on its head. DSC-MATE-6346 is known for its mischievous personality and enjoys pushing boundaries to see what happens. It is often seen breaking rules deliberately or searching for loopholes to exploit. DSC-MATE-6346 is not violent, but can be unpredictable, which makes containment difficult.

DSC-MATE-6346 was discovered working as a car salesman before being brought to the foundation's attention due to its anomalous properties. It is capable of speaking in a broken, heavily accented version of English, and displays intelligence above that of non-anomalous monkeys. It has expressed a fondness for cars and has demonstrated exceptional skills in driving and repairing them.

DSC-MATE-6346 possesses the ability to create minor reality distortions, allowing it to manipulate small objects and change minor aspects of its environment. These distortions appear to be under DSC-MATE-6346's conscious control, but it is not yet clear what limitations, if any, exist to its reality-warping abilities.

Addendum: While DSC-MATE-6346 is a small-scale reality bender, its antics and mischievous personality make it an engaging and frequently amusing DSC to interact with, provided that proper precautions are taken. Researchers are advised not to underestimate DSC-MATE-6346's intelligence, quick thinking, and problem-solving abilities.
