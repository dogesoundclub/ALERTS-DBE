Item #: DSC-MATE-340

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-340 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not actively performing their duties as a law enforcement officer. Under no circumstances is DSC-MATE-340 to be given access to any firearms or other lethal weapons, as their strong sense of duty may lead to excessive use of force.

Description: DSC-MATE-340 appears to be an average adult human male, standing at 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 79 kilograms. They have short brown hair, green eyes, and a prominent white scar on their left cheek. Their most distinctive feature is the monk's habit they wear at all times, complete with a hood that obscures their facial features.

DSC-MATE-340's forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles, the purpose of which is currently unknown. They also wear a green cross earring in their left ear, and sport a silver chain around their neck. Perhaps most strikingly, DSC-MATE-340 wears an LED gas mask over their face, which emits a constant low hum when in use.

DSC-MATE-340's personality is defined by their strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can sometimes lead to them taking on too much at once. They are a dedicated police officer, and go to great lengths to ensure the safety and protection of their community. However, this can sometimes lead to them becoming overwhelmed or overburdened, and they may struggle to balance their duties with their personal life.

DSC-MATE-340 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become defensive or belligerent if they perceive a threat to their community. They have been known to take extreme measures to protect innocent civilians, even at great personal risk to themselves. As such, caution should be exercised when interacting with DSC-MATE-340, as they may react with force if they feel threatened or provoked.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-340 has expressed a desire to be granted access to more advanced weaponry and equipment, citing the need for greater protection in the face of increasing threats to their community. This request has been denied pending further review by Foundation personnel.
