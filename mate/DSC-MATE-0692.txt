Item #: SCP-692

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-692 is to be allowed to continue his employment as a train driver. Authority has deemed it necessary that SCP-692 keeps a healthy social network, while being under covert surveillance. SCP-692's family and friends are to be monitored and reported on regularly.

Description: SCP-692 is a human male, wearing a red beanie and a green cross earring. His most notable feature is his smile, which is perpetually present on his face. SCP-692 is prone to telling jokes and making silly impersonations. SCP-692 has also demonstrated an ability to lift the mood of even the most depressed individuals.

In interviews with Foundation staff, SCP-692 expresses a deep desire to make people happy, and has stated that his goal is to become the happiest person on the planet. SCP-692's past is still unknown, though it appears he has no history of anomalous behaviour.

SCP-692 displays no signs of hostility or malicious behavior, and thus poses a low threat to Foundation operations. Nevertheless, all social interactions and internet activity are to be monitored until further notice.

Addendum: Efforts to introduce SCP-692 to other SCPs under the guise of making them happier have been discontinued after D-Class personnel exhibited anomalous reactions to SCP-692's presence. Further research in this area is pending approval from the Ethics Committee.
