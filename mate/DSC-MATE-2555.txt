Description: SCP-2555 is a humanoid entity with a robotic frame, measuring 1.8 meters in height. Its exterior shell is made of a copper alloy, and its eyes consist of jade-colored LED screens. SCP-2555 typically wear a red beanie on its head and a jade earring on its right ear.

SCP-2555 is a delivery driver by profession and has displayed an exceptional ability to navigate through complex urban environments.

Addendum: SCP-2555 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after an encounter with a group of civilians, who reported seeing a "robotic artist" delivering packages in their neighborhood. Foundation agents intercepted SCP-2555 during one of its routine deliveries and brought it back to Site-███ for further study. SCP-2555 has proven to be cooperative with Foundation personnel and has shown no signs of aggression or malice. However, due to the uncertain nature of SCP-2555's consciousness, further study is required to determine its true nature and capabilities.
