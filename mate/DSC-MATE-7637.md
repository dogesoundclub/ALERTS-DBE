Item #: 7637

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7637, also known as "the Fashion Designer," is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site [REDACTED]. The chamber must have a ventilation system to accommodate the smoke produced from Item 7637's cigarette. Access to the containment chamber must be granted only to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Personnel who wish to interact with Item 7637 must wear protective eyewear to avoid the effects of its anomalous eyes.

Description: Item 7637 is a male monkey humanoid measuring 1.2 meters in height. Its face features a permanently frightened mouth and wears a silver chain around its neck. Item 7637's eyes are in the form of a ski goggle, which causes its gaze to induce dizziness, nausea, and headaches to anyone who sees it without protective eyewear. Its ears have a jade earring attached to them, and it habitually smokes cigarettes.

Item 7637 is a fashion designer by profession and has produced an eccentric line of clothing favored by several celebrities. However, it's known to use its anomalous properties to gain an advantage in the fashion industry. Item 7637 has a laid-back personality, but its fierce loyalty and protectiveness towards loved ones often leads to conflict with those who insult or threaten them.

Addendum: Item 7637 came to the Foundation's attention when several witnesses reported feeling dizzy, disoriented, and sick after attending a fashion show by the designer. Reports suggest that Item 7637 had been using its eyes to control the audience's reactions to the clothing line. After a successful containment by the Foundation, Item 7637 has been cooperative and poses minimal harm to personnel.
