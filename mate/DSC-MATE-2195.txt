Item #: 2195

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: Object 2195 has been successfully neutralized and its properties are no longer a threat to the general population. All pertinent data, recordings, and follow-up investigations have been archived for future reference.

Description: Object 2195 has been identified as a human female, with distinguishing orange stripes on her face, and a perpetually smiling expression. The subject's eyes are of a blue clown hue, and their head is often adorned with a hoodie for unknown reasons. Their mouth is obscured by a medical mask, which may or may not have been worn as a protective measure. Object 2195 is often seen wearing a gold chain, which does not seem to have any anomalous properties.

The subject has been identified as a veterinarian by profession, with a keen analytic and logical mind. Alongside these traits, Object 2195 has a quirky sense of humor that may involve witty observations and dry, deadpan teasing directed towards even their closest friends.

Addendum: Object 2195 came to the attention of the Foundation after a series of unusual events involving animal attacks and strange illnesses in the local area. Upon investigation, it was found that these occurrences were indeed of an anomalous nature and traced back to the subject.

After a thorough debriefing and subsequent testing, Object 2195 proved to be cooperative and fully aware of their abilities. With the aid of the Foundation, the subject was able to neutralize their anomalous properties, and a containment breach was avoided.

Object 2195 has since returned to their normal profession, and shows no signs of further anomalous behavior. Future monitoring will continue as a precautionary measure.
