SCP-8520 is a notable example of a rabbit species that has developed remarkable intelligence, taking up the role of a real estate agent within human society. The subject appears to be male, featuring a hoodie over its head and prominently displaying a red victory band on its forehead. The most striking feature of SCP-8520's face is its perpetually frightened mouth, which gives the impression of constant anxiety.

Despite this, SCP-8520 exhibits a deep curiosity about the world and a love for knowledge, particularly in obscure or unusual topics. This frequently results in humorous situations, as SCP-8520 can often be found spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, much to their confusion or annoyance. SCP-8520's love of learning and thirst for knowledge may also make it more susceptible to manipulation or deception by more predatory entities.

SCP-8520 is often seen carrying a whistle as an accessory, possibly for self-defense purposes due to its smaller size and potential vulnerability. As a sentient species, SCP-8520 should be treated with the same respect and caution as any other intelligent being encountered in the field.
