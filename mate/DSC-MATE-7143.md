Subject 7143, also known as Officer Jadesong, is a human female police officer assigned to the department of supernatural law enforcement. Her distinctive features include her glowing VR jade LED eyes, which enable her to see in the dark and identify blood types with ease, as well as her trademark red cross earring, which she wears as a symbol of her dedication to her duty.

In addition to her police uniform, Officer Jadesong is rarely seen without her trusty medical mask, which she wears to protect herself and others from airborne pathogens and to filter out unwanted distractions while on duty. She also wears a choker as a reminder of her purpose and the importance of her job.

While Officer Jadesong is known for her strong sense of responsibility and duty to protect society from the supernatural, she is also a fun-loving individual who enjoys dancing and singing along to her favorite songs. Her outgoing personality has led to many humorous situations, including getting suspects to confess their crimes by singing along to popular songs or getting fellow officers to join in on musical street performances during urban patrols.

Subject 7143 is to be considered highly trained and skilled in urban exploration, self-defense, and investigation. Approach with caution and respect. Mission priority is to provide assistance in paranormal investigations and suppression of potential public safety concerns.
