Item #: SCP-1540

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1540 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to limited electrical equipment. Access to television and music is permitted, but monitored to ensure that SCP-1540 doesn't become overly emotional.

SCP-1540 is to be provided with therapy sessions to monitor their emotional state and address any potential negative effects.

SCP-1540's electrician license has been revoked, and they are not allowed to work with electrical equipment outside of Foundation-approved projects.

Description: SCP-1540 is a human male with a distinctive mouth spot on their upper lip. Their eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and their head is often covered by a bucket hat. SCP-1540 also has a two-color band marking on their forehead and wears a gold earring in their left ear.

SCP-1540's personality is noticeably affected by strong emotional stimuli, and they have shown an appreciation for music and art that evokes powerful reactions. SCP-1540 has a tendency to be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, which can result in a significant emotional response.

SCP-1540's emotional sensitivity has been found to have a mild psychic ability, enabling them to affect electrical equipment through their emotional state. This ability has the potential to cause electrical surges or failures if left uncontrolled.

Addendum: Due to SCP-1540's emotional sensitivity, it has been recommended that Foundation personnel avoid discussing traumatic or particularly emotional subjects around SCP-1540 to prevent potential negative reactions.
