SCP-866, known as the "Harmonious Don," is a female human with striking orange stripes on her face, accentuating her welcoming smile. She often wears normal glasses that obscure her eyes and sports 90s brown hair. Her green cross earring is a distinctive mark, glinting against her skin in the light. A silver chain dangles from her neck, a symbol of her status as a mafia boss. 

SCP-866 values harmony and social connections, often fostering both within her organization. Despite her position, she has a humorous side that she enjoys displaying, often engaging in playful banter or telling jokes to those around her. 

As a mafia boss, SCP-866 is highly respected and feared within both the criminal underworld and outside communities. Her charm and charisma have allowed her to maintain a low profile, avoiding unwanted attention from law enforcement. However, any who cross her or her organization have been known to disappear without a trace. 

SCP-866 is a unique and dangerous entity, not to be underestimated. Approach with caution, and only under strict protocol.
