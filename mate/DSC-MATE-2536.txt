SCP-2536, codenamed "The Programmer", is a female human of unidentified background. She is easily distinguishable by her striking red lips and the unkept wild green hair that surrounds her head. Her forehead bears the glow of a strange two-colored band, which seems to emit an unknown energy. 

The Programmer prefers to wear a gold chain around her neck, and often pairs it with a peculiar LED gas mask, the purpose of which is currently unknown. Despite her mysterious attire, SCP-2536 has shown to possess a great sense of humor, and delights in making others laugh. 

It is worth noting that her humor can sometimes lead to unpredictable situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Despite this, SCP-2536 is a valuable addition to the Foundation, bringing levity and joy to an otherwise gloomy environment. Her programming skills are unparalleled, and she is often called upon to assist in various coding endeavors. 

As with all SCPs, access to SCP-2536 is heavily restricted, with all interactions monitored and recorded. While her jovial nature can bring comfort to those around her, it is important to remember that she remains a dangerous and potentially volatile entity. Any breach in security, no matter how small, must be reported immediately to the appropriate personnel.
