Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3139 is to be kept inside a standard humanoid containment chamber.

Description: DSC-MATE-3139 is a human female of indeterminate age, exhibiting various anomalous features. Most notable are the multicolored spots covering the entirety of the skin. These spots react to emotional states, rapidly changing color and brightness according to the individual's mood. DSC-MATE-3139 is always seen wearing a LED headset, which is connected to the mask she wears over her face. This mask has proven capable of filtering dangerous gases and amplifying sound and visual stimuli, although the exact mechanism behind this ability is unknown.

DSC-MATE-3139 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence, often refusing assistance or guidance even in situations where doing so would be beneficial. This personality trait has led to several incidents where DSC-MATE-3139 has attempted to handle tasks outside of their capabilities or navigate unfamiliar areas without clear directions. Despite this, DSC-MATE-3139 has shown remarkable resilience and resourcefulness, able to improvise and adapt to changing circumstances.

It is still unknown what caused DSC-MATE-3139's anomalous condition or how it affects the human body. Further observation and testing are required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3139's abilities and any potential risks associated with them.
