Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9687 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber with no access to art supplies or writing materials. All artwork and written material created by the subject must be confiscated and analyzed for potential anomalous properties.

Description: Subject 9687 is a humanoid female who appears to be in her mid-thirties. Her face features orange stripes that run along her cheeks and forehead, and she wears a pair of regular glasses. Her blonde hair is styled with an elegant wing, and she wears a green cross earring in one ear.

The subject carries a silver chain as an accessory at all times. Despite her ordinary appearance, 9687 exhibits extraordinary artistic talent in various forms. She has an uncanny ability to imbue her creations with anomalous powers.

Subjects with artistic abilities are known to manifest anomalous properties, and 9687 is no exception. Her artworks and written material often contain anomalous properties that can affect those who view or read them. The extent of her abilities is unknown, but the Foundation has classified her as high-risk.

Personality: The subject appears to have a kind and gentle demeanor, with a creative and artistic side that is expressed through her various hobbies and interests. She enjoys painting, drawing, writing, and other forms of artistic expression, but her art always has a dark twist.

As noted in her file, 9687's creations tend to be imbued with anomalous properties, which she seems to be unaware of or indifferent towards. Her actions and intentions appear to be aligned with any typical human, and it is unclear whether her abilities are a conscious decision or automatic response.

Addendum: Subject 9687 has recently found employment as a banker, and her skills and abilities have gained her notoriety within the industry. The Foundation is monitoring her interactions with colleagues and clients to prevent any potential anomalies from manifesting. Further research into her abilities is ongoing.
