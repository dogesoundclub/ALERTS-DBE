Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8511, known to the general public as "The Banker," is to be monitored at all times via CCTV and other covert means. Due to her possession of a unique set of cybernetic enhancements, which grant her the capabilities to access sensitive information, Subject 8511 has been deemed a potential security threat, and as such, is to be closely observed. If any details surface regarding any plans or schemes she may have, an update of her clearance level should be considered.

Description: Subject 8511 appears to be a human female, approximately 28 years old, of average height and build. She is often observed wearing a silver chain and a unique LED-enabled gas mask. The gas mask is believed to provide some sort of benefit in terms of filtering out airborne contaminants or providing enhanced vision or other sensory abilities, though the exact purpose of the mask is unknown.

Subject 8511 has a distinctly jovial personality, often engaging in playful arguments and debates with anyone who will humor her. Her quick wit and inherent charm allow her to diffuse difficult situations with ease, and she is often seen with a smile on her face. However, it is believed that her true motives are often obscured by her social facade, and her seemingly harmless pranks may be covering up more sinister intentions.

Authorization for direct contact with Subject 8511 is prohibited, and any attempts to engage her in conversation should be relayed to higher authorities immediately.

Additional Note: Be advised, Subject 8511 is extremely proficient in accessing and utilizing sensitive information for her own gain.
