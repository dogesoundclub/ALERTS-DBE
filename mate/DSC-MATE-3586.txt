Item #: 3586

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3586 is to be treated as a normal human and allowed to continue their job as an electrician without any interference. SCP-3586 is to be monitored for any unusual behavior that may pose a threat to themselves or the general public. Their access to cigarettes is to be limited to ensure they do not cause any potential harm to themselves or others.

Description: SCP-3586 is a humanoid entity with orange stripes on their face and a pink rabbit head. They have red cross earrings and a choker around their neck. Their eyes are VR Jade LED and they often are seen with a cigarette in their hand. They have the physical appearance of a female human.

SCP-3586 has an empathetic and compassionate personality. They often take on the problems of others and feel the need to fix all that is wrong. This tendency can be both admirable and problematic for SCP-3586, as it can lead to them becoming exhausted and overwhelmed. 

SCP-3586's abilities as an electrician are average, with no outstanding abilities. The cause of their unique appearance and features is currently unknown. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and potential implications of SCP-3586.

Addendum: A routine medical examination revealed that SCP-3586 has an unusually high level of cybernetic implants, which may explain their unique features. Further analysis is required to determine the extent and capabilities of these enhancements.
