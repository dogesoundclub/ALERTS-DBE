Item #: DSC-MATE-3237

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3237 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be provided with a comfortable living environment and appropriate sustenance. 

Description: DSC-MATE-3237 is a male primate of the Monkey species. It stands at approximately 1.2 meters tall and is often found wearing a bucket hat and a gold chain. DSC-MATE-3237 behaves in a manner typical of its species, displaying a high level of intelligence and dexterity.

DSC-MATE-3237's anomalous properties manifest in its tendency to fix objects and problems in unconventional ways. It may use duct tape, paper clips or other makeshift solutions to repair broken objects, or to find solutions to problems that others would find too complicated. This trait has been observed in DSC-MATE-3237's previous occupation as a train driver, where it has been noted to be highly resourceful in fixing various malfunctions and issues with the train.

DSC-MATE-3237 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but has been known to become agitated if prevented from being able to carry out repairs or if its resources are limited. It has a preference for candy sticks, and has been observed to become more compliant if offered this item as a reward.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3237 was discovered during a routine investigation into a malfunctioning train in [REDACTED]. It was noted to be wearing a gold chain and a bucket hat while attempting to fix the train, and was found to possess anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-3237 was taken into Foundation custody without incident.
