Item #: 5296

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5296 is to be contained in a Level 4 secure facility in a soundproof, electromagnetic pulse resistant chamber. The chamber is to be monitored by security personnel at all times. SCP-5296 is to be restrained with a straitjacket and sedated via IV drip on a daily basis. Any interaction with SCP-5296 must be conducted through a speaker system from a separate room. 

Description: SCP-5296 is a female human with orange stripes on her face and red clown eyes. She has pig tails and wears a medical mask to cover her mouth. She is often seen wearing a gold chain. SCP-5296 exhibits a thirst for knowledge and has been known to spend hours researching obscure topics. She is known to collect books, documentaries, and other educational materials. SCP-5296 is highly intelligent and can be quite passionate about sharing her newfound knowledge with others.

However, SCP-5296 poses a significant threat to the safety of human society. She has demonstrated an ability to influence and manipulate individuals through her extensive knowledge and charismatic personality. Those who come into contact with SCP-5296 are at risk of being subjugated to her will, becoming pawns in her schemes. SCP-5296 has shown a disregard for human life and will do whatever it takes to achieve her goals.

Addendum: Incident 5296-A - On ██/██/████, SCP-5296 managed to break containment and escape from the facility. She was discovered in a nearby town, where she had taken over a local public library. SCP-5296 had brainwashed several individuals into serving as her minions, and had begun a process of converting the library into a headquarters for her operations. The Foundation was able to recontain SCP-5296 without significant casualties, but the incident serves as a reminder of her dangerous potential. Containment procedures have since been updated and reinforced to prevent any future escapes.
