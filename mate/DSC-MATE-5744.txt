Item #: SCP-5744

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5744 is to be kept at Site-██ under standard humanoid containment protocols. Access to SCP-5744 is restricted to Level-2 personnel and above. SCP-5744 is required to wear the standard security guard uniform and to carry a gas mask at all times.

Description: SCP-5744 appears to be a female human of Asian descent with jade earrings and a choker. SCP-5744's most notable feature is her constant smile, which adds a deceptive ease to her appearance. Her normal glasses obscure minimally pigmented eyes behind which appear to be devoid of any noteworthy anomaly.

SCP-5744's personality is characterized by an adherence to tradition, and a semblance of a no-nonsense attitude that is tempered by a latent playful side; her willingness to jest with others is evidence of this. SCP-5744 is known to tell jokes and stories that have been passed down through her family or community, and this further highlights her playful personality. This personality manifests in humorous situations that endear her to her colleagues.

Despite her outwardly congenial demeanor, SCP-5744 is noted for her keen attention to detail and her thorough work ethic. SCP-5744 has shown herself to be diligent, responsible, and committed to performing her job exceedingly well, as evidenced by consistent positive feedback from her superiors as a Security guard within the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-5744 participated in a psychological evaluation after her initial containment. She was noted to be remarkably resistant to cognitohazardous and memetic effects. Further testing in this area is being considered.
