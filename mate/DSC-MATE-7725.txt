Item #: SCP-7725

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7725 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a single exit. The temperature of the chamber is to be kept at a constant 22 degrees Celsius. SCP-7725 is to be provided with standard-issue clothing, as well as a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. Personnel are prohibited from interacting with SCP-7725 outside of scheduled interviews and tests.

SCP-7725 is to be closely monitored for any signs of abnormal behavior or deviations from its standard routine.

Description:

SCP-7725 is a humanoid entity with brown hair from the 1990s that stands at 170 cm tall. It is biologically female and possesses Electronic Contact Lenses that display a rotating pattern of rainbow colors. SCP-7725 is fond of wearing a gold chain necklace and gold earrings, as well as smoking cigarettes.

SCP-7725 is a theater manager, and has demonstrated exceptional skills in the areas of organization and management. It is able to multitask and coordinate a variety of tasks simultaneously with ease. In its daily routine, SCP-7725 has displayed an unusual level of attachment with inanimate objects such as its car, potted plants, and household appliances. This has led to anthropomorphization of its belongings.

SCP-7725 is consistently caring and nurturing towards all it encounters, both animate and inanimate. This has become a cause of concern for Foundation personnel due to SCP-7725's ability to form strong emotional bonds with seemingly unrelated objects.

SCP-7725 has not displayed any hostile behavior towards Foundation personnel or other humans since its containment. However, personnel are still advised to exercise caution and be mindful of SCP-7725's behavior around inanimate objects.

Addendum:

SCP-7725 has displayed an unusual level of perception and problem-solving. During interviews, it has displayed an understanding of topics and concepts beyond its experience, leading personnel to believe that it possesses anomalous cognitive abilities. However, further testing is required to confirm this hypothesis.
