SCP-9989 works as a mechanic and was first discovered by the Foundation when a local police department requested assistance with a vehicle that had been damaged in an accident. SCP-9989 displayed the ability to repair the vehicle with seemingly supernatural ability, leading the Foundation to believe that SCP-9989 possesses anomalous properties.

SCP-9989's personality is characterized by her deep empathy and understanding for others. SCP-9989 may become emotional and shed tears when witnessing the pain and suffering of others. She has a particular fondness for animals and nature, often stopping to help injured animals and to care for plants in her spare time.

Addendum: During a routine medical examination, it was discovered that SCP-9989 has an unusually high level of endogenous opioids in her bloodstream, leading researchers to believe that this is linked to her empathetic abilities. Further testing is ongoing.
