SCP-8708 is a humanoid creature that goes by the name of "The Firefighter" within the urban fantasy world. His appearance is a combination of numerous disturbing features, including a prominent mouth spot, a frightened mouth, and ski goggle eyes that are unsettling to look at. SCP-8708 has a head of green hair tucked neatly under the vibrant purple cap he wears at all times, accentuating his surreal appearance. Two distinguishing features of SCP-8708 are the jade earring on his left ear and the medical mask that covers his face. 

Although SCP-8708 is a human, his appearance is anything but normal. He has a penchant for unusual hobbies and collecting objects that are not considered ordinary by most. The Firefighter has an incredibly vivid imagination and creative streak, which he brings to life by writing poetry and creating elaborate cosplay costumes. SCP-8708's interests are not something to be trifled with, as he has been known to use his abilities to achieve his goals, often causing mayhem in the process. 

The gold chain is another item that SCP-8708 always wears around his neck, and it serves as a symbol of his dominance over those who dare to cross his path. Despite his erratic behavior and distinct appearance, SCP-8708 has proved to be an effective firefighter, often using his unique abilities to battle flames without injury. However, those who know of SCP-8708's true nature are wary of his unpredictable behavior and often avoid him at all costs.
