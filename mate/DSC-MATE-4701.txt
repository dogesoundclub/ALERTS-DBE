SCP-4701, also known as "The Tiger Anchor," is a humanoid tiger with a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue. He works as a news anchor, delivering reports with precision and authority that leaves viewers spellbound.

Despite his animalistic appearance, SCP-4701 wears a pair of nerd glasses on his piercing green eyes, and sports a bucket hat on his head. He is often seen with a red scarf tied around his neck and a candy stick clasped between his sharp teeth.

Known to be highly organized and efficient, SCP-4701 has a tendency to take charge of events and delegate tasks in his matter-of-fact way. While this can come across as controlling, he always has the best intentions in mind.

SCP-4701's commanding presence and intellect make him well-suited for his chosen profession. However, his tigress instincts can sometimes get the better of him, leading him to make impulsive decisions that have the potential to cause chaos.

Approach with caution, as SCP-4701 is not to be trifled with.
