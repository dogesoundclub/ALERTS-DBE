Item #: 6341

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6341 is currently contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its tendency towards compassion and nurturing behavior, all personnel interacting with 6341 must undergo a background check to ensure they are not in need of emotional support or sympathy. 

Description: 6341 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, measuring approximately 50 cm in height and weighing 10 kilograms. Its most notable features are its ski goggle eyes and black hair on its head. The subject also wears a gold earring in its left ear and a gold chain around its neck.

6341 possesses the ability to anthropomorphize objects, with a particular affinity toward inanimate objects. It has been documented to give cars names, have conversations with plants, and even treat household appliances as if they were living beings. 6341 is also known to be very caring towards its fellow macaques, and has been observed practicing empathy towards injured or sick individuals.

Personality: 6341 is generally perceived as friendly and nurturing, though this behavior should not be misconstrued as kindness towards humans. The subject can be unpredictable at times, prone to outbursts and anger when it perceives harm to its "friends" or objects. Due to its erratic behavior and refusal to interact with most human beings, caution is advised when interacting with 6341. 

Addendum: 6341 has been known to gather and hoard objects it deems important, regardless of their value or use. These objects are to be removed on a regular basis to prevent the possible accumulation of dangerous or anomalous items within the subject's containment chamber.
