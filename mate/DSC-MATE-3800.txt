SCP-3800, known commonly as "The Mechanic," is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing at approximately 2 feet tall. Its eyes are often seen hidden behind a pair of horned-rim glasses, giving it an air of intellectualism. Its head is adorned with a blue bandana, a nod to its old-school roots, while its neck is draped with a gold chain, seemingly a fashionable choice for the primate.

SCP-3800's personality is often described as jovial and careless, with a tendency to get sidetracked easily. Its scatterbrained nature is often on display as it forgets appointments and loses its way, leading to comical mishaps. Despite its absentmindedness, The Mechanic is a skilled craftsman, with an affinity for engines and machines. Its curiosity and ingenuity have led it to modify various machinery, creating complex mechanisms beyond its primate peers.

As of yet, there is no known explanation for SCP-3800's peculiar habits and abilities. However, it is classified as safe due to its non-aggressive nature and cooperative attitude towards Foundation personnel. SCP-3800's mechanical knowledge, combined with its playful demeanor, make it an unexpected ally in the ongoing battle against paranormal anomalies.
