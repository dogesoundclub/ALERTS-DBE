SCP-78, codenamed "The Harebrained Joker," is a mischievous villain of the urban fantasy world. This male rabbit is easily identifiable by its red clown eyes, a stark contrast against its purple cap adorned with a headset. The Harebrained Joker also boasts a gold earring and a flashy gold chain around his neck. 

But don't let his humorous appearance fool you - this rabbit packs a dangerous punch. With a penchant for practical jokes and a twisted sense of humor, The Harebrained Joker often pulls off elaborate heists with a smile on his face. His love for candy sticks serves as both a treat for him and a calling card for his notorious mischief, often leaving them at the scene of the crime. 

Approach SCP-78 with caution, as his unpredictable nature and fondness for stirring up chaos may prove dangerous to unsuspecting agents. However, if you catch him in a good mood, the Harebrained Joker may just offer up a few jokes or impersonations to lighten the mood - just don't let your guard down for too long.
