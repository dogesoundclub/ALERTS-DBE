Item #: 2589

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2589 is to be monitored regularly for any potential anomalous properties. However, due to their status as a human and the lack of any observable supernatural abilities, no further containment procedures are necessary at this time. 

However, it is currently recommended to avoid exposing 2589 to any information about potentially dangerous anomalies as their profession as a reporter has shown them to have a tenacious curiosity that sometimes extends to their own detriment.

Description:

Subject 2589 is a human female with 90s brown hair and normal glasses. They frequently wear a jade earring in one ear and a medical mask over their mouth, potentially due to concerns over illness or allergies. They can often be seen with a gold chain around their neck.

One distinguishing feature of the subject is the goggle on their forehead, which may be worn for fashion purposes or practical use in potentially hazardous situations. 

The subject's personality is notable for their dry sense of humor, often catching individuals off guard with their deadpan jokes. Despite not considering themselves to be the "life of the party," their ability to deliver humor with ease often makes them a valued addition to social outings.

Initial observations have yet to uncover any anomalous properties of the subject, but continued monitoring is recommended.
