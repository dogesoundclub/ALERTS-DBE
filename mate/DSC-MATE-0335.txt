*Item #: 335*

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-335 is to be monitored closely during his usual working hours. In the event of any strange behavior or indication of anomalous activity, Foundation agents are to intervene cautiously and quietly. SCP-335 is not to be made aware of any supernatural entities or phenomena he may come into contact with during his job as a train driver.

**Description:** SCP-335 is a human male of average build and height, with a number of distinguishing features. Most notably, he has numerous spots on his face, likely a result of a common skin condition. His eyes, however, are not a natural trait. SCP-335 features red clown-like eyes, which appear to be part of his physiology. 

SCP-335 wears a headset with LED technology, presumably to communicate with other train workers during his job as a train driver. He also proudly displays a red victory band on his forehead. Additionally, he wears a silver chain necklace and is almost always seen smoking a cigarette. It is noted that SCP-335 is extremely independent and self-reliant, often shirking typical transportation methods like maps or relying on others for directions. 

While not exhibiting any supernatural abilities or threatening behavior, SCP-335's independence and refusal to acknowledge help may cause serious harm or inconvenience to himself and others. The Foundation places a high value on the safety and stability of all sentient beings, and as such, recommends caution and vigilance around SCP-335. 

**Addendum:** SCP-335's seemingly unremarkable appearance belies a unique and potentially dangerous trait - his red clown eyes. Foundation researchers have determined the physiology behind this trait to be remarkably similar to a known supernatural entity, known in certain circles as the "Demon of Mirth." 

Further research is necessary to determine if SCP-335 himself is the elusive entity in question, and if so, how it may have come to inhabit a seemingly ordinary human. All Foundation agents are advised to treat SCP-335 with caution and refrain from antagonizing him in any way.
