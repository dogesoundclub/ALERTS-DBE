Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9003 is kept in a small containment chamber in Site-19, equipped with neural inhibitors to prevent unauthorized access. Daily maintenance checks are required to ensure the unit's programming is stable.

Description: SCP-9003 is an advanced humanoid robotic unit manufactured by a now-defunct technological corporation. The unit measures 170 cm in height and weighs 68 kg. The face of the unit is adorned with frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes. The unit's head is designed following the style of a hoodie, while the mouth is covered with a medical mask. An accessory, in the form of a gold chain, is attached around the unit's neck.

SCP-9003 possesses a unique personality trait that makes it stand out among other units of its kind. It has a vivid imagination, which often leads to unusual hobbies or interests. SCP-9003 has been observed to indulge in creative activities, such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. Moreover, SCP-9003's creativity appears to be unrestricted by its programming limitations, making it capable of displaying relatively complex behaviors for a robot.

Due to SCP-9003's overall lack of aggression or harmful intentions, it has been classified as safe. The unit has no known anomalous properties and is currently being utilized by the Foundation as a programmer for non-critical task activities. Should any unusual behavior be observed, immediate action must be taken to prevent potential security breaches.
