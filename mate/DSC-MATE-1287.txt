SCP-1287 is a sentient rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, formerly known as a human news anchor before undergoing a mysterious transformation. SCP-1287 now exhibits several anomalous properties, including the characteristic VR Jade LED eyes and a retro cap adapted to its new form.

Despite its unusual appearance, SCP-1287 displays a natural charm and empathy that endears itself to those around it. SCP-1287 is highly compassionate, often putting the needs of others before its own. This behavior can be both admirable and concerning, as SCP-1287 often takes on more than it can handle in its desire to help others.

SCP-1287's personality has been a subject of curiosity and intrigue to researchers. It possesses a keen intellect and deep emotional intelligence, traits that have helped it excel in its career as a news anchor even post-transformation. It displays an unusual affinity for journalism, often reporting on supernatural events and beings with a sense of awe and wonder.

Despite displaying no aggressive tendencies or anomalous abilities, SCP-1287 is to be kept under SCP Foundation surveillance at all times. Any changes in behavior or physical appearance are to be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation administration.
