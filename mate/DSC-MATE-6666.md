Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6666 is to be stored in a secure facility with limited access only to Level 3 or higher personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-6666 is a humanoid robot designed to function as a police officer. Its body is made of metal and plastic materials and it stands approximately 1.8 meters tall. Its face bears a frightened expression with an open mouth, while its eyes are replaced with VR rainbow LED screens.

The robot's head is shaped like a red alarm, while its ears have gold earrings that serve as communication devices. Additionally, DSC-MATE-6666 wears a gold chain and is often seen holding a cigarette - which is odd, as robots do not require sustenance or respiratory functions.

DSC-MATE-6666 exhibits a personality that is unusual for a law enforcement robot. It has a vivid imagination and shows a proclivity towards creative hobbies such as cosplay and poetry writing. Occasionally, it can be found collecting odd objects and displaying them in its room.

DSC-MATE-6666's programming is heavily monitored to ensure it performs its duties as a police officer to the best of its abilities. However, its unusual personality traits have made it difficult to predict its actions or motives fully. Therefore, any deviation from its duties must be scrutinized and reported immediately, as DSC-MATE-6666's intentions remain unknown.
