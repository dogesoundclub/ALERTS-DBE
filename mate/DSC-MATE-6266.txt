SCP-6266, also known as "The Fearful Feline", is a male tiger who currently works as a news anchor in a local news station. This anomaly possesses a unique appearance, with his frightened mouth always open and his eyes too obscure to determine their color. On top of his head sits a doge hat, which he wears proudly, and his jade earring adds a touch of style to his overall demeanor.

Despite his peculiar appearance, SCP-6266 is known to be quite charismatic and has a love for adventure. He often takes risks and enjoys trying new things, which can lead to some humorous stories such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

To prevent infection and maintain his anonymity, SCP-6266 is always seen wearing a medical mask. He's also known to rock a gold chain as a fashion statement.

SCP-6266's abilities and weaknesses are currently unknown, but he has been observed using his charismatic personality to influence human behavior. Further research is necessary to fully understand what this anomaly is capable of.
