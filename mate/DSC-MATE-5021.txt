SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-5021 is a humanoid entity with identification number 5021, presumed to be of the species Homo sapiens. It is a female individual who works as a programmer. The subject displays unique physical traits, including red lips, orange eyebrows, green hair in a purple cap, and golden earrings. It is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying an LED gas mask as additional accessories.

The subject's personality traits showcase a high level of energy and enthusiasm in its demeanor. Its behavior towards others is often enthusiastic and exciting, and it tends to get excited about things that others do not find as interesting. However, these emotional responses tend to be short-lived, and the subject gets back to its rationalself soon enough. Encounters with SCP-5021 in its workplace have been amusing and often entertaining, describing the subject as a comic relief for having a quirky sense of humor.

SCP-5021's anomalous abilities are currently unknown, but containment procedures have been put in place to monitor its activities. Due to its erratic behavior, strict surveillance is conducted to ensure that SCP-5021 remains cooperative and does not pose any threats to others. It has been determined that engagement with the subject is harmless, and it possesses no immediate threat against the Foundation's operations. However, researchers have recommended continuing evaluation of the subject's abilities and behavior for further study.
