Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9764 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell is to be furnished with a fast-food worker uniform and a small kitchen area which includes a grill and deep fryer. DSC-MATE-9764 is allowed to cook food as a form of stress relief, but any object used in the process must be inspected before and after each use. DSC-MATE-9764 is to be monitored at all times by audio and video surveillance. Personnel are prohibited from making prolonged eye contact with DSC-MATE-9764 to avoid potential adverse effects.

Description: DSC-MATE-9764 is a human female with red clown eyes, wearing a metal blue headpiece, a choker, and consistently smoking a cigarette. They work as a fast food worker at a local restaurant in [REDACTED], often seen smiling enthusiastically while serving customers. The subject's personality is described as strong-willed and decisive. DSC-MATE-9764 appears to be in their late twenties and stands at a height of 1.7 meters.

DSC-MATE-9764 is capable of inducing compliance in those around them, usually by issuing orders or commands. This effect is less intense when DSC-MATE-9764 is not in a fast food work environment. DSC-MATE-9764 was discovered after a series of incidents involving customers and co-workers inexplicably following their directions without question. Subsequent interactions with Foundation personnel confirmed the anomalous nature of DSC-MATE-9764.

Addendum: Testing has shown that DSC-MATE-9764's effect weakens when subjected to loud noises, such as alarms or sirens. This effect may be useful in containing DSC-MATE-9764 in case of emergencies. Further testing is ongoing to determine the limits of DSC-MATE-9764's abilities.
