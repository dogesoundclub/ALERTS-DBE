Item #: 3279

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3279 must reside in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All staff members that interact with SCP-3279 must wear gloves and avoid sudden movements, as SCP-3279 is easily frightened.

Description: SCP-3279 is a male rabbit, standing approximately 60 cm tall. SCP-3279's face features a frightened expression, with its mouth perpetually agape. It wears a pair of normal glasses over its eyes, and a pair of goggles on its forehead. SCP-3279 sports a single gold earring on its left ear, and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-3279 also carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-3279 is a lawyer by profession and has displayed personality traits that are unusual for its species. SCP-3279 frequently engages in impulsive and spontaneous behavior and enjoys taking risks. This behavior leads to SCP-3279 getting into humorous situations, such as suddenly deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river.

SCP-3279's anomalous properties manifest through its ability to manipulate probability. SCP-3279 can influence probability in its favor, increasing the chances of success for any impulsive or risky behavior it engages in. The extent of this ability is currently unknown, and further testing is required.

SCP-3279 has shown no signs of hostility or aggression towards humans or other SCP entities. However, staff members must handle SCP-3279 with care, being mindful of its easily frightened nature.

Addendum: SCP-3279 is available for consultation on any legal matters, within the limits of the SCP Foundation's policies. However, any legal counsel or advice given by SCP-3279 is to be cross-checked with legal experts and professionals outside the Foundation.
