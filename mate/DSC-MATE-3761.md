Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3761 is to be monitored at all times while on the premises of the veterinary clinic. It is required to wear its retro cap and glasses at all times while in public. Any attempts at unauthorized use of its sharp intellect are to be reported to the Foundation immediately.

Description: Subject 3761 is a male monkey, appearing to be a member of the species Macaca mulatta, standing at approximately 45 cm in height. Its features include a pair of horned rim glasses and a striking red scarf, occasionally accompanied by a cigarette dangling from its lips.

Despite its non-human form, Subject 3761 has demonstrated human-like intelligence and communication abilities. It is capable of engaging in spirited debate and dazzling listeners with its wit and charm. This trait has become a double-edged sword, as it is prone to engaging in arguments with friends and family members on a purely playful basis.

Subject 3761 has a reputation for mischief and has been known to play pranks on its fellow animals and staff. Its antics are always taken with good humor, as its charismatic charm has softened the hearts of all who come into contact with it.

However, the Foundation must remain vigilant, as there have been reports of 3761 attempting to manipulate its handlers into performing unauthorized activities, such as acquiring food or other items.

In conclusion, Subject 3761 is a fascinating individual with potential uses in both intellectual manipulation and social engineering, warranting careful consideration and monitoring at all times.
