Item #: SCP-4934

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4934 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Its movements are to be strictly monitored, and its activities restricted to its assigned job as a Traffic Officer.

SCP-4934 is allowed to wear its police cap and jade earring in its chamber, but all other accessories are to be removed for safety reasons.

Description: SCP-4934 is a male human with orange stripes on its face and an ever-present smile. Its eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and it wears a medical mask over its mouth. SCP-4934 also wears a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-4934's most notable feature is its energetic and enthusiastic personality, often getting overly excited about certain topics. It may try to get others excited as well, sometimes leading to humorous situations. However, this behavior should not be encouraged as it could lead to containment breaches.

Despite its enthusiastic nature, SCP-4934 is fully capable of performing its job duties as a Traffic Officer. It has not exhibited any anomalous abilities or traits other than its appearance and personality.

SCP-4934 was discovered after reports of a "striped officer" directing traffic in the downtown area. Foundation agents were able to locate and contain SCP-4934 without incident.

Addendum: SCP-4934 has expressed interest in participating in public events and outreach programs to promote traffic safety. This request is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
