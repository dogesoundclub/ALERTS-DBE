DogeSoundClub Profile Entry #1603

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1603 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. All personnel entering the chamber must undergo thorough psychological screening to ensure they are not influenced by the subject's imaginative nature. The subject is permitted to indulge in creative pursuits that do not pose a security risk.

Description: Subject 1603 is a female security guard with striking orange stripes on her face and red lips. She sports a hairstyle consisting of two colorful pigtails and wears a jade earring in each ear. A black choker and a cigarette are never far from her person.

Due to her creative nature, 1603 has eclectic interests, such as poetry writing, cosplay, and collecting peculiar objects. While these hobbies may seem harmless, they have been known to consume the subject's attention for extended periods, leading to lapses in judgment and security oversights.

Remarkably, 1603 possesses an innate ability to turn her imagination into reality. Her impulsivity and vivid fantasy life have manifested themselves into a range of anomalous abilities, such as the power to create objects from thin air or to warp the reality around her.

Personality: 1603's imaginative powers come at a great cost, and her mind is often fraught with chaos and restlessness. A naturally introverted person, she has learned to cope by engaging in creative pursuits and her love of literature. Although her mental state is fragile, she maintains a professional facade, displaying a sense of calm even in high-pressure situations.

Note: Despite her often-detached demeanor, 1603 is a valuable asset to our facility's security force. Her unique talents make her ideal for handling dangerous entities, so long as she can keep control of her vivid imagination.
