In case of any deviation from its designated duties, DSC-MATE-9990 is to be detained and debriefed.

Description: DSC-MATE-9990 is a human male in his early thirties, working as a Traffic Officer in ████████, USA. DSC-MATE-9990 displays two facial features that are unique to its physical appearance. The first feature is a mouth spot, which is a small round red marking on its upper lip. The second feature is a smile, which is a fixed expression on its face, regardless of the state of its mood. DSC-MATE-9990's eyes resemble ski goggles, and it wears a short peak cap on its head. Its ears have green cross-shaped earrings, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-9990 is often seen smoking a cigarette, which it claims helps to improve its focus and concentration while on duty.

DSC-MATE-9990's anomalous effect manifests when it is daydreaming or lost in thought. It has an ability to manipulate time within a 10-meter range around itself. It can slow down time, pause time, or fast forward time. DSC-MATE-9990 has limited control over this ability and can only use it for a maximum of 20 seconds at a time. DSC-MATE-9990's anomalous effect does not affect itself, and it remains unaffected by the time shifts.

DSC-MATE-9990 tends to be very introspective and may spend a lot of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought. However, DSC-MATE-9990 has displayed a level of responsibility and dedication to its job, ensuring traffic flow while on duty.

Addendum: In ██████████████, DSC-MATE-9990's anomalous abilities were discovered when it prevented a collision between two speeding vehicles by pausing time for approximately 10 seconds. Foundation agents were alerted, and DSC-MATE-9990 was subsequently taken into custody for containment and evaluation. DSC-MATE-9990 was deemed safe and was allowed to return to its job under close observation. Further testing and evaluation of DSC-MATE-9990's anomalous abilities are ongoing.
