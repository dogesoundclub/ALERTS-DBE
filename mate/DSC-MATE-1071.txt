Designation: SCP-1071

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1071 is to be monitored at all times and is required to report to the Foundation once per week. SCP-1071 is not to be allowed inside any train cab or engine room of a locomotive under any circumstances. Any attempts to abstain from the scheduled reporting session are to be reported immediately, and retrieval teams will be dispatched.

Description: SCP-1071 is a human female identified as a train driver. The subject's physical features include spots on her face, a purple lip, VR Rainbow LED eyes, an orange side head, and green cross earrings. She frequently wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-1071's personality is characterized by a tendency to be meticulous and detail-oriented. This trait often manifests in simple tasks such as alphabetizing spice racks or color-coding closets, but it can also extend to more complex situations. SCP-1071's obsession with detail has manifested in potentially dangerous scenarios, given her occupation as a train driver. Any attempts to intervene in SCP-1071's rituals have proven to be met with extreme resistance.

SCP-1071's anomalous properties became apparent after she began tampering with the the train's control panels in an effort to further perfect its operation. SCP-1071 is capable of manipulating the train's systems with precise movements, and can improve its efficiency to an unprecedented degree. Additionally, SCP-1071's VR Rainbow LED eyes allow her to perceive and detect mechanical issues with the train that would be impossible for an unaided human eye.

Overall, SCP-1071's powers and behavior pose a significant risk to train travel and transport systems. Further research is necessary to understand the full extent of SCP-1071's abilities and to devise appropriate containment protocols.
