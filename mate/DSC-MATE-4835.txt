Item #: 4835

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4835 is to be monitored closely whilst in the field. They are not to interact with any anomalous entities or locations unless under explicit command from Foundation personnel. In the event of emotional instability, 4835 must be immediately relocated to a secure, Foundation-run facility for psychological evaluation.

Description: Subject 4835 is an adult male of the Homo sapiens species. He is often seen wearing a red victory band around his forehead, and a jade earring in his left earlobe. 4835 requires the use of normal glasses for visual enhancement, and is consistently seen wearing a medical mask over his mouth.

Subject 4835's most notable characteristic is their natural talent for leadership. They often find themselves at the forefront of situations, both within their professional career and personal life. This tendency towards dominance makes them an intimidating presence to those around them, and often garners much respect from their peers. 

However, it is this same personality trait that has led to several emotional outbursts and periods of instability. The Foundation is currently monitoring 4835's emotional state closely, and is prepared to take action in the event of any potential breaches in operational protocol.

Addendum: Subject 4835's profession as a lawyer suggests the potential for legal disputes within the Foundation's operations. As such, all communication between 4835 and the Foundation must be thoroughly vetted and cross-checked to ensure the safety of all involved parties.
