Item #: SCP-4957

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4957 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its position as a politician, it is to be kept under surveillance at all times by at least two armed guards. All interactions with SCP-4957 are to be recorded and analyzed for any potential anomalous activity.

Description: SCP-4957 is a male tiger of undetermined age that has undergone a complete transformation into a humanoid form resembling a male human. Its height is approximately 1.8 meters and it weighs approximately 180 kilograms. SCP-4957 has green hair in a purple cap, wears horned rim glasses, and commonly wears a red scarf. It also wears a jade earring and carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-4957's most prominent facial feature is its frightened mouth, which gives it a constant appearance of agitation and terror. Despite this, SCP-4957 possesses an incredibly energetic and enthusiastic personality, often going to great lengths to excite others about various topics it feels passionately about. This can lead to comical situations where SCP-4957 becomes notably overexcited about a topic that others may not find as interesting.

SCP-4957's political career is documented extensively, and there is strong evidence to suggest that it has used its abilities to manipulate and influence multiple political events. Due to its position in society and the danger it poses as an anomalous being, it is considered a high-level containment priority.

Addendum: Due to SCP-4957's propensity for excitement, researchers have theorized the possibility that it might have anomalous abilities that influence the emotions of those around it. Further study is required to confirm this suspicion.
