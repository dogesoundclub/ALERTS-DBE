SCP Foundation Description:

Identification number 1078 is a humanoid entity classified under the species "human" but with a peculiar appearance that defies biological perceptions. This entity presents itself as a female, with a head reminiscent of a pink rabbit and red clown eyes that stand out in the dark, perfectly reflecting its unpredictable and extravagant personality. 

The entity is known to work as a banker, although their achievements and work ethic are questionable. Their tendency to act on their emotions rather than thinking things through often brings them to making startling and unorthodox decisions, manifesting a certain level of impulsive behavior. 

Anomalously, the entity possesses a two-color band feature on its forehead, and jade earrings on its long, pink rabbit ear that seem to have no biological classification. Furthermore, the entity is often seen with a cigarette on their person, which could prove hazardous when in the vicinity of other organic beings. 

It is advised to approach entity 1078 with caution, as their erratic personality and actions could cause unexpected but potentially dangerous situations. The Foundation is currently monitoring the entity to ensure the safety of the general public.
