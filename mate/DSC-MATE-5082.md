Addendum: Incident Log 5082-1

On █/██/20██, DSC-MATE-5082's gas mask malfunctioned, causing it to enter a state of distress. Despite attempts by Foundation personnel to calm DSC-MATE-5082, it became increasingly panicked and distraught. Eventually, DSC-MATE-5082 removed the gas mask, revealing a second face beneath it.

The second face was identified as belonging to a human male, whose identity remains unknown. The man was unresponsive and appeared to be in a comatose state. DSC-MATE-5082 was immediately sedated and the man was removed from the mask.

Further investigation revealed that the man was connected to DSC-MATE-5082 through a series of anomalous neural linkages. It is currently unknown how this connection was established or what its purpose was.

DSC-MATE-5082 has since refused to wear the gas mask and has expressed a desire to have the second face removed. Further testing is ongoing to determine the nature of DSC-MATE-5082's anomaly and any potential risks it may pose.
