Item #: 9807

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9807 is to be allowed full freedom of movement, but is to remain under constant surveillance at all times. Subject is currently employed as a veterinarian at a local animal clinic and is to continue normal operations as long as his activities do not deviate from standard procedures. Communication with subject is to be monitored at all times.

Description: Subject 9807, a human male, is notable for his distinctive appearance which includes a doge hat and a gold earring. Subject's eyes are obscured by normal prescription glasses, and the mouth area is consistently covered by a medical mask. Despite his somewhat comical attire, 9807 is known for his exceptional empathy skills, often able to intuitively identify and respond to the emotional states of those around him. This ability can lead to positive outcomes, but may also compromise containment efforts as individuals may be more prone to opening up to 9807 and revealing classified information.

Personality: Subject's strong empathic abilities have proven extremely helpful in coping with the various stresses and anxieties present in the animal clinic environment. His approachable and friendly demeanor puts both patients and clients at ease, and he has been known to act as a mediator during conflicts between staff members. Despite his near-constant use of his mask, 9807 is an effective communicator, often using humor to defuse tense situations or brighten someone's day. However, containment personnel must remain vigilant, as 9807's kindness may lead to a breach of confidential information or inappropriate emotional attachments. 

Overall, it is recommended that subject 9807's empathic abilities be monitored and, if necessary, modified to prevent potential containment breaches.
