Item #: SCP-4326

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-4326 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Communication with SCP-4326 should be kept at a minimum and only authorized personnel are allowed to interact with it. SCP-4326's workplace, the ██████ Theater, is currently under Foundation observation and all who interact with SCP-4326 must be monitored for any anomalous behavior.

Description:

SCP-4326 is a human male of average height and build with normal blonde hair. The subject is 36 years old and works as a theater manager. SCP-4326's most noticeable facial features are an unusual spot on the left side of the mouth and a constant frightened expression on the mouth. SCP-4326 retains a green-colored goggle on its forehead, a gold earring in each ear, and often wears a medical mask over its mouth. Additional accessories include a thick gold chain worn around its neck.

SCP-4326 exhibits an atypical personality, often designated as a natural brainstormer, and frequently comes up with inventive ideas. This compulsion to think creatively can result in situations of humor, especially as SCP-4326 often proposes non-sensical solutions to problems to gauge other's reactions.

SCP-4326 is in possession of no anomalous abilities that have been detected. Testing has shown that SCP-4326 is physically and mentally identical to any other human of its physical stature and age.

Addendum:

SCP-4326 is currently put under surveillance as its role as a manager of the ██████ Theater could expose the public to anomalies. Any events related to SCP-4326 must be reported, and all interaction with SCP-4326 should take place within the confines of containment.
