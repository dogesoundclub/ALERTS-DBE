Item #: DSC-MATE-9425

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9425 (codenamed "Spotty") is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. No fewer than two armed security personnel are to be stationed outside the cell at all times, with authorization to use lethal force if necessary. DSC-MATE-9425 is not to be allowed any access to plants or appliances of any kind, and is not permitted to name or converse with any living or non-living entities.

Description: DSC-MATE-9425 is a human male of indeterminate age, measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 85 kilograms. DSC-MATE-9425 is notable for the numerous brown spots on his face and hands, and for his constant smile, which appears to be involuntary. DSC-MATE-9425's eyes are covered by a pair of ski goggles at all times, and he wears a pink cap on his head, parting on the left side. DSC-MATE-9425 sports a gold earring in his left ear, and is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-9425's anomalous properties manifest in his tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects. This includes giving them names, conversing with them, and attributing human-like emotions and qualities to them. DSC-MATE-9425 claims to have formed close bonds with his car, his houseplants, and even his kitchen appliances. This behavior appears to be unrelated to any known psychological disorder, and DSC-MATE-9425 appears to be otherwise mentally stable.

Addendum: Investigation into DSC-MATE-9425's past revealed that he worked as a delivery driver for several years prior to containment. It is possible that his exposure to a wide variety of objects and settings may have triggered his anomalous behavior. Further research is ongoing.
