Item #: DSC-MATE-4139

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4139 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Its LED gas mask is to be kept in a separate locked containment locker when not in use during testing. No food with strong scents or flavors is to be given to DSC-MATE-4139, as it has the ability to detect and identify any toxins present in its food. Any personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-4139 must undergo regular psychological evaluations to ensure they are not affected by its anomalous properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-4139 is a human male of unknown age, standing at 178cm tall and 65kg in weight. Its most notable feature are the orange stripes covering its face, which appear to have been painted on. In addition, DSC-MATE-4139 wears a monk's hood and a gold earring on its left ear. Its eyes are obscured by nerd glasses, and its mouth is always in a frightened expression.

DSC-MATE-4139 has demonstrated the ability to detect and identify any toxins or harmful chemicals present in its food. It is also capable of neutralizing these toxins through an unknown process. Testing has shown that DSC-MATE-4139's digestive system does not follow normal patterns, leading to its anomalous abilities.

DSC-MATE-4139 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking its role as a fast food worker very seriously. However, it also possesses a playful and humorous side, frequently entertaining its coworkers with songs or dance routines during lulls in business. It appears to enjoy making others happy, despite its own abnormal circumstances.

Addendum 4139-A: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4139 inadvertently exposed a coworker to its anomalous properties after sharing a meal with them. The coworker reported feeling a tingling sensation in their mouth and throat before suddenly losing consciousness. DSC-MATE-4139 quickly administered first aid before medical personnel arrived on site. Further investigation revealed that the coworker had consumed several toxins earlier in the day, all of which were found to be absent from their system after DSC-MATE-4139's intervention. DSC-MATE-4139 has since been isolated from all non-essential personnel.
