Item #: 3868

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3868 is to be kept in a secure personnel locker when not on duty. It is allowed to roam freely within the Site, but is forbidden from leaving the premises without clearance from higher authority. Any deviation from this protocol is to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-3868 is a human male of average height and build, with a striking appearance consisting of orange stripes adorning his face and pink hair that parts at the center. His most notable facial feature is a mouth that conveys a perpetual expression of terror. SCP-3868 bears distinct, vivid red eyes reminiscent of clown makeup, which appear to be of a biological nature.  

He often adorns himself with green cross earrings, silver chains, and carries a candy stick at all times. Despite his bewildering appearance, SCP-3868 appears to be a well-fitting security personnel member, and his keen attention to detail makes him quite proficient at his job. His fastidiousness can sometimes become obsessive, with an inclination towards alphabetizing his spice rack, or sorting his wardrobe by color. While he possesses no anomalous traits or abilities, SCP-3868 should still be treated with caution due to his tendency to be fearful and anxious, which can sometimes negatively affect his judgement.

SCP-3868 demonstrates a preference for a lifestyle with predictable routines and orderliness, which fits well with his day-to-day job requirements. Socially, he tends to keep a low profile and does not engage in small talk or personal entertainment with other SCP personnel. SCP-3868 also prefers to keep to himself, which helps to avoid any accidental triggers that would cause an emotional reaction. 

Addendum: During a recent breach occurring at site-██, SCP-3868 proven to be an effective asset, employing his natural and weapon knowledge to help thwart the attempted escape of several dangerous SCPs. Upon completing the mission, SCP-3868 requested additional training to enhance his physical capabilities in the event of a future breach. Such actions demonstrate SCP-3868's commitment to the Secure Containment Procedures and the role of maintaining personnel safety.
