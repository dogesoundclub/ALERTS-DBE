Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8826 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of distress or anxiety. As a tiger of unknown origin, SCP-8826 is to be held in a standard containment unit equipped with necessary facilities for its care, including a large enough space for movement and exercise. Any contact with SCP-8826 is to be conducted with extreme caution, as they have been known to display unpredictable behavior when feeling threatened or stressed.

Description: SCP-8826 is a male tiger of indeterminate age, with green hair worn in a purple cap and red cross earrings on each ear. They often wear nerd glasses and a medical mask, which serves to conceal what appears to be a permanently frightened mouth. Although their physical appearance can be intimidating, SCP-8826 displays a docile disposition when calm and collected.

Personality: SCP-8826 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and compassion, often taking on the problems of others as their own. Their belief that they are responsible for fixing everything around them is both a helpful trait in their job as a reporter and a potential liability in their daily life. Despite their tendency to take on too much, SCP-8826 remains determined to help others in any way they can.

Addendum: SCP-8826's exceptional writing ability has given them a reputation in the journalism industry, earning them accolades and awards for their investigative work in the field. Given their unique species, SCP-8826 has become a celebrity of sorts, appearing on talk shows and hosting their own popular news segment. Any potential breach of SCP-8826's containment should be reported immediately to the Site Director.
