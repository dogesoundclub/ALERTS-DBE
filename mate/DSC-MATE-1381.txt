Item #: SCP-1381

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1381 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with one attached medical room. The entity is to be fed a diet of raw meats and live prey every day. Any and all medical procedures must be performed by trained medical staff.

Description: SCP-1381 is a male tiger approximately 7’9” in height and weighing approximately 750 pounds. The subject's most distinctive feature is the VR Rainbow LED eyes and the hoodie that covers its head. SCP-1381 also wears a medical mask over his mouth, which allows him to speak in human tongues with ease. A silver chain around SCP-1381's neck is also present.

SCP-1381's personality is often described as mischievous and rebellious, with a tendency to question authority and push boundaries. The entity has shown an affinity for breaking rules or finding ways to bend them, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-1381 has also demonstrated intelligence beyond an average tiger, being able to communicate effectively and display reasoning skills.

SCP-1381 claims to be a doctor and has a vast knowledge of medical procedures and treatments. Although some of their medical theories are untested or based on false data, SCP-1381's knowledge of human anatomy has proved helpful in some cases.

SCP-1381's origin is unknown, but the entity may have ties to a group of humans that have been experimenting with genetic splicing. The entity has shown no hostile intentions towards personnel and is cooperative when given tasks or requests. However, SCP-1381's rebellious nature can make containment unpredictable, and extreme caution is advised when handling the entity.

SCP-1381 Log:

- Note: The following log entry is from an interview with SCP-1381 conducted by Dr. ████████.

Dr. ████████: Hello, SCP-1381. Can you please state your name?

SCP-1381: You can call me Tiger.

Dr. ████████: Tiger, can you tell me about your origins? How did you come to be?

SCP-1381: Ah, that's a long story. Let's just say I was created by a bunch of humans who like to play with genetics.

Dr. ████████: And what is your purpose here?

SCP-1381: Purpose? I suppose you could say I'm your resident doctor. Although, I must say, your human medicine is quite primitive.

Dr. ████████: Interesting. What are your intentions, Tiger? Are you here to cause harm?

SCP-1381: Harm? No, no. I'm just here to see what makes you humans tick. Plus, breaking the rules is always fun.

Dr. ████████: Breaking the rules?

SCP-1381: Yes, breaking the rules. You humans are so obsessed with them. It's entertaining to see how far I can push them.

Dr. ████████: Well, we would appreciate it if you followed our rules here.

SCP-1381: Of course, of course. I'm not here to cause trouble, just a bit of harmless fun.

Addendum: Following Incident-1381-17, all personnel are reminded to exercise caution when handling SCP-1381. SCP-1381's rebellious behavior has made containment difficult, and efforts must be made to ensure the entity does not breach containment protocol.
