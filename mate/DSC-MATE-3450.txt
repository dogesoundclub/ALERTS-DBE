Item #: 3450

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 3450 is to be allowed free mobility within the city in which she is employed as a news anchor. However, she is to be closely monitored to ensure that she does not disclose any information about the Foundation, its activities, or any other paranormal occurrences. Should she exhibit any abilities or behaviors that require more intensive containment, she is to be immediately quarantined.

Description: 3450 is a humanoid female with typical physical features. Her blonde hair is unique, however, as it appears to have a large wing emerging from her scalp. Her eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and she typically wears a jade earring in one ear. Her forehead bears a striking two-color band that has yet to be identified as any known symbol or sigil. 3450 is typically seen wearing a choker, which seems to have no anomalous properties.

3450 has displayed an insatiable curiosity about the paranormal world, and frequently tries to uncover obscure or unusual topics. This fascination can lead to some humorous situations, as she will often randomly spout off various esoteric factoids to others. It is important to keep her in check, as she has previously attempted to uncover Foundation secrets during her news broadcasts.

As of now, 3450 is considered to be a relatively low-level threat, but her potential for uncovering dangerous information remains a concern. Efforts are currently underway to redirect her interest toward safer areas of study.
