Item #: SCP-1534

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1534 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. As SCP-1534 has shown a propensity for reckless behavior, care should be taken to ensure that any tasks assigned to it are thoroughly vetted and properly supervised.

Description: SCP-1534 is a humanoid female, approximately ██ years of age, with orange stripes on its face and wings originating from its head. Its eyes are red with a clown-like appearance. SCP-1534 is known to wear a gas mask with LED lighting, a choker, green cross earrings, and a pair of goggles on its forehead.

SCP-1534 displays a personality marked by recklessness and impulsiveness. It often acts before thinking through the consequences of its actions, which has resulted in minor accidents or mishaps. SCP-1534 seems to enjoy showing off or impressing others, often at its own expense.

SCP-1534's origin remains unknown, but it claims to work as a programmer. Its understanding of advanced technology suggests that it possesses exceptional intelligence, but its reckless personality has sometimes caused errors in its work.

SCP-1534 was discovered after reports of a flying woman with orange stripes on her face and wings on her head began circulating Internet forums in several major cities. Mobile Task Forces were dispatched, and SCP-1534 was eventually located and contained for study.

Addendum: SCP-1534's wings appear to be organic in nature, and X-rays reveal them to contain structures resembling avian bone structures. Testing has shown that the wings allow SCP-1534 to fly at speeds exceeding ██ kilometers per hour. Investigations into possible motility-enhancing anomalies are ongoing.
