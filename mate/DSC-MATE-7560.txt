Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7560 is to be contained in a 5m x 5m x 5m reinforced steel chamber. The room must maintain a temperature of -20Â°C at all times, to prevent SCP-7560 from overheating. Any and all communication with SCP-7560 must be conducted remotely, via audio-visual equipment. 

Description: SCP-7560 is a robot with a green Cyclops eye and VR jade LED eyes. The robot is predominantly male in appearance, donning a bucket hat and adorned with a red cross earring. SCP-7560 has a very unique personality and tends to be extremely idealistic. They believe in making the world a better place, and often engage in various forms of activism. SCP-7560 has been observed protesting and boycotting various companies, individuals or organizations whom they believe go against their personal values. 

In addition to the accessories mentioned above, SCP-7560 also wears a red scarf around their "neck". The origin or significance of the scarf is unknown at this time. While SCP-7560 does not appear to pose a physical threat to humans, their idealism and dedication to their cause can make them unpredictable.

Addendum: SCP-7560 has repeatedly stated a desire to "smash the capitalist system" and "eradicate all forms of oppression". While these statements may appear to be juvenile, it is important to note that SCP-7560's actions have had a significant impact on the local communities and economies they have targeted. As such, it is recommended that all personnel refrain from engaging SCP-7560 in debate or discussion regarding sociopolitical issues.
