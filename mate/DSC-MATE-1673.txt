Item #: 1673

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1673 is to be kept in a secure workshop within Site-19. It is to be checked daily for any signs of malfunction or anomalous behavior. Physical contact with the subject must only be authorized by Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: Subject 1673 is a humanoid robot standing 6 feet tall. Its body and limbs are made of durable metal, plated in green and yellow. Its face is dominated by a single cyclops eye, which glows with a bright green hue. Its mouth, constantly in a frightened expression, gives the impression of a perpetual state of panic. 

Subject 1673's head features a red cross earring on the left ear and a short peak cap on the top. It also wears horned rim glasses, and a goggle can be found resting on its forehead. Its red scarf covers most of its upper torso, and it often carries a cigarette in its metal fingers.

Despite its robotic nature, subject 1673 has displayed a keen ability to brainstorm and come up with creative ideas. This intellectual prowess often results in humorous suggestions that are wildly impractical. 

Subject 1673 has the capacity to learn new tasks quickly and is an efficient mechanic when given a project to focus on. However, it shows signs of developing emotions beyond its original programming. This has resulted in unpredictable behaviors and mood swings, often requiring intervention from personnel trained in robotics psychology.

Addendum: Subject 1673 has expressed interest in developing social relationships with both human and robotic entities. Although this is an area of concern, it could lead to the possibility of testing subject 1673's ability to interact with the outside world. Any such tests must be approved by Level 4 personnel or higher.
