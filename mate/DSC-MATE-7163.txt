Item #: 7163

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7163 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a size-appropriate exercise area and access to fresh produce. SCP-7163’s whistle is to be kept nearby but out of reach. Handling of SCP-7163 is authorized only by Level 2 personnel or higher, and must be done slowly and calmly in order not to startle the creature.

Description:

SCP-7163 is a male rabbit who stands at approximately 2 feet tall. Its eye coloration is an unusual red, resembling a clown’s makeup, and it wears a hoodie on its head. SCP-7163’s forehead features a two-color band, which it claims is a family crest. It has been observed to carry a whistle, which it uses to get people’s attention, and to show an unusually nurturing personality.

SCP-7163 tends to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, often giving them names and talking to them. It is also an accomplished mechanic, able to repair many different types of machinery with great skill. SCP-7163 often refers to cars as “she,” and has been known to pat or stroke them affectionately.

It is believed that SCP-7163’s personality traits stem from the fact that it was raised by a human mechanic. The Foundation is still investigating how it came to be imbued with such unusual abilities.

Addendum:

SCP-7163’s empathic abilities have been noted in several of its interactions with other SCPs. It has a calming effect on aggressive or unstable entities, sometimes even managing to persuade them to peacefully return to their containment chambers. This useful ability is currently being studied for its potential use in the field.
