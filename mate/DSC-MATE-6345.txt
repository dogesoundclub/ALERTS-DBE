Item #: SCP-6345

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6345 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with a minimum of two security personnel stationed outside the door at all times. Any attempts by SCP-6345 to communicate with or influence security personnel should be immediately reported to the Site Director. No civilian contact is to be allowed with SCP-6345.

Description: SCP-6345 is a female human of average build and height with distinct facial features, including purple lips and normal eyeglasses. SCP-6345's head is dyed orange on one side, with a unique green cross earring implanted in each ear. SCP-6345 regularly wears a choker as her primary attachment.

SCP-6345 is a professional beautician and enjoys getting others excited about her work. SCP-6345's personality is characterized by high levels of enthusiasm, energy, and a desire to share her passions with others; however, this also has the potential to cause humorous misunderstandings and confusion for those around her.

SCP-6345's anomalous properties manifest during periods of intense excitement or enthusiasm, leading to unpredictable abilities and effects. These abilities have included the spontaneous transformation of plants and animals to new forms, causing temporarily altered states of reality, and creating extraplanar portals to unknown locations. SCP-6345's abilities have yet to be fully understood, but they are believed to be spontaneously activated by the emotional state of SCP-6345.

Addendum: SCP-6345 was initially discovered following reports of unusual phenomena within a beauty salon in ██████, New York. Upon investigation, the Foundation discovered SCP-6345's abilities and promptly contained her for study. Due to the potentially dangerous nature of SCP-6345's abilities, all further testing and study should be approved by the Site Director.
