ITEM #: 9301

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9301 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell at all times. Any interaction with subject 9301 is to be supervised by at least two level 2 personnel with a background in psychology. Medical masks must be worn by all personnel during interactions with subject 9301 to avoid potential effects of the subject's unique facial features.

Description: Subject 9301 appears to be a humanoid female of unknown origin. The subject's most notable feature is a set of red clown eyes, which are believed to be the result of an unknown genetic anomaly. The subject also has a distinctive purple lip, a two-color band on their forehead, and a jade earring in each ear. The subject often wears a medical mask to conceal their face, despite it being a side effect of their anomalous traits rather than a medical necessity.

Subject 9301 is known for their exceptional charisma and ability to connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can lead to humorous situations, where the subject can get complete strangers to open up about their life stories or share funny anecdotes, bringing people closer together. However, this ability may have adverse effects on personnel who interact with subject 9301 for prolonged periods.

Addendum 9301-A: Subject 9301 was initially found during a routine security check at a nightclub, where they were working as a security guard. Upon inspection of their identification and genetic testing, it was discovered that the subject had no recorded family or identification beyond a single ID card in their possession. Further questioning revealed little information about the subject's past, other than their time spent working various jobs within the service industry. 

Addendum 9301-B: Due to the subject's unique abilities, they have been approved for some limited use in Informational and Negation Division operations. However, all use of subject 9301 must be approved on a case-by-case basis by at least Level 3 personnel.
