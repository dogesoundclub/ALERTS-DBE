Item #: 3467

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #3467 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell is to be equipped with an exercise area containing a variety of climbing structures and a tire swing. A daily schedule should be given to Item #3467 to satisfy their strong sense of responsibility and duty.

Description: Item #3467 is a male primate with a doge hat on its head and horn-rimmed glasses covering its eyes. It wears a jade earring in its left ear, a gold chain around its neck, and it is often seen holding a cigarette. Despite its humanoid appearance, Item #3467 is, in fact, a monkey.

Personality-wise, Item #3467 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. It tends to take on more than it can handle, leading to humorous situations where it attempts to accomplish too much or carries too many things at once. Due to its love of organizing and scheduling, Item #3467 is currently employed as a theater manager.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Item #3467 was discovered by Foundation personnel after a series of reports of a monkey running a successful local theater. After subduing and containing Item #3467, the Foundation deemed it more practical to allow it to continue managing the theater. Despite possessing no anomalous abilities, Item #3467 has managed to attract a large and dedicated audience to the theater. Further research is needed to determine why.
