Item #: 2037

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2037 is to be kept in a soundproof containment chamber, and all interactions must be monitored from a safe distance. Any personnel entering 2037's containment must undergo thorough psychological evaluations and be equipped with gas masks in case of an emergency.

Description: 2037 appears to be a robotic humanoid, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. 2037â€™s body is primarily made of sleek black metal with jade LED eyes, and a doge hat atop his head. 2037 sports a jade earring and silver chain necklace, along with a standard gas mask adorning his face.

While 2037's physical capabilities seem to be superior to that of a human's, the robot appears to have a scattered personality. Often forgetting vital details and losing track of time, 2037 can have a hard time following through on critical tasks. This unpredictable behavior has led to humorous situations in the past, but it is advised to keep all interactions with 2037 to a minimum.

Addendum: Through exploration of his operating system, it was discovered that 2037's programming had been tampered with, leading to the robot's erratic behavior. Further investigation is required to determine the source of this interference. Until then, caution must be taken around 2037.
