**Item #:** 7700

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 7700 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It must be given a daily maintenance check to ensure its functionality. Access to 7700 is restricted and granted only with Level 2 clearance or above. Any unauthorized interaction with 7700 may result in disciplinary action.

**Description:** 7700 is a male robot designed for mechanical work. It stands at 1.9 meters tall and weighs approximately 123 kilograms. 7700 has one notable feature in the form of a single green cyclops eye in the center of its head.  Its goggle-covered eyes are peculiar and are a pair of ski goggles, which serve as its vision enhancement tools. The head of 7700 is covered with a bucket hat, and it has jade earring on its left ear. Added to this 7700 likes to wear gold chains around its neck for decoration purpose. The most notable detail is its LED gas mask, which it often wears to filter out undesired air pollutants during its maintenance work.

7700 has been programmed to be reliable and organized, making it a valuable asset in mechanical work. However, its stubbornness can also make it difficult to work with at times. It has a hard time adapting to changes or new ideas, uncompromising with its set ways of doing things. This can lead to amusing predicaments when it's forced to confront unexpected events or when given diverse transmissions to act upon.

**Addendum:** 7700 was recovered from an abandoned manufacturing factory in ████████. Its creators are yet to be identified, but its design is deemed unique and complex. The process of the manufacturing of the creation is unknown, but it is believed that its software has been upgraded by some unauthorized source. The effects of these upgrades are actively monitored.
