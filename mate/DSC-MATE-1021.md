Item #: 1021

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1021 is to be kept under standard human housing security in urban areas. The subject is to be monitored to ensure that she does not forget any important appointments, or wander off into potentially dangerous situations. The medical mask must be worn and treated according to local personal protective equipment guidelines when performing bodily or cosmetic treatments.

Description: Item 1021 is a human female of indeterminate age with an obsidian skin tone. What stands out is her appearance: purple lips, embedded with cybernetic VR Jade LED eyes, and a gray and black sheen bucket hat. She is a practicing beautician and displays a great deal of interest and skill in her craft, although her scatterbrained nature can lead to hilarious yet unfortunate cosmetic mistakes.

The subject's use of cybernetic eyes renders her more difficult to locate and track via traditional CCTV systems, and has resulted in her accidental loss when moving from her bedroom.

While her affable nature means that she makes quick acquaintances, her air-headedness could lead to severe dangers if she does not remain under proper monitoring. This subject should be approached with caution, due to the unpredictability of their actions.

Addendum: Item 1021 once fell asleep during a hair perm, setting fire to the client's scalp. Proper fire safety practices should be observed at all times.
