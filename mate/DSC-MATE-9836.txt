SCP-9836, also known as the "Greenhead Programmer," is a male human specimen with a distinctive set of green layers covering its head. Its face features are marked by several spots, mostly on its cheeks and forehead, which seem to vary in shape and coloration over time.

SCP-9836 works as a programmer, spending most of its time in front of computer screens, typing away codes in a seemingly endless stream of binary language. Due to its work environment, SCP-9836 always wears a medical mask over its mouth, presumably to avoid breathing in harmful particles.

In addition, SCP-9836 is often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck, which it claims to be a good luck charm against malicious computer viruses.

Despite its reserved personality, SCP-9836 is known for its nurturing and caring demeanor towards others. It often goes out of its way to help friends and family members, treating them as if they were its own children. In some instances, this behavior has led to humorous situations, such as SCP-9836 tucking in its friends at night or cooking them home-style meals.

Researchers are still uncertain about the origin and purpose of SCP-9836's green layers and spots, but it remains under observation at Site-██ for further study.
