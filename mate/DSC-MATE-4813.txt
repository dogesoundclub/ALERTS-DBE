SCP-4813 is a peculiar entity classified as a mafia boss of unknown origin, identified by a set of unique traits that make him stand out in his industry. SCP-4813 displays a striking, artificially illuminated pair of eyes with multiple colors, resembling a virtual reality rainbow installation, which could potentially affect the subject's perception of it.  
Moreover, SCP-4813 is recognized by its frightened mouth, often appearing overwhelmed or uneasy in intense situations. It's notable that, despite its physical appearance, SCP-4813 is particularly persuasive, charming, and charismatic, often leading his underworld associates with ease, despite being smaller in size compared to other mob bosses.  
To underline its position of power, SCP-4813 often wears a gold chain, similar to a classic gangster, and carries a cigarette, used as a natural extension of his authority. SCP-4813's personality appears outgoing and extroverted, displaying an inclination towards entertaining and enjoying good company. However, it's critical to note that his cheerful personality doesn't implicate a lack of ruthlessness in executing his duties as a mafia boss. As always with SCPs, caution is recommended when approaching it, as SCP-4813's charisma might lead to unintended consequences.
