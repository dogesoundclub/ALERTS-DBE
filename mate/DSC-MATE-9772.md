DSC-MATE-9772 is a highly unique specimen of the Oryctolagus cuniculus strain, also known as a domesticated Rabbit. Despite its commonplace animal classification, this rabbit displays several anomalous properties and peculiar characteristics. Its blue clown eyes provide a striking appearance, coupled with a purple cap adorned with a headset; DSC-MATE-9772 is undoubtedly an unusual sight to behold.

Furthermore, the Jade earring that dangles from its left ear and the Gold chain around its neck suggests that DSC-MATE-9772 may have a fascination with jewelry or luxury items typically reserved for humans. Notably, the rabbit carries an unlit cigarette in its mouth, often gripping it between its teeth with apparent satisfaction.

The creature exhibits a distinct personality trait that could be classified as rebellious or strong-willed. DSC-MATE-9772 is independent and intends to maintain its freedom, often displaying disobedience or defiance against authority or restrictions that it deems unnecessary. This character is prone to engaging in clandestine activities such as sneaking out of a workplace or taking leave without proper approval.

It is imperative to note that DSC-MATE-9772 is as intelligent as it is stubborn. This artifact is capable of nonverbal communication through its expressive eyes and body signals, making it an interesting and unique research subject for DogeSoundClub agents.
