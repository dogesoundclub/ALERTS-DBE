Item #: SCP-1137

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1137 is to be employed as a police officer in the city of [REDACTED]. SCP-1137 is not to be allowed in contact with any civilians outside of official police business. Under no circumstances is SCP-1137 to be given any assignments involving gift-giving or ceremonial duties.

Description: SCP-1137 appears to be a Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), standing approximately 2 meters tall on all fours. The eyes of SCP-1137 are blue, and possess the unusual characteristic of being similar in appearance to a clown's eyes. SCP-1137's head is adorned with a Doge hat, and a red victory band is visible on its forehead. In addition, SCP-1137 wears a gold chain around its neck and is rarely seen without a candy stick in its mouth.

SCP-1137's personality is noteworthy in that it is highly observant and attentive to details, making it well-suited for police work. However, SCP-1137 displays a notable flaw in the form of an obsession with gift-giving. SCP-1137 will expend considerable effort in order to determine the "perfect" gift for any given recipient, often to the point of distraction from its duties.

Addendum 1137-A: SCP-1137 was brought to Foundation attention following a string of suspicious gift-related activities within the city of [REDACTED]. Upon capture, SCP-1137 expressed surprise that its activities were considered "out of the ordinary," and insisted that it was simply "doing its job." Interviews with SCP-1137 suggest that it developed its obsession with gift-giving as a means of gaining the trust and respect of the community it serves.

Addendum 1137-B: SCP-1137's gift-giving tendencies have been observed to dissipate over time, with prolonged periods of duty resulting in a decreased focus on gift-giving activities. It is currently theorized that SCP-1137's gift-giving tendencies may be tied to a subconscious desire to be acknowledged as a valuable member of its community. Further study is required to confirm this hypothesis.
