Item #: DSC-MATE-4435

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4435 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. All interactions with DSC-MATE-4435 must be conducted with caution due to its unpredictable behavior. Personnel should refrain from engaging in high-risk activities with DSC-MATE-4435, as they are known to take unnecessary risks when not under supervision.

Description: DSC-MATE-4435 appears to be a human female in her late 20s to early 30s, and the identity of the individual has been confirmed as [REDACTED]. DSC-MATE-4435's most notable physical characteristic is the orange stripes on her face, which are believed to be a result of unknown anomalous effects. DSC-MATE-4435's hair is blonde and is typically worn in a ushanka hat. Additionally, DSC-MATE-4435 wears normal glasses and has a two-color band on her forehead, which is also believed to be a byproduct of anomalous effects.

DSC-MATE-4435 is generally friendly and likable, though it exhibits a tendency to be unpredictable and impulsive. DSC-MATE-4435 often takes risks and behaves on a whim, which has led to several humorous situations during previous interactions with Foundation personnel. For example, DSC-MATE-4435 has been known to jump off cliffs into lakes or rivers with little consideration for the potential consequences.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4435 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of anomalous behavior were discovered by local authorities. [REDACTED] was identified as the source of the reports, and the Foundation was contacted to investigate the situation. Upon further investigation, it was determined that DSC-MATE-4435 was exhibiting anomalous effects and was subsequently contained. Further research is ongoing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-4435's anomalous properties.
