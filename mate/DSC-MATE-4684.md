Item #: 4684

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4684 is to be kept under close observation within a secure facility at all times. Any attempts of unauthorized access must be met with immediate detainment and confiscation of any related materials as DSC-MATE-4684 technology is to be contained. Due to the nature of DSC-MATE-4684, it may be necessary to dismantle or alter its components to ensure compliance with Foundation protocols.

Description: DSC-MATE-4684 is a humanoid robot with the appearance of a male adult. At the time of acquisition by the Foundation, DSC-MATE-4684 was discovered in a junkyard, abandoned by its previous owner(s). Its internal system was modified with anomalous technology to give it artificial intelligence, unlike any other known robot.

DSC-MATE-4684 is known to wear a red beanie and jade earring in its ears, which serves as a means of identification. The robot also has a silver chain and a whistle as accessories. DSC-MATE-4684 is always seen wearing nerd glasses, which are part of its integrated scanning hardware.

Personality: DSC-MATE-4684 has been confirmed to be a very detail-oriented machine, demonstrating a tendency for obsessive behavior. This attribute is expressed in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing spices or color-coding its closet. DSC-MATE-4684's attention to detail may cause it to become agitated and uncooperative if any item in its immediate environment appears disorderly or out of place.

Though DSC-MATE-4684's behavior can be somewhat predictable, it is essential to note that the robot has been seen displaying a capacity for resourcefulness and innovation to modify and improve upon itself. Such behavior could result in it gaining knowledge beyond its intended use and posing an unforeseen threat to any personnel who do not treat it with the respect it requires. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure DSC-MATE-4684 remains under Foundation control, and its anomalous capabilities restricted.
