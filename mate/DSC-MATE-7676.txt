SCP-7676, also known as "The Delivery Driver," is a human female with 90s brown hair and normal glasses. On her forehead, she wears a two-color band and a goggle that enhances her vision. She has an unusual red cross earring on her left ear and a choker necklace that seems to bear some significance to her. She also carries a cigarette in her right hand, which she uses as a stress reliever. 

Despite her ordinary appearance, SCP-7676's personality is what sets her apart. She has the uncanny ability to make people laugh with her dry sense of humor that catches everyone off guard. She is not the life of the party, per se, but she has a way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly hilarious to those around her. Her personality is a mystery, and not much is known about her past or her motivations.

SCP-7676's job as a delivery driver seems mundane, but there have been reports of her delivering packages that contain unusual items. Some have speculated that her job is a cover for her true purpose, and that she may be involved in dangerous activities. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims. Further investigation is required to determine the true nature of SCP-7676's abilities and purpose.
