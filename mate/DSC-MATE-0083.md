Item #: 83

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 83 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be fitted with a sound system capable of playing gentle, comforting music continuously. Personnel interacting with Item 83 must wear earplugs to prevent hearing loss due to her loud voice. Item 83 is not allowed to handle sharp objects or chemicals without authorization from at least two senior staff members.

Description: Item 83 is a human female with orange stripes on her face and red clown eyes. She wears a purple cap with a headset, and a medical mask always covers her mouth. She has a red lip and a two-color band on her forehead. Her ears have gold earrings, and she wears a gold chain. Item 83 is a beautician by profession and has a nurturing personality. She frequently talks to inanimate objects, and her caring extends to them as well. Item 83 exhibits no anomalous behavior, but her tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects gives her a unique outlook on life.

Addendum: Item 83 was detained by the Foundation after several reports of unusual behavior were filed. The reports described Item 83 having conversations with a hairbrush, a vase, and a mirror. Upon rescue and containment, Item 83 displayed no signs of distress and seemed content to continue her conversations with her "friends." Despite her odd behavior, Item 83 has been cooperative and has not displayed any hostile actions towards personnel.
