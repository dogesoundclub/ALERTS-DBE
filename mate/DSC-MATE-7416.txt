Item #: SCP-7416

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7416 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber equipped with a monitoring system to detect any unauthorized use of electrical equipment. Access to SCP-7416's chamber is strictly limited to Level-2 personnel or higher, and any individuals wishing to enter the chamber must first be cleared by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7416 is a male rabbit, standing 50 cm tall on their hind legs, with red clown eyes and a permanent frightened expression on their mouth. SCP-7416's head is covered with green hair and a purple cap, featuring a 2-color band on their forehead. SCP-7416 is always seen wearing a red scarf and a whistle around their neck.

SCP-7416 is able to manipulate electrical energy to an unknown extent, making them a valuable asset to the Foundation when it comes to repairing or disabling electrical equipment. SCP-7416 claims to work as an electrician in the outside world, though there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

SCP-7416's personality is described as impulsive and prone to acting on their emotions without thinking things through first. While this can lead to humorous situations, it can also present a danger to themselves and others. SCP-7416 has a strong sense of justice and believes in protecting those who cannot protect themselves.

Addendum 7416-01: After a containment breach resulting in SCP-7416's escape, Foundation agents were able to track down and retrieve SCP-7416 using their whistle as a lure. SCP-7416 apologized for their behavior and expressed remorse for causing a breach. Further testing is required to determine if SCP-7416 poses a continued threat to Foundation security.
