DSC-MATE-5750 is a gifted veterinarian and its abilities are vital for the Foundation's animal testing programs. However, DSC-MATE-5750's personality can be concerning. DSC-MATE-5750's gift-giving tendencies can lead to the development of excessive behavior where DSC-MATE-5750 becomes overly concerned with providing the “perfect” gift. This behavior can lead to DSC-MATE-5750 spending a disproportionate amount of time and resources on the matter. 

DSC-MATE-5750's behavior has led to several notices of concern. However, it has not displayed any hostile or harmful behavior to date. Foundation personnel are to monitor DSC-MATE-5750 closely and report any abnormal behavior immediately.
