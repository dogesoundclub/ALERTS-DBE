Item #: DSC-MATE-7123

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7123 is to reside within a standard humanoid containment unit within Site-██. They are to be provided with organic, vegetarian-based meals, and are to be allowed access to any relevant materials or equipment required for their farming job, pending approval from Level-3 personnel. Any attempts to protest or boycott any company or cause must be monitored, but not necessarily discouraged unless found to pose a security threat.

Description: DSC-MATE-7123 is a female human of approximately 40 years of age, with orange stripes on the left side of her face, and a purple lip. They wear normal glasses and a purple cap with a headset on their head, as well as a green cross earring. DSC-MATE-7123 wears a medical mask over their mouth, and is frequently seen with a gold chain around their neck.

DSC-MATE-7123's primary occupation is farming, and they exhibit no anomalous abilities in that regard. However, they tend to be very idealistic, with a strong desire to make the world a better place. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that they feel goes against their values. It is worth noting that DSC-MATE-7123 is not inherently hostile, but may become agitated if they feel their beliefs are being disrespected or ignored.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-7123 requested permission to use DSC-████ for agricultural purposes, citing their desire to create a sustainable and self-sufficient farm. This request was approved pending further study, and DSC-MATE-7123 has been observed to be much more content and cooperative since the introduction of DSC-████ into their routine. Further study into similar anomalous items for farming purposes is ongoing.
