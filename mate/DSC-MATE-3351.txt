Description: Subject 3351 is a male human of average height and build. The most notable feature of his appearance is the orange stripes that run across his face, giving him an almost feline appearance. He wears a bucket hat on his head and a red victory band across his forehead.

The subject's eyes are red, akin to those of a clown, and his mouth is almost always open in a state of perpetual fright. He wears a medical mask over his mouth, which has been observed to change in color and texture depending on his emotional state.

Subject 3351 is a reporter by profession and approaches his job with great diligence and responsibility. He has an almost obsessive sense of duty and is known to take on more than he can handle at times, resulting in some amusing situations.

Despite his quirks, Subject 3351 is not considered a threat to personnel or the general public. However, his unusual appearance and behavior warrant further study to better understand the nature of his condition.
