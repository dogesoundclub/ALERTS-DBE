Item #: SCP-3140

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3140 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Standard male tiger physical restraints are to be used to prevent any aggressive behaviour. Access to SCP-3140 is permitted for research purposes only under strict supervision. Delivery driver duties are to be simulated within the containment cell delivered in sealed and secured packages.

Description: SCP-3140 is a male Bengal tiger of average weight and size. SCP-3140 is distinguishable by their accessories, which include nerd glasses over their eyes, a blue bandana over their head, a silver chain, and a normal gas mask. SCP-3140 has also been known to wear a standard blue delivery uniform.

SCP-3140 possesses a strong and decisive personality which can come across as bossy or intimidating. The personality is an anomaly relating to the efficiency of the delivery process. The personality may change when not involved in delivery activities. It is unknown whether this is due to SCP-3140 adapting to different scenarios or if it is its true personality. 


SCP-3140 has the ability to smell packages which have been tampered with or altered. No testing to show whether this links to radical efficiency in delivery has been performed due to ethical considerations.

Addendum: "The Foundation has requested SCP-3140's assistance regarding some of our cargo. A test involving the transport of experimental Class A materials shall occur." 

Note: "Unauthorized access may result in an injury. Its bossy and intimidating behavior make it unsuitable for everyday research. SCP-3140's abilities as a delivery driver should be the main focus."
