Description: Subject 573 is a female human of average height and build with distinctive orange stripes on her face and bold red lips. The subject wears normal glasses over her deep-set eyes and has a head that appears to be made of metal, which may be why she works as a mechanic. She has an earring in the form of a red cross and wears a gold chain around her neck.

Subject 573's most intriguing quality is her tendency to be lost in thought, leading to humorous situations such as walking into poles or tripping over things while deep in introspection. Otherwise, her behavior is standard for a human-acting in rational ways and reacting to external stimuli in a manner that one would expect.

Addendum: Dr. ███████ has requested that the subject be allowed access to a personal computer and a drawing pad as a means of improving her mental state. The Site Director will review the request and make a final determination.
