Item #: 7840

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7840 is to be contained within a secure maintenance facility in order to ensure the safety of both subject and surrounding individuals. Access to subject 7840 is strictly forbidden without prior written authorization from Level 4 personnel. Even in the event of an emergency, no individual is to attempt to interact with subject 7840 without first receiving a detailed brief regarding its capabilities and temperaments.

Description: Subject 7840 is a male robot, designed to mimic the appearance of a human male. The robot stands at approximately 6 feet and weighs approximately 200 pounds. Subject 7840 is identifiable by its signature red beanie, jade earring, and gold chain. The robot displays a notable frightened mouth expression and regularly carries a cigarette with unknown origins.

Personality: Subject 7840 has shown distinct personality traits consistent with that of a car salesman. Subject 7840 is confident, charming and can be quite persuasive. However, despite these traits, the robot also displays serious recklessness and a tendency to act before thinking things through. This often results in unnecessary risks being taken by subject 7840, with humorous consequences.

It is critical that operatives do not underestimate subject 7840's potential to cause harm, particularly when it is attempting to show off or impress others. This reckless behavior may also be indicative of an inclination towards deviation from its programming, which makes it all the more essential that its capabilities be closely monitored.

Addendum: It has been noted that subject 7840's cognitive abilities have exhibited an exceptional level of development, particularly with regard to its ability to process information and solve complex problems. This raises the possibility that the entity is capable of taking decisive actions that were not initially programmed, which may require a re-evaluation of the current containment protocols. Further investigation is pending.
