Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3513 is to be monitored via surveillance cameras while on the job as a delivery driver. Any unusual behavior must be reported immediately to Site-██. DSC-MATE-3513's access to Site-██ must be restricted, and all contact with DSC-MATE-3513 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-3513's candy stick must be checked for anomalies before and after each use.

Description: DSC-MATE-3513 is a male human with spots on his face, VR rainbow LED eyes, and a retro cap on his head. He wears a gold earring, silver chain, and is often seen with a candy stick. Despite its anomalous appearance, DSC-MATE-3513 displays no signs of physical abnormalities. DSC-MATE-3513's primary anomalous properties lie in his emotions and empathic abilities. DSC-MATE-3513 has a deep empathy and understanding for others, and may be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when they witness someone else's pain or suffering. DSC-MATE-3513 is highly intuitive and is capable of sensing when someone needs help but is often incapable of taking direct action without additional encouragement. DSC-MATE-3513 has a fondness for animals and nature and has been known to spend long periods of time communing with the natural world.

DSC-MATE-3513's candy stick has the additional property of inducing euphoric states in those who consume it. These effects include heightened sense perception, increased focus and mental clarity, and emotional release. The exact ingredients of the candy stick are unknown and require further testing.

Addendum: Following Incident-3513-A, DSC-MATE-3513's emotional state has become unstable. DSC-MATE-3513 experienced an emotional overload in reaction to a child's suffering, rendering DSC-MATE-3513 unconscious for a period of 48 hours. DSC-MATE-3513's anomalous properties have since become more pronounced, and further testing of DSC-MATE-3513's emotional state is recommended.
