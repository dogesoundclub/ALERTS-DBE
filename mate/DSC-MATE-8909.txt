Item #: 8909

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8909 is to be monitored at all times via surveillance cameras and human observation. Attempts to engage or communicate with the subject are strictly forbidden. The subject must be kept at a safe distance from any and all banking institutions, as their presence has been known to cause instability in financial systems. Any attempts by the subject to access or tamper with banking records or assets are to be immediately reported to the appropriate authorities.

Description: Subject 8909 is a middle-aged human male, displaying orange stripes on their face and a perpetually frightened mouth. They possess blue clown eyes which are unsettling to witnesses. The subject is often seen wearing a police cap and sporting a gold earring, paired with a red scarf and a lit cigarette. Their appearance, while unusual, is not the focus of concern.

The personality of subject 8909 is distinct, as they display a voracious appetite for knowledge. They spend a considerable amount of time reading and researching, often opting for obscure or hard-to-find materials. Their passion for learning is visible in their collection of books and documentaries, and they are known to share their newfound knowledge with anyone who will listen. However, their eagerness to share can quickly become overwhelming, resulting in discomfort and unease in their listeners.

Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that subject 8909 may possess an anomalous ability to manipulate financial systems. Their behavior, when observed in close proximity to banks or other financial institutions, has been known to cause unexpected fluctuations in financial markets. The extent and limitations of this ability are yet to be fully understood.

Addendum: Subject 8909's activities have been monitored and observed since their first suspicious activity in the banking system nearly a decade ago. Despite several attempts to apprehend the subject, they have been able to elude capture, suggesting a degree of cunning and evasiveness. Their motives and end goals remain unknown.
