Item #: SCP-7940

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7940 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, with clear and concise instructions presented to security personnel regarding the need for caution in interacting with her. The personal effects that SCP-7940 has on her person are subject to routine inspection, and any suspicious behavior must be reported to on-duty personnel.

Description: SCP-7940 appears to be a human female of average build and height, with distinct orange stripes across her face. Her head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, and she is often seen sporting a silver chain and smoking a cigarette. SCP-7940's appearance is usually unremarkable, save for her striking features.

Personality: SCP-7940 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence and a willful disregard for authority or rules that she deems unnecessary. This trait often leads to rebellious behavior, such as cutting out of work early or taking unauthorized days off. She is quick to speak her mind and does not shy away from confrontation, making her a challenging subject to interact with.

Background: SCP-7940 was discovered working as a theater manager by the Foundation and was brought into containment due to her anomalous behavior. Investigation into her life before containment has yielded little information, and SCP-7940 has been uncooperative in divulging further details.

Addendum: Recent experimentation has shown SCP-7940 to display anomalous traits beyond her rebellious behavior. Further monitoring and study are required.
