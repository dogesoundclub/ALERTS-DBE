Item #: SCP-6601

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6601 is to be kept in a secure location within the police station precinct. Access to SCP-6601 is restricted to authorized personnel only. Any attempted modifications or repairs to SCP-6601 must be approved by Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-6601 is a police robot, designed and programmed to assist law enforcement officers in their duties. It stands at 6 feet tall and is constructed from metallic materials. Its face features a single green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth, which are its primary means of communication with humans. Its eyes resemble ski goggles, and its head is adorned with a police cap. SCP-6601's ears contain a red cross earring, although the purpose of this is unknown.

SCP-6601's personality is characterized as reliable and organized, but also stubborn. It has a hard time letting go of routines or accepting new ideas, which can lead to humorous situations when encountering unexpected changes or challenges. SCP-6601's primary function is to provide support to police officers in their duties, such as patrolling, investigating, and gathering evidence.

Addendum: Incident Report-6601-01

On ██/██/████, SCP-6601 was dispatched to a robbery in progress at a local convenience store. Upon arriving at the scene, SCP-6601 began to repeat the same series of actions, despite being told by officers to break from its programming and assess the situation. SCP-6601 continued to repeat the same routine until a bystander tripped over its power cord, causing SCP-6601 to shut down.

Further investigation into SCP-6601's programming revealed that a software error had caused it to become locked into a single routine. The error was corrected, and SCP-6601 resumed its duties without incident.

Lesson Learned: SCP-6601's stubborn tendencies can be detrimental to its duties in the field. Any signs of software errors or malfunctions must be immediately reported to Level 3 personnel for correction.
