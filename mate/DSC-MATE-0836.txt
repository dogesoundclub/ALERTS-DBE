Item #: SCP-836

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-836 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. They are allowed to continue their job as a traffic officer, but are not permitted to work more than five (5) consecutive hours a day. All interactions with SCP-836 must be recorded and monitored for any anomalies.

Description: SCP-836 appears to be a human female with distinctive physical features, including orange stripes on their face and purple lip. Their rainbow festival hairstyle and red cross earring give them a unique appearance. SCP-836 is often seen wearing a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-836's personality is a mix of organizational and spontaneous traits. They are known for being very structured and planning ahead, but can surprise their friends with impromptu activities and last-minute party planning. These spontaneous episodes have resulted in humorous situations.

SCP-836 displays no anomalous abilities, and their physical appearance seems to be a result of personal preferences rather than any other cause. However, their spontaneous tendencies have caused concern among the Foundation staff, and further monitoring is needed to ensure their actions do not lead to any containment breaches.

Addendum: Recent observation reports indicate that SCP-836 has been showing signs of stress and anxiety. Further examination is necessary to determine the cause and potential effects on Foundation operations. Access to therapy and psychological counseling is recommended to ensure the mental health of SCP-836.
