Item #: 8104

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8104 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. Access to any high-stimulus or audio-visual entertainment must be restricted. Personnel are advised not to engage in conversation as the subject tends to get overly excited and agitated.

Description: Subject 8104 is a female fashion designer of human origin, standing at a height of 5'6''. Its face features bright orange stripes, with rainbow VR LED eyes, and an orange side-head. Its ears are adorned with red cross earrings and a silver chain around the neck. The subject exhibits high energy and enthusiasm towards things, often leading to unforeseen consequences.

SCP-8104's personality is extremely animated and lively, with a tendency to have intense reactions to even the slightest stimuli in its environment. Even the most mundane activities would excite SCP-8104 to a level of exuberant energy that may not be healthy for its wellbeing. We strongly discourage personnel from engaging in activities that could trigger such incidents.

SCP-8104 exhibits an uncanny ability to inspire and excite others with its unbridled energy. There have been instances where SCP-8104 could infect others with its contagious positive attitude, resulting in an outbreak of uncontrollable excitement within the site. Containment procedures must be strict and kept under watch at all times to prevent this spread of excessive energy.

Final Note: SCP-8104 is a potential high-risk threat to the facility. We must remain vigilant and monitor its ongoing behavioral development while devising radical strategies for its containment.
