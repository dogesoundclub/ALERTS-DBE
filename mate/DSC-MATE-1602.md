Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1602 is to be contained in a specially designed cell devoid of all reflective surfaces to prevent her from catching sight of herself.

Description: Subject 1602 is a human female, 5'6" in height, with striking orange stripes running down the sides of her head. She has a large, red clown-inspired smile painted onto her face and sports metal blue hair. Her eyes are an ominous red, and her ears have large jade earrings. She is typically seen wearing a gold chain around her neck, and an ordinary gas mask to hide her appearance.

Subject 1602 exhibits a unique trait that allows her to project random alterations of reality into existence. These anomalies can manifest in many ways, from subtle to catastrophic depending on her mood.
