Item #: SCP-5279

Threat Level: Red

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5279 is to be kept in a secure humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. Due to its capacity for extreme violence, any personnel entering SCP-5279's cell must be accompanied by no less than two armed guards. SCP-5279's requests for inanimate objects must be granted only after thorough screening and approval by Site-██ personnel.

Description: SCP-5279 is a male monkey of the Macaca genus, standing at 1.2 meters tall and weighing approximately 55 kilograms. SCP-5279 appears to have acquired a distinct sense of fashion, often sporting a police cap on its head, a pair of nerd glasses upon its eyes, and a jade earring on its left ear. SCP-5279 also bears a pair of goggles on its forehead and frequently wears a red scarf around its neck, in addition to carrying a cigarette.

SCP-5279 is highly intelligent and communicates through sign language with an impressive vocabulary of over 500 words. Additionally, SCP-5279 has acquired a deep understanding of human social structure and can manipulate situations to its advantage. It is currently in control of a criminal network operating across multiple countries, believed to include over 500 individuals.

SCP-5279 exhibits highly unusual behavior towards inanimate objects, often going out of its way to care for them. SCP-5279 has been observed anthropomorphizing household appliances and even talking to its plants. It is possible that this behavior stems from a deep-seated psychological need for nurturing that has manifested itself in SCP-5279's treatment of inanimate objects.

Addendum: Incident Log 5279-1

On ██/██/20██, SCP-5279 requested a "pet" to keep it company within its cell. After approval from Site-██ personnel, a domesticated cat was introduced into SCP-5279's cell. SCP-5279 took notable interest in the feline, playing with it and feeding it regularly.

However, two weeks later, SCP-5279 was found with the cat in its mouth, having snapped its neck cleanly. SCP-5279 expressed remorse and distress over the incident, claiming that it had only meant to play with the cat and had not intended to harm it.

After this incident, no further requests for "pets" have been granted to SCP-5279.
