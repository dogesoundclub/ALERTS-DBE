SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

SCP-422, codenamed "The Politician," is a human female of average height and build, with a striking appearance that sets her apart from most other politicians. Her face is adorned with orange stripes, trailing down from her forehead to her cheeks, and her lips are a bright red. She is often seen wearing normal glasses which conceal her eyes. SCP-422 also has blonde hair which is typically worn in an Ushanka, providing her with further distinctiveness. She has a penchant for jade earrings and is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck.

While SCP-422's unusual physical appearance may be attention-grabbing, it is her personality that is most noteworthy. She is exceptionally caring and nurturing, towards both living and non-living objects. SCP-422 is known to anthropomorphize her household appliances and often talks to her plants. She is fiercely devoted to her car, which she has named "Maggie" and treats as if it were a living entity. Her nurturing side can make her seem motherly, though she can be fiercely protective of those she cares about.

Despite her extroverted traits, SCP-422 is often very guarded about her personal life, especially when it comes to her political career. Rumors have surfaced about her possible ties to various supernatural organizations, but these have yet to be corroborated. SCP-422 is highly intelligent and skilled at navigating complex political landscapes, making her a valuable asset in the Foundation's efforts to monitor and contain potential magical and supernatural threats.
