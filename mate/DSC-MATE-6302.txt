Item#: 6302

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 6302 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a small open-air courtyard for exercise. A sedative should be administered daily to prevent aggressive behavior. All personnel entering the containment chamber are required to wear a gas mask to protect against any potential outbreaks of disease.

Description: 
Subject 6302 is a male monkey with an unknown eye color. The subject wears a retro cap with a two-color band on the forehead and a jade earring in each ear. Additionally, the subject is adorned with a silver chain that hangs around its neck. Subject 6302 remains in peak physical condition and, despite its size, possesses significant strength.

Personality: 
Subject 6302 displays strong, idealistic tendencies, leading to an uncharacteristic desire to improve its environment. Despite its previous ties to the mafia, the subject has demonstrated a willingness to protest against entities that conflict with its moral compass. It is imperative to maintain a certain level of containment as exposure to outside information can greatly influence the subject's actions. 

Notes: 
Subject 6302's previous affiliation to organized crime was discovered following a string of highly publicized protests that targeted multiple local businesses. While no direct evidence was found linking the subject to the protests, it remains a high priority concern for Foundation operatives. Further investigation into possible connections to other anomalous entities is ongoing.
