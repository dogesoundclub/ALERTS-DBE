Item #: SCP-2850

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2850 is to be kept within a highly secured containment cell at Site-███. All personnel assigned to SCP-2850's cell should be thoroughly screened and cleared by the ethics committee. Any interaction with SCP-2850 should be done through a secure communication channel.

Description: SCP-2850 is a human female in her mid-30s who stands at 5'8". SCP-2850 is a Mafia Boss with a strong sense of intuition that appears to be of extraordinary nature. SCP-2850 has orange stripes on the right side of her face that appear intermittently. Her eyebrows are orange and her ears have golden earrings.

SCP-2850 wears a medical mask over her mouth along with a choker around her neck at all times. When questioned about the cause of her mask, SCP-2850 has been known to become hostile.

SCP-2850's personality is unique in that she possesses an uncanny ability to sense the emotions and thoughts of those around her. This has led to agents reporting that SCP-2850 may have psychic abilities. SCP-2850's ability to predict things before they happen and to sense when someone is feeling upset or anxious has garnered attention from the Foundation.

SCP-2850 should be approached with extreme caution and only interacted with when deemed necessary by the ethics committee. SCP-2850 shows no signs of being a danger to herself or others, but further studies are required to understand the full scope of her anomalous abilities.
