Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-734 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-734 is to be granted only with level 3 or above clearance, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-734 are to be closely monitored and recorded.

Description: DSC-MATE-734, also known as the "Reporter", appears to be a human female of average height and weight, with distinctive spots on her face, a purple lip, and orange eyebrows. She is known for wearing a silver chain as an accessory. DSC-MATE-734 has a natural charm and charisma that makes her immediately likable to most humans. This personality trait has led to her being used by the Foundation to gather information on anomalous events in the city.

DSC-MATE-734's anomalous properties seem to be focused on her personality and her ability to make others feel at ease. When in the vicinity of DSC-MATE-734, most individuals report feeling a sense of calm and contentment, as if all their worries and fears have been lifted. This effect has been observed to have a detrimental effect on individuals with particularly violent or aggressive tendencies, causing them to become lethargic and unresponsive.

DSC-MATE-734's abilities seem to be limited to affecting those within close proximity to her. At this time, it is unclear whether DSC-MATE-734's abilities can be enhanced or exacerbated in any way.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-734 has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, particularly in investigative work. However, it is important to remember that DSC-MATE-734's abilities are not to be underestimated or taken lightly. Careful monitoring and containment procedures are necessary to ensure the safety of both DSC-MATE-734 and those around her.
