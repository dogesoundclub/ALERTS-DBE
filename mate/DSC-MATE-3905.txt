SCP-3905 works as a lawyer, but no record of any prior or ongoing legal activity under the name it uses exists in any known human database. SCP-3905's legal expertise and the services it claims to provide are not anomalous in nature.

SCP-3905 is notable for its gift-giving abilities. SCP-3905 is extremely observant, detail-oriented, and focused when selecting the perfect gift, and its gift-giving skills are widely recognized in the Foundation. However, SCP-3905 is prone to spending an excessive amount of time and energy on gift selection, occasionally reaching a point of obsession.

SCP-3905 is known to smoke cigarettes, but it has no adverse effects on its health.

Addendum: SCP-3905 volunteered to work for the Foundation as an advisor on legal matters. SCP-3905 has provided valuable information on several occasions, and its offer was accepted after a thorough background check. SCP-3905's employment within the Foundation is contingent on its cooperation with the Foundation, and any deviation from this arrangement will result in immediate termination of employment.
