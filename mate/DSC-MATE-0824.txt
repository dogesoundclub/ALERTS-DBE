Subject 824, also known as the "Cyber Joker" among his colleagues, is a human male with distinct and unique features. His face is adorned with numerous spots, giving him an almost polka-dotted appearance, and a wide smile always seems to be plastered across his lips. However, it's his piercing VR Rainbow LED eyes that tend to leave people in awe and create an intimidating presence whenever he enters the room.

His metal purple head is a result of his fascination with technology, which has led him to replace his skull with an augmented processor capable of enhancing his programming skills. Although it leaves others uneasy, it has made him a remarkable asset in the technological world. His gold earring, chain, and other accessories are nothing short of status symbols, and he wears them like trophies.

824 has a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Despite not considering himself the life of the party, he has a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that are surprisingly witty. He is a self-proclaimed code warrior, who is never satisfied with a challenge until he conquers it. 

His intense focus on technology has led him to be isolated from society, making him a misfit. He can be extremely particular about not sharing his expertise with others, as he believes it's his gift and doesn't want to waste it on unworthy recipients.

Despite his eccentric nature, 824 is still human at his core, with emotions and vulnerabilities that only a select few are privy to see. It is said that he can hack into anything known to man; however, getting through his walls is a different story.
