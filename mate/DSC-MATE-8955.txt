Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-8955 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. In order to prevent any incidents arising from the subject's unusual abilities, all researchers assigned to SCP-8955 must wear protective gear while interacting with the subject.

Description:
SCP-8955 is a male rabbit entity, measuring approximately 140cm in height. The subject possesses red clown eyes, and a frightened mouth, which consistently expresses anxiety and fear. SCP-8955 wears a retro cap on its head, accented by a 2 color band and a goggle on its forehead. The subject's attire is completed with a gold chain.

SCP-8955's ability manifests as an unquenchable thirst for knowledge coupled with impressive retention of information. The subject displays a fondness for reading, researching obscure topics, and collecting books or educational materials that align with these interests. SCP-8955 can be quite talkative, passionate, and eager to share these discoveries with others.

SCP-8955 displays significant levels of fear and anxiety, which are attributed to its experiences in the outside world. The Foundation became aware of SCP-8955's unique abilities after a series of incidents related to its work as a fast food worker, which resulted in the subject's relocation to Site-██ for containment.

Addendum:
Researchers are reminded that SCP-8955's aversion to loud noises and sudden movements and the fear exhibited in response to them should be taken into consideration. Avoidance of sudden movements and loud noises should be maintained during all interactions with the subject. Additionally, efforts must be made to acknowledge and alleviate SCP-8955's fears during testing and experimentation to prevent further incidents.
