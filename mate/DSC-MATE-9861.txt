Item #: SCP-9861

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9861 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-9861 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. SCP-9861 is permitted to continue their work as a programmer if they demonstrate no anomalous behavior.

Description: SCP-9861 is a female human, in her mid-30s with normal glasses and a headset with LED lights. SCP-9861 also wears a two-color band on their forehead and a gold chain around their neck. SCP-9861's most notable trait is her fondness for cigarettes, and always keeps one with her.

SCP-9861 has an extraordinary sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. Their humor can be seen in various ways, from telling funny stories to doing silly impersonations, and in many cases, this has led to humorous situations that distract others from their daily routine. 

SCP-9861 is a highly skilled programmer, and the Foundation has recruited them for various projects. During the testing phase, no anomalous behavior was detected, and SCP-9861's programming capabilities proved useful several times. However, it is important to note that they can use their sense of humor to deceive others, which should be taken into account when dealing with SCP-9861. 

Addendum 9861-1: On [REDACTED], SCP-9861 showed anomalous signs during an experiment. Further research suggests an expansion of their containment protocols is needed. Further testing needed.
