Description: 6795 is a male human of average height and weight. Their most notable feature is a pattern of dark spots on their skin which occur with no apparent logical distribution. They have opted for a distinct style, with a choker around their neck and a gas mask worn over their face. The mask leaves their eyes visible, which are a strange VR Jade LED. They also wear a green cross earring on their left ear.

They frequently engage in activism and take a firm stance against practices or organizations that they perceive as being harmful or unjust, even if it brings them into conflict with the law. 6795's moral convictions may appear skewed to an outsider but internally they believe they are making the world a better place.
