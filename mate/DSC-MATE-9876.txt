Item #: SCP-9876

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9876 is to be contained in a specially designed habitat within Site-19. The habitat must be equipped with all necessary equipment and medical supplies to care for SCP-9876. In addition, SCP-9876 is to be fed a diet consisting of raw meat every day. Any injuries sustained by SCP-9876 must be treated immediately by trained staff.

Description: SCP-9876 appears to be a Bengal Tiger that has been endowed with a number of anomalous physical attributes. SCP-9876's most striking feature is the rainbow-colored LED display that replaces its pupils, giving it a unique and somewhat unsettling appearance. SCP-9876's ears are pierced with a jade earring, and it wears a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-9876 has a well-developed sense of humor, and it enjoys playing practical jokes on its handlers. However, it can also be absent-minded, and it has a tendency to become forgetful when it is preoccupied with a task. Despite its forgetfulness, SCP-9876 is a skilled veterinarian, and it has saved the lives of numerous animals within the facility.

SCP-9876 has a police cap on its head at all times, which it considers to be part of its uniform as a veterinarian. Despite its unusual appearance, SCP-9876 is capable of communicating effectively with its handlers, and it is always eager to assist in any way possible.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-9876 escaped from its enclosure and roamed the facility for several hours before being recaptured. During its escape, SCP-9876 was observed to be in possession of a small, handheld device of unknown origin. The device was confiscated and is currently undergoing analysis. SCP-9876 has since been placed under increased surveillance to prevent any further breaches.
