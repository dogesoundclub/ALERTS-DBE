Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3360 is to be monitored at all times via security cameras, with a minimum of two security guards stationed outside their office. Any individuals seeking access to SCP-3360 must receive clearance from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3360 is a humanoid entity identified as a female human politician, known for her humorous personality and ability to make others laugh. SCP-3360 possesses several distinct physical features, including orange stripes and purple lips, as well as red clown eyes and pig tails. SCP-3360 is also frequently seen wearing a choker and a medical mask.

SCP-3360 is highly intelligent and charismatic, possessing the ability to sway crowds with her public speeches and witty remarks. However, SCP-3360's humor can also be potentially dangerous, as she has shown a tendency to take jokes too far and put those around her in harm's way. Reports suggest that SCP-3360 may enjoy causing chaos and conflict, although this has not been confirmed.

SCP-3360 is known to possess a variety of political connections and allies, which she may use to facilitate her own hidden agenda. It is unclear if SCP-3360's humorous personality is a genuine part of her character or if it serves as a fa√ßade to mask her true intentions. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-3360, it is important that she is constantly monitored and contained to prevent any potential breaches.

Addendum: Recent observations indicate that SCP-3360's forehead features may be changing in color and pattern, although the significance of these changes is currently unknown. Further analysis is required to determine if this is a potential anomaly.
