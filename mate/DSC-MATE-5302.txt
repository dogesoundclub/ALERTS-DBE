Item #: 5302

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber is to be furnished with suitable accommodations for a sapient lagomorph, including a small bed, a water dish and regular feeding of fresh vegetables. Access to the subject's chamber is to be restricted to only Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-5302 appears to be a brown Eastern cottontail rabbit, measuring approximately 40cm tall on its hind legs. The subjectâ€™s fur is soft and plush-like, exhibiting a slight reddish tint. Its eyes are of a unique type not seen in rabbits, with the subject wearing normal prescription eyeglasses. It also wears a hooded jacket in a dark blue color, with a red scarf around its neck.

SCP-5302 possesses an unusual characteristic, it can communicate fluently in English through telepathy. During interactions, SCP-5302 has displayed exceptional empathy and understanding towards others, able to understand and comfort those who are experiencing emotional distress. It tends to be jovial and humorous, using its wit to cheer up those in a gloom.

Originally discovered during a foundation undercover operation at a local power station, SCP-5302 was apprehended while performing maintenance on a transformer. After an initial review of its capacity, the rabbit demonstrated remarkable knowledge of electrical engineering and was temporarily enlisted to assist in maintaining the foundation's electrical infrastructure.

Addendum: SCP-5302's access to Foundation electronics and sensitive materials should be reviewed and placed under full review. They continue to work within the Foundation's Electrical Maintenance staff, and increased security measures have been instituted to keep SCP-5302's access limited to tier 3 clearance. 

SCP-5302 appears to be benign and has given no indication of malevolence, but due to its unusual properties, a full psych evaluation should be performed routinely.
