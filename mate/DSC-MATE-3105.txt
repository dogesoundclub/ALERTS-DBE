Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3105 is to be contained at Site-17 and is to be given a separate holding cell with a fully equipped television broadcasting studio. All live broadcasts are to be monitored for any erratic behavior from SCP-3105. SCP-3105 is required to wear a medical mask at all times to prevent the spread of any potential contagions. SCP-3105 is provided with food, water, and a bed inside their cell.

SCP-3105 is not to be approached by anyone without Level-4 clearance or above, except during scheduled interviews or scheduled maintenance of its cell. Additionally, all personnel must undergo a thorough health screening before entering SCP-3105’s cell and must wear a Level-A hazmat suit and full-face respirator during any direct interaction with SCP-3105.

Description:

SCP-3105 is a male human with mouth spot and frightened mouth facial features. Their eyes are made up of VR rainbow LED display. SCP-3105 has a normal blonde hairdo and applies a medical mask on its mouth. SCP-3105 is also recognized as a well-known news anchor in a broadcast network in the United States. 

SCP-3105’s personality manifests as empathetic, caring, and nurturing, similar to a guardian or parent, and has an innate tendency to nurture or protect those under its custody. Its nurturing behavior could lead to distressing situations, such as SCP-3105 treating its relatives, friends, or colleagues as its offspring or wards.

SCP-3105’s anomalous properties, when activated, would instill a compelling influence over its audience within a close radius by way of mind-altering effects. These effects tend to manifest in the audience’s minds as intense loyalty and devotion towards SCP-3105, even though the subject may never have known SCP-3105 previously. These effects also could prompt a greater susceptibility to any suggestion made by SCP-3105. 

Addendum:

SCP-3105 was discovered by the Foundation after they were reported to have called their co-workers or colleagues its “children.” Authority personnel operatives also noted anomalous reactions from viewers after SCP-3105 broadcasts its news, especially those who watched SCP-3105's transmissions for over an extended duration. SCP-3105 was then prompt by Foundation operatives for a series of interviews and cognitive testing before being classified as an SCP object. SCP-3105 has been placed in site 17 containment indefinitely.
