Item #: SCP-3406

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3406 is to be monitored at all times while operating as a Traffic Officer, with regular psychological evaluations and physical examinations scheduled. Any unusual behavior or activity must be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation agent.

Description: SCP-3406 is a human traffic officer who possesses blue clown eyes, green unruly hair, and pierced with a green cross earring. His most distinct feature is his constant smile that seems to never leave his face. SCP-3406 is often seen wearing a red scarf around his neck, which he claims is "lucky."

SCP-3406 has a strong sense of independence and often refuses to ask for help, even in situations where help is necessary. SCP-3406's stubborn nature has led to some comical situations such as attempting to move heavy furniture by himself or refusing to use a map when lost. In these situations, SCP-3406's colleagues have noted his unwavering determination to succeed, even when the odds are against him.

SCP-3406's personality has been noted to change during certain astronomical events, such as meteor showers or eclipses. During these events, SCP-3406 becomes more reclusive and aggressive, displaying a lack of cooperation with others.

It is unknown how SCP-3406's anomalous properties manifest, but Foundation researchers speculate that they are linked to his blue clown eyes and green hair. Further study on this matter is necessary to determine the true nature of SCP-3406's abilities.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-3406 was found to be in possession of a small object that appears to manipulate reality on a limited scale. Testing on this object is ongoing, and SCP-3406 has been deemed a potential security risk. All researchers and personnel are to treat him as such, and precautions are to be taken accordingly.
