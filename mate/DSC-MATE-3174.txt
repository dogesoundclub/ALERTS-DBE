Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3174 is to be housed in a standard containment unit at Site-██. Interaction with SCP-3174 is to be limited to designated personnel only. Any attempts to modify, reprogram, or tamper with SCP-3174 are strictly prohibited.

Description:

SCP-3174 is a male robot with ski goggle eyes, a not arranged green head, and red cross earrings on its ears. The robot is often seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle as its accessories. SCP-3174's primary occupation is as a farmer, utilizing its advanced technological capabilities to increase crop yield and efficiency.

SCP-3174's personality is characterized by a strong value for tradition, often telling jokes and stories passed down through its family and community. However, SCP-3174 can also display a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to completing tasks, causing humorous situations to arise between the robot and its human counterparts.

Addendum:

SCP-3174 was recovered by the Foundation after reports of a "robot farmer" began to surface in local communities. Foundation agents discovered SCP-3174's advanced technological capabilities and promptly contained the entity for further study. While SCP-3174 does not pose a direct threat to human life, its potential impact on agricultural production warrants continued observation and study.
