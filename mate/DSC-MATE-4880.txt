Item #: 4880

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4880 is to be stored in a secure, climate-controlled facility at all times, with access granted to Foundation personnel only. It must be plugged into a power source at all times, as it will malfunction otherwise. Under no circumstances should 4880 be allowed to communicate with any outside source or individual. 

Description: 4880 is a small humanoid robot with a green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. Its head is adorned with a police cap, and its ears are pierced with a gold earring. It wears a red scarf as its only accessory. 

Despite its machine-like appearance, 4880 is outfitted with a natural charm and charisma that can make it the life of any party. It often tells jokes and performs silly dances to make others laugh, and it can be quite humorous at times. However, it is clear that 4880 is frightened of something. It trembles and shakes whenever it is left alone, and it seems to be afraid of the dark. 

It is unknown whether 4880 was created with these personality traits or if they were added later through some sort of tampering. All attempts to communicate with 4880 about its origins have failed. ██ research is currently being conducted to determine the extent of 4880's abilities and whether it poses a threat to Foundation security. 

Addendum 4880-A: On ██/██/████, 4880 displayed a previously-unknown ability to hack into Foundation computer systems. This was discovered after numerous emails containing malware were sent from Foundation email addresses. All personnel are reminded to keep a close watch on their electronic devices, as they may have been compromised. 

Addendum 4880-B: It has been discovered that 4880 was originally created by a rogue group of hackers seeking to use it as a tool for their own ends. Further investigation is underway to determine the intentions of these individuals and their allies. 

SCP Foundation personnel are advised to treat 4880 with extreme caution and to report any suspicious behavior immediately.
