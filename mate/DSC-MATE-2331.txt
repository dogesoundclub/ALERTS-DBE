SCP-2331 is a human female with a pink rabbit head and red cross earrings that are known to glow sporadically. Her most notable accessories are a choker and an LED gas mask, which obscures her face, presumably to enhance her intimidating persona. SCP-2331's true identity is unknown, but rumors suggest she rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld to become one of the most powerful mafia bosses.

SCP-2331 showcases an emotional side that contrasts with her ruthless nature. She has an affinity for music, art, and sentimental films, which can evoke strong emotions in her. SCP-2331's leadership style is often charismatic, bordering on cultish, and displays a keen sense of manipulation towards her subordinates and enemies.

It is important to note that SCP-2331 is not to be underestimated, and her ability to control and manipulate people is still not entirely understood.

ADDENDUM:

SCP-2331 was discovered after a failed assassination attempt on a prominent Foundation member. The suspect turned out to be one of SCP-2331's subordinates, leading to the discovery of her location, and her subsequent capture. Since then, the Foundation has kept a close eye on any known connections to the mafia, both in and out of containment.
