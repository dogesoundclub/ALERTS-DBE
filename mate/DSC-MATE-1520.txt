Item #: 1520

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. #1520 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. She is not to be given access to any electrical equipment that she may use to feed off energy.

Description: Dr. #1520 is a female human with orange-striped facial features. Her head is unusual in that it is green with curled edges. She also wears a gold chain and a pair of earrings that are of a unique design. Her personality is characterized by her tremendous energy and enthusiasm. She uses her exuberance to inspire others and often finds herself in humorous situations due to her over-eagerness.

Dr. #1520 is a medical doctor and can be called upon to aid in the medical treatment of other containment subjects. Her expertise in the field of medicine has been very valuable to Foundation scientists, as she can diagnose and treat many different ailments.

Although Dr. #1520 has been deemed safe for Foundation personnel, her ability to feed off the energy of others is a cause for concern. Recent investigations have shown that her body has an unusually high energy output. If left unchecked, this could lead to a dangerous and uncontrollable buildup of energy within her cells.

In conclusion, Dr. #1520 may seem harmless due to her enthusiastic nature, but her ability to feed off energy is a serious concern. The Foundation must continue to monitor her closely to prevent any unintended consequences.
