Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8903 was temporarily removed from standard containment for testing of their anomalous properties. During the course of testing, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-8903 possesses a unique ability to induce laughter in those nearby, even in situations where it would not be appropriate or expected. Efforts to replicate this ability have thus far proved unsuccessful. As a result, DSC-MATE-8903 has been designated as a Safe-class anomaly, with all related studies reserved for authorized personnel only.
