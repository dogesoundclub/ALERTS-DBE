Item #: SCP-329

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-329 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a minimum size of 4 x 4 x 4 meters. SCP-329's chamber must always remain locked when not in use, and must be constantly monitored through a surveillance system. Any deliveries made by SCP-329 must be supervised by at least two security personnel.

Description: SCP-329 is a delivery driver of unknown origin. SCP-329 appears to be a monkey and measures approximately 1 meter tall. SCP-329 wears a purple cap with a headset and a goggle on its forehead, and is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck. SCP-329 exhibits physical abilities that exceed those of a typical primate and has been observed using tools to complete tasks.

SCP-329 often acts impulsively and without caution, which has resulted in many accidents and mishaps while making deliveries. SCP-329 has been known to show off and impress others, even though this behavior often leads to dangerous situations. Despite this recklessness, SCP-329 is generally friendly and approaches people without any aggression.

SCP-329 is able to communicate with humans through a limited vocabulary of common phrases, and can understand basic commands. However, SCP-329 exhibits no desire to interact with personnel outside of work-related tasks.

Addendum: SCP-329 was apprehended by Foundation personnel after reports of a rogue delivery driver with unusual abilities surfaced in several cities. SCP-329 was subsequently contained and has been under the care of the Foundation ever since. Despite its reckless behavior, SCP-329 has proven valuable in the delivery of crucial items to Foundation sites.
