Item #: SCP-4618

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4618 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with all necessary facilities. SCP-4618's diet consists primarily of fruits and vegetables, and is to be provided with fresh food twice a day. SCP-4618 is not to be released into the wild, as their behavior may prove a danger to the surrounding environment.

Description: SCP-4618 is a male monkey delivery driver. SCP-4618 stands approximately 1 meter tall and weighs approximately 15 kilograms. SCP-4618 bears a police cap on its head and horn-rimmed eyeglasses over its eyes, and can be typically seen wearing a gold chain.

SCP-4618 displays a personality that is unique to its species, being fiercely independent and stubborn. SCP-4618 will often refuse help even when it is needed, such as during attempts to move heavy furniture or when needing directions when lost. SCP-4618's behavior can result in comical situations that end in its own detriment.

SCP-4618's forehead bears a two-color band which gives it a distinct appearance. SCP-4618's frightened mouth also serves to make it easily identifiable.

SCP-4618's ability to speak and understand human language is yet to be successfully documented or tested.

Addendum: The delivery company that originally employed SCP-4618 was found to be illegally using anomalous entities as drivers. All other known entities have been detained and contained, while SCP-4618's cooperation with the Foundation was negotiated in exchange for amnesty. SCP-4618, despite initial reluctance, has since proven to be a valuable addition to the Foundation's research endeavors.
