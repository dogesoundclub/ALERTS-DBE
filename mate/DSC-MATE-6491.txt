Description: SCP-6491 is a male Siberian tiger in his mid-20s. SCP-6491 displays unusual physical traits, such as a frightened mouth and a medical mask covering its muzzle at all times, most likely due to previous injuries. SCP-6491 also possesses a distinctive red cross earring, which it refuses to answer any inquiries about.

SCP-6491 wears a police cap and a red scarf as its primary accessories, which it claims to have "borrowed" during one of its many "adventures". SCP-6491 displays a love for adventures and taking risks, regardless of the possible consequences, often leading to humorous stories.

SCP-6491 exhibits a high-temperature output, reaching levels up to 1000 Â°C, when provoked or feeling threatened, causing environmental hazards that can lead to sudden fires.
