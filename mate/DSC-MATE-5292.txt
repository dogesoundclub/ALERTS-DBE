Item #: SCP-5292

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5292 is to be monitored through standard camera surveillance and must undergo a monthly psychological evaluation. SCP-5292 is allowed to continue his job as a banker, but is not permitted to interact with clients for extended periods of time. Any reported emotional outbursts or empathetic reactions are to be noted and reported to Site-██ immediately.

Description: SCP-5292 is a human male with distinct orange stripes on his face. SCP-5292's eyes appear to be normal glasses, and a pair of goggles are constantly resting on his forehead. SCP-5292 can often be seen wearing a silver chain and a jade earring on one ear.

SCP-5292's most distinct characteristic is his empathetic nature. SCP-5292 is easily moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering, and has a strong fondness for animals and nature. SCP-5292's emotional state can be triggered by various means, including in-person interaction, visual stimuli, and audio recordings.

SCP-5292's emotional response remains mysterious, but it is suspected that it is a result of an anomalous genetic mutation. SCP-5292 has been determined to be safe and does not pose a threat to the Foundation or to normalcy.

Addendum: Personnel are reminded to treat SCP-5292 with the utmost respect and care due to his emotional sensitivity. Tasks involving SCP-5292 must be handled with caution and an understanding of his empathetic nature.
