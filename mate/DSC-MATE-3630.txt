Item #: SCP-3630

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3630 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to their strong idealistic tendencies, SCP-3630 is to be given access to books, articles and documentaries to satisfy their need to work towards improving the world. It is important to keep a close watch on SCP-3630's movements, especially during public gatherings.

Description: SCP-3630 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth and normal glasses. SCP-3630's head is covered by a red beanie, with a 2-color band appearing on their forehead. SCP-3630 has a silver chain around their neck, which appears to be of no significant value. SCP-3630 also carries a cigarette in their right hand and a jade earring on their left ear.

SCP-3630's personality tends to be very idealistic, with a strong desire to create a better world. They are widely known for their tendency to protest or boycott companies or causes that go against their values. SCP-3630's actions have in the past resulted in humorous situations but have also continuously drawn attention from the Foundation for their unpredictable movements.

SCP-3630 claims to be a farmer, but its verification remains unattainable as no information on this subject has been traceable. SCP-3630 speaks with a slightly high pitched voice and multiple accents, including an Irish accent and slang dialects.

SCP-3630's anomalous abilities remain unknown as there have been no reported events amplifying its farming capacity or in altering an environment around it. Nevertheless, the Foundation continues to monitor SCP-3630's status for any possible developments.
