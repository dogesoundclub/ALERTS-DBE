Item #: 5864

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5864 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any attempted communication with SCP-5864 must be conducted remotely to avoid her anomalous properties. All interactions must be conducted via video or audio recording equipment.

Description: SCP-5864 is a female human identified as a programmer. SCP-5864 has distinct facial features, including purple lips and red clown eyes, giving the subject a visually unsettling appearance. The subject's head resembles that of an early 2000s schoolgirl with a goggle on the forehead. SCP-5864 wears a jade earring and a silver chain, with a gas mask she wears as a standard accessory.

SCP-5864's personality displays constant traits of assertiveness and decisiveness. They prioritize efficiency and productivity above all else, often coming across as bossy or intimidating in their approach to achieve their goals. The subject's strong will and focus on completing a task can sometimes lead to reckless behaviors, which, when coupled with their anomalous properties, can cause a dangerous situation.

SCP-5864's anomalous properties manifest when any human within close proximity to the subject (within a five-meter radius) comes under her control. The effect is almost instantaneous, causing the controlled person to become highly susceptible to SCP-5864's orders, regardless of their own morals or values. Any attempt to resist the effect deteriorates rapidly, causing deterioration to mental facilities, and eventually, death.

SCP-5864's ability to control others makes it a hazardous anomaly, and all interactions with the subject must occur via video or audio means. Researchers must be cautious when interacting with SCP-5864, ensuring they take no physical or verbal action that would allow the subject to gain control. In the event of SCP-5864 causing any anomalies or harm, all personnel must follow standard protocol for containment procedure.
