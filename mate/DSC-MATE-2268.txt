Item #: 2268

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2268 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Basic amenities such as food, water, and clothing are to be provided, as well as a television set to allow for the subject to maintain their current profession. All communication with subject 2268 must be monitored and recorded for research purposes.

Description: Subject 2268 is a male human with spotted skin, blue clown eyes, and green cross earrings. The subject often wears a silver chain around their neck as an accessory. Despite their unique physical features, subject 2268 appears to be a normal human and displays no anomalous properties.

However, subject 2268's personality is of interest to our research. They have a strong nurturing and caring nature, often treating friends and family members as if they were their own children. This aspect of subject 2268's personality has caused some humorously awkward situations, such as when they attempted to tuck in an adult friend at a sleepover or tried to cut up their food for them.

It is unknown if this personality trait is related to their physical appearance or an unrelated aspect of their psychology. Further research is needed to determine if subject 2268's unique personality traits have any connection to the paranormal or supernatural.

Addendum: As of [redacted], subject 2268 has been employed as a news anchor for a local television station. Continued observation of their behavior in this role is encouraged.
