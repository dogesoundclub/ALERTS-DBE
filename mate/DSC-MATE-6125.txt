Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6125 is to be kept in standard human living quarters within the secure wing of Site-17. They are allowed to freely move about the facility and perform their duties as a doctor, but are to always be escorted by armed personnel due to their anomalous appearance. The LED headpiece and medical mask are to be worn at all times when in the presence of other personnel or guests. Any attempts to remove or damage either item must be met with extreme force. Subject 6125 has requested to bring their gold chain accessory with them, which has been approved as long as it does not interfere with their work or cause harm to others.

Description: Subject 6125 is a human female with distinct orange stripes on her face, resembling that of a tiger. Their eyes are blue with a clown-like appearance and they sport a noticeable smile. Subject 6125 is always seen wearing a medical mask over their mouth and a headset with an LED display. It has been noted that the LED display changes color based on their emotions or mental state.

Personality: Subject 6125 is highly analytical and logical, often making them a valuable asset in their role as a doctor. However, they also possess a quirky sense of humor and enjoy making dry, witty observations or teasing their friends. They tend to keep to themselves and appear distant, but are capable of forming strong bonds with those they trust.

Addendum: Subject 6125 has been known to express a desire to experiment on anomalous entities within containment, claiming it would further their understanding of anomalous phenomena. This request has been denied, as ethics and safety protocols must be upheld above all else. Any attempts to breach containment or experiment on anomalous entities will result in immediate disciplinary action.
