Item #: SCP-6400

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6400 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-6400's chamber is restricted to personnel with clearance level 2 and above. SCP-6400 must only be allowed to interact with humans through authorized interviews and negotiations. Under no circumstances should SCP-6400 be permitted to leave its containment chamber without direct orders from O5 Command.

Description: SCP-6400 is a humanoid entity of the female sex identified as a practicing lawyer in the United States of America. SCP-6400 is visually distinct due to the presence of numerous spots on its face, which are localized primarily around the cheekbones and nose. SCP-6400 also has a seemingly permanent smile on its face, adding to its appearance of approachability.

SCP-6400's most notable features are its eyes, which resemble those commonly associated with clowns. The eyes of SCP-6400 are red and protrude slightly from its face, giving it a slightly surreal appearance. SCP-6400 also has green hair which it keeps tied into a bun under a purple cap.

SCP-6400 is known to accessorize with a gold chain and a lit cigarette. SCP-6400's ears are pierced, and it often wears a jade earring on the right side.

Personality: SCP-6400 displays an emotive personality, often expressing its emotions freely without reservation. It frequently displays a fondness for music and art that stimulates strong feelings within it. Exposure to sentimental moments depicted in movies or television shows have been known to cause SCP-6400 to shed tears.

SCP-6400 has an impressive talent for negotiating and is known to be quite persuasive to achieve a successful outcome for its clients. It displays excellent communication skills with an innate ability to read body language and vocal tones, giving it the edge in heated debates.

SCP-6400 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel and has provided valuable information on several occasions in exchange for leniency in its containment. However, personnel should make no mistake that SCP-6400 is dangerous when provoked and has shown to possess a sharp wit and an ability to manipulate the emotions of those it interacts with by utilizing its persuasive abilities.

Addendum 6400-1: Due to its ability to influence emotions and manipulate communication, SCP-6400 is considered a valuable asset for containment breach negotiations with other humanoid SCP entities. As such, SCP-6400 will be granted temporary release from its containment chamber under the supervision of personnel during such negotiations. SCP-6400 is to be returned to containment immediately after the conclusion of negotiations.
