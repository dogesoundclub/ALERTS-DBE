SCP-6087, also known as "Dr. Stripes," is a male Tiger, standing at an impressive 6 feet tall. His appearance may invoke fear in some, as his mouth has a perpetual look of fright upon it - perhaps from years of dealing with the unknown or simply due to his innate predator instincts. His eyes are a striking VR Jade LED, pulsing with knowledge and intelligence. 

Dr. Stripes' head is covered in thick, not-arranged green fur, marking him as a rare and unique species within the Foundation. He also wears a solitary gold earring on his left ear, hinting at a past life before his role as a doctor in the paranormal research facility.

Despite his fearsome appearance, Dr. Stripes' personality is focused on detail-oriented tasks, such as gift-giving. He has an uncanny ability to read a person's desires and wants, but this can also lead to him obsessing over finding the perfect present - sometimes hindering his ability to complete other tasks effectively.

Dr. Stripes' medical expertise is second to none, as his keen senses and predatory instincts allow him to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries that other doctors may miss. However, his experiences within the SCP Foundation have granted him knowledge and insights into the unknown, adding to his impressive skill set.

Approach with caution, as Dr. Stripes may appear intimidating at first glance. But rest assured, his observational skills and medical knowledge make him a valuable asset to the Foundation.
