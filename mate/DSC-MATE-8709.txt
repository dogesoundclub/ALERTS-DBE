Item #: SCP-8709

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8709 is to be constantly monitored by CCTV cameras while on duty as a Traffic Officer in the city. Any signs of abnormal behavior should be reported to the nearest Site Director immediately. SCP-8709 should not be allowed to make any decisions beyond his normal duties.

Description: SCP-8709 is a human male currently employed as a Traffic Officer. SCP-8709 has a distinctive Mouth Spot and his mouth appears to be constantly expressing fear, even when he is not feeling any. His eyes are red and resemble those of a clown. SCP-8709 wears a police cap and has a 2 color band on his forehead. His ears have a jade earring on one side.

SCP-8709 has an innate ability for leadership and often finds himself taking charge of situations, whether it be at work, in a social group, or even in his personal life. This is believed to be linked to the anomalous properties of SCP-8709. SCP-8709's behavior has been observed to become increasingly erratic in situations where he is given too much power or if facing significant stressors.

SCP-8709's anomalous properties were discovered after several complaints from the public about their erratic behavior while on duty. Further investigation revealed that SCP-8709's ability for leadership could become highly transformative in certain situations.

Addendum: SCP-8709 has been formally reprimanded for his involvement in a recent incident where he attempted to take command of an unrelated site containment breach while on duty. SCP-8709 has since shown no signs of undue influence and is permitted to continue his duties as a Traffic Officer.
