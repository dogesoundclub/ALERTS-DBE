SCP-8607 is a humanoid entity, identified as a female banker. Her face is covered in spots, and she is often seen wearing red lipstick that contrasts sharply against her pale skin. Her eyes are an unnatural shade of blue, reminiscent of a clown's, and seem to glow in the dark. Her head is adorned with rainbow festival decorations, adding to her bizarre appearance.

SCP-8607's ears are pierced with a red cross earring, and she is usually seen wearing a silver chain around her neck. However, the most striking feature of this entity is the LED gas mask she wears, completely obscuring her face at all times. The purpose of the mask is unknown, but it is suspected to be a form of self-protection.

Despite her strange appearance, SCP-8607 is known for her dry sense of humor, often taking people by surprise with her deadpan delivery. She may not consider herself the life of the party, but she can still command attention with her unexpected jokes. It is advised that personnel approach her with caution, as her unpredictable nature could lead to unexpected consequences.
