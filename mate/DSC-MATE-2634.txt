Description: SCP-2634 is a sentient rabbit of unknown breed, standing at approximately 3 feet tall on its hind legs. Its fur is predominantly green in color, and its frightened mouth makes it appear as though it is in a perpetual state of agitation. SCP-2634 has no discernible eyes, although it is capable of seeing its surroundings and navigating complex environments. 

SCP-2634 exhibits impulsive tendencies and often acts on its emotions before exercising restraint. As a result, it can become unpredictable and difficult to control, often leading to unexpected situations. SCP-2634's personality has been observed as generally friendly, but it can become hostile when it feels threatened or cornered. 

SCP-2634 is a train driver by profession and has been trained to operate a variety of locomotives. Its skill set also includes familiarity with various track layouts and emergency procedures. It is essential to note that SCP-2634 operates with a silver chain and whistle and that it will refuse to operate any train without these two articles present. 

Addendum: SCP-2634 has shown an affinity for human companionship and has been observed engaging in playful behavior when interacting with Foundation personnel. Nevertheless, its impulsive tendencies continue to pose potential risks, and therefore interactions must be conducted within a controlled environment.
