Foundation personnel were able to confiscate the device, but messages exchanged remain unclear. Further investigations regarding how SCP-4742 acquired the device and its intended recipient are currently ongoing.

Addendum 4742-2: On ██/██/██, SCP-4742 was found in possession of a set of car keys labeled to a ████████ brand vehicle not registered within Foundation inventory. Upon questioning, SCP-4742 claimed to have acquired the vehicle through unknown means. After confiscating the keys, all attempts to locate said vehicle have been unsuccessful. Further investigations regarding SCP-4742's ability to acquire items remain ongoing.
