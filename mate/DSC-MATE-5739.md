Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5739 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. It is important to note that DSC-MATE-5739 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence and may attempt to resist containment. As such, security cameras must be installed within its chamber and surrounding areas to ensure that it does not leave its designated area.

DSC-MATE-5739 is permitted to work as a Fashion Designer, however, in accordance with its personality, access to the office must be limited strictly to its required work hours only. Any attempts to leave early or take unauthorized leave must be reported immediately to security personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-5739 is a male rabbit with red clown eyes, dressed in a hoodie, red victory band across the forehead, red scarf, and carrying a whistle. Its mouth is consistently displayed in a frightened expression. DSC-MATE-5739 displays a high level of intelligence, and the ability to communicate with other humanoids with relative ease.

DSC-MATE-5739 has a notable rebellious streak, a trait which is not uncommon amongst its species. It has shown resistance to authority and will often attempt to bend or break the rules if deemed unnecessary. This includes taking days off without permission or leaving work early. While DSC-MATE-5739 can prove difficult to control, it has shown no aggressive tendencies towards either humanoids or other DSCs.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5739 has expressed an interest in creating "fashionable" items for the DogeSoundClub, specifically for humanoids with unique physical characteristics. Further investigation into this request is pending.
