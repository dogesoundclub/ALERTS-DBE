Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be kept in a regular residential apartment, with access to necessary medical services and a designated emergency response unit. Any and all attempts to separate the subject from his fellow firefighter colleagues should be avoided.

Description: Subject 6772 is a male human, identified as a firefighter by profession. He possesses a distinct feature on his mouth, which has been documented as a "spot". His eyes are often seen adorned by nerd glasses. It is worth noting that his head of hair is never arranged nor styled, which could suggest a lack of self-care. Subject habitually sports two accessories, a silver chain and a peculiar LED gas mask.

6772 displays an amicable personality and holds great value in his social connections, often prioritizing such interpersonal relationships over professional responsibilities. Though he strives for harmony with the people around him, he is also known to exhibit humorous quips or indulge in playful banter. This can sometimes hinder his work and cause increased danger to himself and others.

Subjects with these characteristics have been known to engage in reckless behavior, which could prove disastrous during emergency situations. Any instance of such behavior should be reported immediately to the Foundation. 

Addendum: Following incident 6772-D, further psychological evaluations are required for Subject 6772 to guarantee that no anomalous abilities have been developed due to unknown circumstances. Contact with anomalous compounds or entities is suspected, and further investigation is necessary.
