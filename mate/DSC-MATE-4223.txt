Description: SCP-4223 is a female human politician with striking features. SCP-4223's red lips and blue clown eyes are believed to be the result of extensive cosmetic surgery. SCP-4223 consistently wears a gold earring on her left ear, as well as a silver chain around her neck. SCP-4223 is often seen with a lit cigarette in her hand, which she will use to periodically light dark-colored cloths.

SCP-4223's personality is highly social and outgoing. She enjoys being the center of attention and has been known to tell humorous anecdotes or jokes that induce fits of laughter in bystanders. SCP-4223 has demonstrated an ability to sway listeners with her charm and eloquence, though the specific method by which she exerts this influence is unknown.

Addendum: After a significant number of SCP-4223's constituents began exhibiting symptoms of heightened suggestibility and susceptibility to persuasive speech, the Foundation began monitoring SCP-4223's public appearances. A report detailing SCP-4223's involvement in various occult organizations and rituals is currently being compiled.
