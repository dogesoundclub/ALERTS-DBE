Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3998 is to be confined to a secure containment chamber at Site-██. Access is limited to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Under no circumstances are any Foundation personnel to interact with DSC-MATE-3998 outside of approved testing or observation periods. DSC-MATE-3998 is to be monitored at all times by security personnel with non-lethal weapons.

Description: DSC-MATE-3998 is a robotic entity, designed to resemble a humanoid dog. DSC-MATE-3998 stands at approximately 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall and weighs approximately 80 kilograms (176 pounds). Its primary DSC-MATE-3998-A, a custom-made Doge hat, which appears to be its source of energy.

Addendum-3998-A: Incident-3998-01

On ██/██/201█, DSC-MATE-3998 experienced a sudden and unexplained surge of energy while operating Train ██. DSC-MATE-3998's usual demeanor became more erratic, and Command reported instances of DSC-MATE-3998 speaking in languages unknown to Foundation researchers. Attempts to remotely disable DSC-MATE-3998's systems failed, and eventually, Foundation Personnel were forced to use non-lethal weapons to tame the entity.

Since then, DSC-MATE-3998 has been under observation and is known to have periodic surges of energy. Any personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-3998 is required to be trained in advanced robotics and to maintain proper control measures. Any attempts to modify DSC-MATE-3998's programming have been deemed a risky undertaking and are not currently approved.
