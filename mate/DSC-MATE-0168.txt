SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-168

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-168 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-168 is strictly limited to Level 4 personnel or above, who must wear protective gear at all times when interacting with the subject. SCP-168 is permitted to continue with their job as a fashion designer, but must be accompanied by at least one Foundation agent at all times.

Description: SCP-168 is a human male with a unique appearance, which includes a spot on their mouth, a constantly smiling face, and VR rainbow LED eyes. SCP-168's head is adorned with a peak spike, and they constantly wear a medical mask over their mouth. SCP-168 also wears a goggle on their forehead, as well as a Jade Earring and a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-168's personality is described as absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time and forgetting appointments or important events. This has led to some humorous situations, but it is also seen as a potential security risk. SCP-168 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become easily distracted by their work as a fashion designer. 

SCP-168's anomalous properties are not fully understood, but it is believed that their unique appearance may have an effect on those around them. SCP-168 has been known to cause feelings of disorientation, confusion, and even hallucinations in individuals who spend prolonged periods of time with them. SCP-168 has also shown the ability to manipulate reality on a small scale, although this ability is currently being researched further by Foundation personnel.

Addendum: Due to SCP-168's potential danger, it has been suggested that they be given a Class A amnestic and released back into society. However, further research is needed before any final decisions can be made.
