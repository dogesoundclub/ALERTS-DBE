Item #: 2250

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2250 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment accommodations with appropriate safety measures. Due to the subject's nature in the outside world, he is to be kept in a secure location to prevent any accidental exposure of his anomalous traits to the public. Regular psychological evaluations are to be conducted to ensure the stability of the subject.

Description: Subject 2250 appears to be a humanoid male of average height, weighing approximately 175 lbs. While physically appearing completely human, the subject displays anomalous eye coloration with red clown-like eyes. The subject's appearance is otherwise normal, with a hoodie covering his head and a two-color band adorning his forehead. Additionally, he wears a red scarf as his accessory.

Personality: Subject 2250 displays an extremely organized and efficient personality, often being described as controlling. This tendency to micromanage is displayed in various situations, including group projects or events, and delegating tasks in a matter-of-fact way. It is believed that this is a direct result of the subject's anomalous traits.

Notes: Subject 2250 possesses no known abilities or skills beyond his organization skills which could pose any threat to foundation goals. However, the subject's psychological quirks may present some level of difficulty in containing him, but currently poses no risk to the general public.
