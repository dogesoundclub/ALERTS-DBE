Item #: 5520

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5520 is to be monitored at all times, with regular check-ins by Foundation psychiatric staff. Due to their emotional sensitivity and potential for manipulation by anomalous entities, 5520 is not to be allowed access to sensitive information, and is to be kept away from situations that may trigger an emotional outburst.

Description: Subject 5520 is a human male with numerous distinctive physical features. The subject is often seen wearing a bucket hat with a red victory band on their forehead, and sporting a silver chain around the neck. The subject also has numerous spots on his face and a perpetually happy smile, which can be disconcerting when combined with their blue clown eyes. The most notable accessory is a lit cigarette, which never seems to burn down.

Personality: 5520 has a keen sense of their own emotions, often being moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies and TV shows. They are also deeply affected by music and art, particularly pieces that evoke strong feelings. However, this sensitivity can also make 5520 vulnerable to manipulation by entities with anomalous emotional abilities.

Additional Notes: 5520 is employed as an electrician by the Foundation, responsible for maintaining electrical systems at various sites. While his emotional sensitivity may be a concern, 5520's skills in his field make him a valuable asset to the Foundation.
