Interaction with the subject is only allowed with approval from a Level 3 clearance personnel.

Description: 

Subject 2129 appears as a female human with brown hair from the 90s. Her eyes are Jade LED that resemble virtual reality technology. A goggle is kept constantly strapped to her forehead, and she wears a red cross earring on one of her ears. A silver chain is found around her neck, complementing her overall clothing style that makes her look like a farmer.

Subject 2129 is cooperative and does not pose any immediate danger to the facility. However, the safety measures employed to monitor her must remain in place to ensure no unwanted guests can access the premises.

Additional Note:

Subject 2129 may hold the key to several unanswered questions about an adjoining urban area. Research staff are directed to keep taps on any details teased out by 2129. Any communications pursued may only take place with the approval of Level 3 access.
