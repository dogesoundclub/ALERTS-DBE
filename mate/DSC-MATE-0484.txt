Item #: 484

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: Item 484 is no longer in containment and has been deemed neutralized. Any sightings of a tiger matching its description should be reported to local authorities.

Description: Item 484 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall and weighing around 600 pounds. Its most distinctive feature is its ski goggle-like eyes which have been observed to change color depending on its mood. Its head is adorned with green hair styled in a purple cap, and a gold earring dangles from its left ear.

Item 484 often wore a silver chain around its neck and was frequently seen with a cigarette in its mouth. Its behavior was noted by those who interacted with it to be empathetic and compassionate, although it had a tendency to take others' problems as its own and was known to try and fix everything and everyone around it.

Addendum: Item 484 was initially captured by Foundation personnel after reports of a large tiger wandering around a local neighborhood. It was taken into containment and evaluated for any anomalous abilities, but none were found. After a few weeks, it displayed an interest in veterinary medicine and was allowed to become a veterinarian within the Foundation. It worked in this capacity for several years until it was deemed safe for release back into the wild. Surveillance on Item 484 has since been discontinued.
