Addendum 6177-1: Encounter with Dr. Wondertainment

On ██/██/20██, SCP-6177 was found wandering outside Site-██, holding a Dr. Wondertainment brand box. The box contained a Dr. Wondertainment branded toy, which had been severely damaged from use. When questioned about its intentions with the toy, SCP-6177 became agitated and refused to answer further questioning. It was later discovered that SCP-6177 had taken care of several children who were also in the possession of Dr. Wondertainment toys. SCP-6177 was reprimanded and reminded that it cannot provide items from outside sources to other SCPs without permission.
