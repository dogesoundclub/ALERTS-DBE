Item #: 2301

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2301 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished with standard amenities, with a focus on the provision of the electrical equipment known to soothe the monkey. The cell must be fitted with a security system linked to a remote monitoring station, allowing staff to keep track of the monkey's behavior swiftly. Personal visits should only be authorized by Level 3 personnel or higher, and must be accompanied by at least two armed guards.

Description: Item #2301 appears to be a male monkey. The monkey has red clown eyes and is identified to wear a jade earring on its ears. It is also seen wearing a red scarf. The monkey displays a high level of intelligence, exhibiting proficiency in the trade of electrical repair and maintenance; hence, it is recommended that Item #2301 should be allowed to work as an electrician under monitored conditions. The monkey seems to possess a quirky sense of humor, often making witty observations or teasing its acquaintances.

Addendum: Item #2301 was brought to the Foundation's attention following reports of a strange electrical surge and a string of unexplainable repairs, monitored to have been carried out in locations close to the monkey's habitat. Despite initial resistance, the locals agreed to transfer the monkey to the Foundation's custody. Investigation reports indicate that the monkey has an innate ability to locate faults in electrical systems, analyze them, and proffer fast, reliable solutions.

Personnel are to exercise extreme caution when handling the monkey, as it has been known to display sudden bouts of aggression. This behavior may be linked to the monkey's profound attachment to electrical gadgets and tools, which must have been an influence of unknown origins. Under no circumstances should Item #2301 be allowed to roam freely, as this could lead to severe damage and potential health risks to Foundation personnel.

Overall, Item #2301 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation, especially as it provides insight into the development of animal intelligence and its impact on society. Further research is ongoing to investigate if Project LACONIC can facilitate any other potential use cases for the monkey.
