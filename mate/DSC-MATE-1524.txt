Item #: 1524

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1524 poses no immediate threat to the facility or its inhabitants. Their access to the outside world shall be allowed provided that they maintain regular check-ins with designated personnel. Under no circumstances shall Subject 1524 be given access to classified information.

Description: Subject is a humanoid male of average height and weight, with short brown hair and green eyes. They can be identified by the jade earrings on each ear, a gold chain around their neck, and a two-color band decorating their forehead. They wear a peak cap with goggles resting atop. They are often seen smoking a cigarette.

Personality: Subject 1524 is highly observant and astute. They pay meticulous attention to detail, making them an excellent gifter. However, this trait can also manifest as over-concern with pleasing others, leading them to spend extensive amounts of time searching for that "perfect" gift. This behavior can lead to increased stress levels, often displayed through their anxious tick of flicking their cigarette. 

Subject 1524 serves as the theater manager for the local performing arts center, with no reported anomalies. Inter-personal interactions appear to have a calming effect on Subject 1524, stemming from their love for theater and performance.

Addendum: 1524 was recently reported to be observed slipping unauthorized notes into performers' hands before their appearance on stage. The contents of notes remain unknown, but it is speculated that Subject 1524 may be attempting to alter the course of the performance. Research on this matter is pending.
