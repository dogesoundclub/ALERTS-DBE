Item #: SCP-6472

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6472 was successfully contained at Site ██ before its neutralization. Any further sightings or reports of SCP-6472 should be immediately reported to Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-6472 was a human female of unknown age, identified as a security guard working on Site ██. SCP-6472 was notable for its purple lip, normal glasses, and orange hair styled to one side. SCP-6472 was always seen wearing a medical mask and a choker as accessories.

SCP-6472 was observed to have a friendly and social personality. It valued harmony and social connections, and was known to engage in playful banter and tell jokes with others. This goofy side often resulted in humorous situations, which made SCP-6472 popular among its colleagues.

Despite its benign nature, SCP-6472 was found to have an anomalous effect on those who interacted with it. Subjects reported feeling a sense of lightheadedness and euphoria when in SCP-6472's presence, which could result in altered judgement and behavior.

SCP-6472 was neutralized after Foundation investigation revealed that its anomalous effect was the result of an unknown chemical agent that it had unknowingly ingested. The source of the agent could not be identified, and attempts to recreate the effect have been unsuccessful. SCP-6472 was deemed no longer anomalous and is no longer under Foundation containment.
