Item #: 7136

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7136 is to be stationed at Site-17's veterinary department where they can serve as a veterinarian for any animals that may require medical attention. They are not to be allowed to treat any humanoid SCPs without proper clearance from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7136 is a human male, approximately 35 years of age. They stand at 180 cm in height and weigh 76kg. They have blue clown eyes that are the result of a genetic mutation, which has no negative effect on their vision or overall health. SCP-7136 is often seen wearing a police cap and a goggle on their forehead. They also sport a green cross earring on their left ear and smoke cigarettes throughout the day.

SCP-7136 is well-known for their sharp wit and love of debate. They exhibit a playful personality and often engage in lighthearted arguments with friends and family. This personality trait has been noted to help defuse tense situations when dealing with stress or hostility. However, it can also lead to some unprofessional behavior in the workplace, particularly when SCP-7136 encounters clients whose opinions differ from their own.

SCP-7136 is a licensed veterinarian and has demonstrated a deep understanding of animal biology and behavior. They have an innate talent for animal care and are particularly skilled at treating animals with complex medical needs. SCP-7136 is also knowledgeable in the management of some anomalous animal species, making them an important asset to the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-7136 has expressed interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with Assistant Researcher Juliette (Item #: 8150), which has been denied upon consideration of the site's non-fraternization protocols. SCP-7136 continues to express disappointment but has shown no indication of compromising the site's security or safety.
