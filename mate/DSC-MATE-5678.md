Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5678 is to be kept under surveillance for any signs of erratic or potentially dangerous behavior. Under no circumstances should she be given access to any advanced technologies or weaponry, as her unusual appearance and resistance to authority could make her a liability in combat situations. All interactions with subject 5678 must be conducted with extreme caution.

Description: Subject 5678 appears to be a young human female in her early twenties, with an unusual appearance that includes a traditional 00s school girl outfit and a striking set of jade earrings. She is known to wear a normal gas mask at all times, regardless of any potential health hazards she may face. Her personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and a rebellious streak that can cause her to disobey orders or engage in potentially dangerous activities without warning.

Personality: Despite her relatively harmless appearance, subject 5678 has proven to be a difficult personality to accurately predict or control. Her rebellious tendencies can lead to instances of insubordination or disobedience, making her a difficult subject to work with in group settings. Nevertheless, she has also proven to possess a strong sense of loyalty to those she trusts, and can be an asset in tight-knit teams if properly managed.

Additional Notes: Subject 5678's preference for gas masks and her 00s school girl appearance suggests that she may have some sort of psychological traumas or hang-ups stemming from experiences during that era. Additionally, her jade earrings are believed to have some cultural or symbolic significance, but further research is required to accurately ascertain their meaning.
