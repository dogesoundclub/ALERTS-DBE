Item #: SCP-2951

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2951 is to be employed as a security guard at all times to ensure the safekeeping of our facility. They are to be monitored closely for any unusual behavior or activities that may pose a threat to our operations. Any abnormalities should be reported immediately to the overseeing Site Director.

Description: SCP-2951 is a female human, seemingly in their late 20s or early 30s, with distinct physical features. They have full lips painted in red lipstick, a hairstyle reminiscent of the 00s school girl fashion, and gold earrings adorning their ears. However, it is their personality that has proven to be of interest to Foundation researchers.

SCP-2951 is highly detail-oriented and exhibits obsessive-compulsive tendencies, mostly centered around the organization of their possessions. They have been observed alphabetizing their spice rack and color-coding their wardrobe. Though these quirks may seem harmless, they may signify an underlying obsession with control and order that could have negative implications if left unchecked.

As a result, SCP-2951 has been assigned to the position of security guard. This allows them to channel their need for order and control towards the protection of the Foundation's assets. They have proven to be an asset to our organization, diligently carrying out their duties and keeping our facility secure.

As of yet, no anomalous activity has been detected in SCP-2951. However, given the nature of our work, continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure their stability and prevent any potential incidents.
