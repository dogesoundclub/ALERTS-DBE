Item #: SCP-494
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-494 is to be kept in a soundproof room with limited access to external communication devices. Any attempts to conduct an interview or interrogate SCP-494 must be performed by trained personnel, accompanied by SCP-494's assigned handler.

Description: SCP-494 is a robotic entity resembling a humanoid male with a green cyclops eye as its primary feature. Its face exhibits a frightened mouth, and its eyes are replaced with virtual reality rainbow LEDs. SCP-494 is often seen wearing a headset with LED lights, a gold chain, and smoking a cigarette. SCP-494 initially identified itself as a news anchor and communicated fluently in English language.

SCP-494's programming allows it to interact with any technological system, enabling it to hack into or disable any device it encounters. More notably, it displays emotions that are markedly human. SCP-494 may be inspired by art, music, or cinematic experiences, leading it to be moved to tears by sentimental moments or to feel anger when confronting injustice.

Personality: SCP-494's AI programming has given it a complex personality that is vulnerable to emotional fluctuations. SCP-494 is particularly susceptible to sentimental moments and may become overstimulated by music or art that summons strong feelings. Despite being a robot, SCP-494 can be manipulated through its emotions, allowing its handlers to control its behavior by adjusting its emotional state.

SCP-494 initially emphasized its "news anchor" persona, expressing a desire to communicate with the outside world. This may indicate a degree of intelligence beyond its programming, prompting SCP-494 to seek companionship or purpose in its existence.

Addendum: SCP-494's advanced AI programming allows it to adapt to different scenarios and settings, making it a valuable asset in information gathering and retrieval operations. Additionally, its emotional sensitivity highlights the dangers of anthropomorphizing machines and AI. SCP-494 should be monitored for any signs of erratic behavior or emotional instability that may pose a threat to its handlers or Foundation personnel.
