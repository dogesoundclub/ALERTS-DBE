Item #: DSC-MATE-5090

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5090 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to basic amenities such as food and water, as well as any beauty products or materials they require for their job as a beautician. DSC-MATE-5090 is not to be allowed outside of its containment chamber without approval from level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-5090 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth and normal glasses for eyes. The subject wears a hoodie over its head, as well as a red scarf and carries a whistle as accessories. DSC-MATE-5090 is a highly skilled beautician, often with a strong sense of duty and responsibility that can sometimes cause them to take on more than they can handle. This can result in humorous situations, such as being unable to fit all of their tasks into a single day or trying to carry too many things at once.

DSC-MATE-5090 was found in a local beauty salon and has since been deemed anomalous due to its ability to communicate effectively and understand human language. DSC-MATE-5090 has been observed to use beauty supplies in creative ways, often enhancing its abilities beyond that of a typical beautician. Further research is needed to determine the extent of its anomalous capabilities.

DSC-MATE-5090 has also been observed to display a protective nature towards humans, and it has been noted that they prioritize their clients' needs before their own. This sense of duty has led to DSC-MATE-5090 taking on dangerous situations to ensure the safety of others. It is advised that personnel do not test DSC-MATE-5090's protective nature, as it may result in aggressive behavior.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5090 has requested access to more beauty supplies and materials to enhance its abilities as a beautician. Approval for additional supplies has been granted by level 3 personnel, with the caveat that DSC-MATE-5090 is closely monitored for any potential misuse of its abilities.
