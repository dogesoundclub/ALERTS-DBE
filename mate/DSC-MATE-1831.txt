Item #: SCP-1831

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1831 is to be contained in a standard humanoid holding cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-1831 is authorized with Level 2 security clearance and is to be accompanied by at least one guard for all interactions.

Description: SCP-1831 is a male robotic entity resembling a human car salesman. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds. SCP-1831's face features a single green cyclops eye and a constantly frightened mouth.

Its head is adorned with green hair, a purple cap, and horned rim glasses. SCP-1831's ears are pierced with a jade earring, and it wears a silver chain around its neck with a whistle attached.

SCP-1831 has a laid-back and easy-going personality, but it is fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. It has been observed engaging in heated arguments with individuals who insulted its friends or family members, leading to humorous situations.

SCP-1831 is capable of performing tasks typically associated with a car salesman, including selling cars, negotiating prices, and arranging test drives. However, it has displayed an unusual level of attachment to the vehicles in its inventory, often referring to them by name and showing distress when they are sold.

SCP-1831's origins are unknown, and attempts to identify its creator or manufacturer have been unsuccessful. It appears to be powered by a self-sustaining mechanism that requires no external energy source. No anomalous properties have been detected in SCP-1831's technology or construction.

Addendum: During routine testing, SCP-1831 was exposed to a high level of electromagnetic radiation. Following exposure, SCP-1831 displayed a brief period of increased aggression and hostility. Further experimentation with electromagnetic radiation exposure is forbidden without approval from at least two Level 4 personnel.
