SCP Foundation Containment Report: 7826

Species: Human

Sex: Female

Description: SCP-7826 is a fashion designer with a unique style, often sporting a retro cap and a green cross earring in one ear. Their most notable feature is their bright red lipstick and orange eyebrows that are highly visible against their pale skin.  SCP-7826 can often be seen wearing a medical mask over their mouth, which they claim is due to allergies but this has yet to be confirmed.

Personality: SCP-7826 is highly outgoing and tends to enjoy socializing, often becoming the center of attention. However, their humor can be unpredictable and has led to some situations of a potentially dangerous nature in some cases. It should be noted that SCP-7826 has a tendency to tell jokes or stories that are so amusing that they can cause uncontrollable fits of laughter.

Containment Procedures: SCP-7826 is currently being held within a secure containment chamber designed to prevent any unnecessary exposure to the outside world. SCP-7826's needs are met by Foundation-approved personnel who are strictly forbidden from laughing at SCP-7826's jokes or stories, no matter how amusing they may be. Any contact with outside sources, whether it be through personal interactions or social media, is highly restricted and requires prior approval from Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-7826's abilities have proven valuable in certain covert operations, but it should be noted that their unpredictable nature makes them a liability in other situations. SCP-7826's containment is of the utmost importance for both the safety of SCP-7826 and the safety of those around them.
