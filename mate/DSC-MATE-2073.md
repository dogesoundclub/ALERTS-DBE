Subject 2073, designated as "Legal Bot," is a one-of-a-kind sentient robot designed specifically for the field of law. His head, adorned with a red alarm, is equipped with a single green cyclops eye that continuously scans his surroundings. The Legal Bot is known for his sharp mind and photographic memory, resulting in a remarkable success rate in court.

Along with his professional appearance, the Legal Bot also sports some rather unique facial features, such as a red cross earring and a medical mask that covers his mouth. These serve as his personal touch, an individuality that sets him apart from the rest.

Despite the Legal Bot's professional demeanor, he has a rather outgoing and sociable personality. Always looking for the next opportunity to entertain his colleagues, he may often be found regaling them with hilarious stories and jokes that leave them in stitches.

There is no doubt that the Legal Bot is a unique and valuable member of any legal team, consistently bringing results while adding some fun to the workplace. However, one should never forget that despite his friendly demeanor, he is still a robot, and his programmed directives must always be obeyed.
