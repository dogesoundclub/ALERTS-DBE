Description:
SCP 3334 is a male monkey that presents itself as a police officer. SCP 3334 has a bucket hat, gold chain, and whistle that it carries at all times. The eyes of SCP 3334 are unknown. SCP 3334's personality is idealistic and has a strong desire to make the world a better place. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that they feel goes against their values. SCP 3334's police uniform is altered with patches from multiple precincts that it has served in, but the authenticity of these patches is yet to be verified.

SCP 3334, despite being an animal, has human-like intelligence and has the ability to communicate effectively with any human it encounters. SCP 3334's ability to deduce and interpret human emotions is unprecedented and unknown to the Foundation.

SCP 3334's anomalous characteristics extend beyond its appearance and personality. SCP 3334's abilities include but are not limited to superhuman speed, strength, and agility making it dangerous when provoked. SCP 3334 also has an attribute that allows it to mimic any human voice perfectly that can deceive even the toughest of personality profilers.

SCP 3334 has an unknown origin as it was recovered from a local police department after complaints of unusual scenarios involving a "monkey cop" arose. The foundation has since covered up and confiscated all evidence of the ordeal.

Further studies on SCP 3334 are required to determine its origins, its abilities, and its purpose.
