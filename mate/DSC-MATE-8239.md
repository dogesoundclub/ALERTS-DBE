Item #: DSC-MATE-8239

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8239 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-8239 must wear Level 3 protective gear and gas masks to prevent contamination. DSC-MATE-8239's access to inanimate objects and household appliances must be limited and controlled to prevent any potential anomalous effects.

Description: DSC-MATE-8239 is a male fashion designer with spots on his face and frightened mouth. He sports a pair of red clown eyes, a short peak cap on his head, and a green cross earring on each ear. He wears a gold chain around his neck and carries a normal gas mask as his main accessory. Despite his unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-8239 is a human.

DSC-MATE-8239 exhibits an anomalous ability to care for and nurture inanimate objects such as cars, plants, and appliances. He anthropomorphizes them, giving them names and talking to them as if they were living beings. This behavior has resulted in unintended anomalous effects in the past, leading to the containment of DSC-MATE-8239.

DSC-MATE-8239 interacts with his surroundings as if they were alive, believing that his care for them can improve their performance and longevity. Any inanimate objects given a name by DSC-MATE-8239 have been observed to display a degree of autonomy and movement, albeit limited to simple tasks such as opening and closing doors or turning lights on and off.

DSC-MATE-8239's tendency to anthropomorphize his environment makes him prone to attachment to inanimate objects, leading to difficulty separating or isolating him from them. Careful observation and control are therefore needed to prevent anomalous effects from manifesting.

Personality: Despite DSC-MATE-8239's anomalous abilities, he exhibits a caring and nurturing personality towards both animate and inanimate objects. He is amiable and sociable, behaving as if objects are alive and capable of interacting with him. His behavior stems from the belief that his care and attention can improve their performance and prolong their lifespan. Although DSC-MATE-8239's behavior is often harmless, it can lead to accidental anomalous effects that can have detrimental consequences.
