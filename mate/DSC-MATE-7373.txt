Item #: SCP-7373

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7373 is to be kept under observation within his designated quarters at Site-██. Access to the media is to be limited and monitored at all times. Personnel are not to engage in discussion with SCP-7373 about personal issues or to provide any aid or advice. In case of a public appearance, all communication is to be carefully crafted and reviewed by relevant authority.

Description: SCP-7373 is a humanoid entity identified as a male human, appearing in his early thirties. He has pink, parted hair and wears normal glasses. SCP-7373 can be identified by his gold earring and a red scarf. It was first discovered when his empathetic nature drew the attention of the Foundation after several anomalous incidents occurred around him.

SCP-7373 works as a news anchor in its hometown local news station. His compassionate nature has made him very popular among his viewers, as they appreciate his willingness to listen to both sides of the story. SCP-7373 has strong emotions where he can feel empathy poignantly towards others. However, this can lead to him taking on the emotions of the people he interacts with. This has led to several incidents where SCP-7373's emotional state had unexpected anomalies.

Reports from his co-workers at the news station have noted that SCP-7373 has tried to help each of them with their personal issues. While his intent is noble, it leads to an echo effect causing severe emotional distress and unexpected effects. Based on the data collected, SCP-7373's actions can be classified under the "SCP syndrome."

Addendum: Based on the data, research has concluded that SCP-7373's abilities cannot be controlled, and all external interactions with SCP-7373 are to be limited. Meanwhile, the search for a possible cure is underway. Until then, caution and strict observation are to be maintained.
