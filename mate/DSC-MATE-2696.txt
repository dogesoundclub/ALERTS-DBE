SCP-2696, also known as "The Jester," is a human female of an unknown age with unique features. She has blonde hair that seems to defy gravity, and instead of normal ears, she has a pair of red cross earrings. Her most distinctive feature are the orange stripes that run across her face, giving her a rather clownish appearance. Her eyes are a mesmerizing deep red color and are akin to the eyes of a circus performer. A pair of wings sprouts from her head, which unlike most fairy-tale creatures, are not delicate and feathery, but are instead a horrific representation of bat-like wings covered in patches of fur. 

SCP-2696 is often seen wearing a silver chain on her neck, which hangs down her chest, further enhancing her bizarre appearance. The Jester is known for her great sense of humor, which she uses to make others laugh. Sometimes, she shares funny stories or does silly impersonations to lighten the mood. However, she is known to be a bit of a mischief-maker, so care is required when dealing with her. 

SCP-2696 is currently assigned as a mechanic at Site-19, where she can put her unusual talents to good use. She is capable of repairing almost any machine, no matter how damaged it is. She also seems to have an innate ability to modify devices to have unexpected features. These modifications are only to occur under close supervision, and all modified objects should be referred to the safety team before use. 

SCP-2696 has generally shown good temperament and poses little danger to Foundation personnel. However, caution should always be taken around her as she often likes to play jokes and pranks. Any anomalies in her behavior should be immediately reported to her handlers.
