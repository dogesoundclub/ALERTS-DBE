Item #: 1105

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1105 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber with modified ventilation to accommodate for its respiratory system. All staff interacting with SCP-1105 must wear appropriate personal protective equipment to avoid inhaling allergens or pathogens. It is also recommended that staff interact with SCP-1105 only after undergoing immunotherapy for common rabbit allergens.

Description: SCP-1105 appears to be a male rabbit, standing approximately 0.3 meters tall with green fur. The subject has a frightened mouth and wears nerd glasses in front of its eyes. The head of SCP-1105 is not arranged and its fur is green. The subject wears a gold chain around its neck and a normal gas mask.

SCP-1105 possesses a unique ability to communicate with other animals, specifically other rabbits. It has displayed an exceptional ability to diagnose and treat ailments in various animal species, despite its limited knowledge of conventional veterinary medicine.

SCP-1105 has a goofy and lighthearted personality, often telling jokes and engaging in playful banter with staff and other SCPs. It values social connections and harmony, which has contributed to its success as a veterinarian.

SCP-1105 is not inherently dangerous, but its respiratory system is sensitive to allergens and pathogens commonly found in the environment. As such, it must be carefully monitored to prevent respiratory distress or other adverse health effects.

Addendum: SCP-1105 has expressed a desire to form a peacekeeping team comprised of anomalous animals for the betterment of society. This proposal is currently under review by O5 Council.
