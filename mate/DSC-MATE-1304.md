Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1304 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber with basic amenities. Any requests for additional items must be approved by level 2 personnel or higher. All interactions with DSC-MATE-1304 should be conducted by Level 1 personnel or higher with proper clearance. Researchers are advised to wear gloves and face protection when conducting tests due to DSC-MATE-1304's unpredictable behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-1304 is a male monkey that appears to be a hybrid of several primate species. DSC-MATE-1304 displays unusual anatomical features such as ski goggle eyes and a retro cap. DSC-MATE-1304 also has a gold earring on one of its ears.

DSC-MATE-1304's most distinctive feature is its frightened mouth. It constantly appears as if DSC-MATE-1304 is in a state of fear or agitation. This feature often leads to personnel underestimating DSC-MATE-1304's intelligence levels.

DSC-MATE-1304 has been observed to have an organized and efficient personality, often taking charge of group projects or events. This behavior can come across as exceedingly controlling, leading to humorous situations where DSC-MATE-1304 delegates tasks in a matter-of-fact way.

DSC-MATE-1304 currently works as a theater manager, likely due to its ability to lead and organize tasks efficiently. Despite its efficient and organized personality, DSC-MATE-1304's erratic behavior makes it difficult to predict its actions accurately.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1304's fear response appears to be triggered by eye contact. Test results indicate that DSC-MATE-1304's fear response is not caused by a direct threat to its safety. Therefore, eye contact should be avoided during interactions with DSC-MATE-1304 to prevent a potential containment breach.
