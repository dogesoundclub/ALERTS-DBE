Item #: SCP-5073

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5073 is currently contained at Site-███, and is to be monitored at all times by security personnel. Access to SCP-5073 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-5073 is to be provided with a daily routine of physical and mental exercises to prevent any outbreaks of enthusiasm, and must wear a medical mask at all times to prevent any potential outbreaks of infectious spores.

Description: SCP-5073 appears to be a female human security guard with several unusual physical features. SCP-5073's face is covered with several spots, and her eyes have been noted to be bright orange color, with her eyebrows being of the same color. SCP-5073's head seems to resemble that of a pink rabbit, with her ears adorned with gold earrings. SCP-5073 wears a silver chain around her neck.

SCP-5073's most notable feature is her exuberant and enthusiastic personality. SCP-5073 often displays an abundance of energy and may cause others to feel the same. As such, SCP-5073 is prone to getting overly excited about mundane things, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-5073's enthusiasm is contagious and can cause other personnel to become infected with heightened positivity.

SCP-5073 has been known to release infectious spores when excited, which can cause those around her to become infected with the same positivity. Extreme cases of exposure to SCP-5073 have led to permanent changes to the affected individual's personality, including increased enthusiasm and decreased inhibitions.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5073's infectious nature, all personnel are advised to maintain a distance of at least three meters from the subject at all times. In case of exposure, a thorough decontamination process must be followed to prevent the spread of infectious spores. Any personnel displaying signs of permanent personality changes are to be isolated and studied as possible Class B or C SCP entities.
