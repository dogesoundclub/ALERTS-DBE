Special Containment Procedures: Subject, identified as Officer 8885, is to be contained within a standard containment locker at Site-██. The monkey species of this subject is not to be revealed outside of approved personnel.

Description: Officer 8885 is a male monkey approximately 3 feet in height. The subject is characterized by its frightened mouth and horned rim glasses over its dark brown eyes. The head of the subject is often adorned with a blue bandana and a single jade earring on its right ear.

Officer 8885 is often seen wearing a gold chain as its accessory, which it seems particularly fond of. However, its most significant accessory is a normal gas mask for its protection.

The subject has a unique personality, often shown by its tendency to be impulsive and take risks, sometimes leading to humorous situations. Its behavior is similar to that of a wild monkey rather than an organized police officer.

Addendum 8885-01: Despite the unpredictable nature of the subject's behavior, Officer 8885 has been a valuable asset in the field, often used for undercover operations in high-risk situations. The subject's physical agility and small size make it exceptionally useful in situations where other human officers would have difficulty infiltrating.

Addendum 8885-02: Officer 8885's species origin remains unknown, as there have been no recorded cases of monkey-human hybridization. Further investigation is required.
