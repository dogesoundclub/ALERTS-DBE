Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3194 is to be contained in a standard primate containment chamber with access to fresh fruit and water at all times. DSC-MATE-3194 is to be monitored by security personnel at all times to prevent unauthorized access to its containment area.

Description: DSC-MATE-3194 is a male primate of the species Macaca mulatta, commonly known as the rhesus macaque. DSC-MATE-3194 displays a frightened mouth as its primary facial feature and wears a doge hat as its headgear. DSC-MATE-3194 also wears a silver chain necklace and a standard gas mask.

DSC-MATE-3194 exhibits a highly organized personality and usually plans its activities in advance. However, DSC-MATE-3194 also has a spontaneous side, which can sometimes lead to humorous situations. DSC-MATE-3194 tends to surprise its friends with last-minute party planning and impromptu adventures that turn out to be popular with its companions.

DSC-MATE-3194 currently works as a banker and has access to financial resources that could prove useful to the Foundation's operations. However, DSC-MATE-3194's status as a primate precludes its involvement in banking activities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3194 has occasionally demonstrated an ability to communicate telepathically with other primates, though the extent of its telepathic abilities is still unknown. Further study is needed to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-3194's anomalous properties.
