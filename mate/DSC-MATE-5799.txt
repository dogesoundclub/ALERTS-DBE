Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5799 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell must be equipped with a soundproofing system to prevent SCP-5799 from disrupting the peace of other Foundation personnel. Food must be provided to SCP-5799 twice a day, with one hour of exercise between meals. Interaction with SCP-5799 is permitted for research purposes, but must be overseen by at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-5799 is a rabbit-humanoid hybrid of male gender, measuring at 1.5m in height. SCP-5799 expresses itself through normal glasses that discreetly cover its hazel-colored eyes. SCP-5799 is often seen wearing a "Doge" hat, which resembles the popular internet meme of the same name. SCP-5799 also dons a gold chain accessory around its neck.

SCP-5799's personality is characterized by its great sense of humor, often deriving pleasure from making others laugh. SCP-5799's humor may lead to situations that are deemed out of place, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations. Foundation personnel should remain vigilant of SCP-5799's humorous tendencies, as they may be a guise to manipulate others for nefarious purposes.
