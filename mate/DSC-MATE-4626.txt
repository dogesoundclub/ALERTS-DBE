Item #: SCP-4626

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4626 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a ventilation system designed to accommodate SCP-4626's species. The chamber should be furnished with a desk, a medical kit, and a typewriter. SCP-4626 must be given access to books and other reading material at all times. Smoking is strictly prohibited within the containment chamber.

SCP-4626 is only to be removed from its chamber for medical purposes or for provision of medical aid to staff or other SCPs. Before it is allowed to interact with any other living creature, it must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation.

Description: SCP-4626 is a male European rabbit with a frightened mouth and a doge hat on its head. It is known to be a licensed medical doctor, with considerable knowledge of both conventional and anomalous medicine.

SCP-4626 is known to possess a red victory band on its forehead and is generally found smoking a cigarette. It exhibits remarkable empathy and compassion for all creatures, anomalous and otherwise. Its desire to help others, however, may lead to it taking on more than it can handle, leading to mental and physical exhaustion.

SCP-4626 is capable of communicating in all known human languages, but prefers to write its observations and opinions on a typewriter or notebook. It has been noted that SCP-4626 has a tendency to become deeply attached to its patients, leading to it developing a desire to save their lives regardless of the cost.

Currently, SCP-4626 is kept on a strict regimen of medication, therapy, and other medical treatments to prevent it from overworking and to improve its mental stability.

Addendum: SCP-4626 has been observed to have a healing aura around it, which provides a soothing effect to all creatures in its vicinity. This behavior has yet to be fully understood by the Foundation, and further research is needed.
