Item #: 9051

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9051 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to any fashion-related materials or media must be strictly prohibited for SCP-9051. All personnel interacting with SCP-9051 must wear earplugs to prevent exposure to its auditory hallucinations.

Description: SCP-9051 is a humanoid creature in the form of a human female, measuring approximately 1.73 meters in height and weighing 62 kilograms. It possesses several unique physical features, including orange stripes on its face, red clown eyes, and a purple cap with a headset. Its mouth is typically concealed behind a medical mask, and it wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-9051's most notable characteristic is its ability to generate a constant stream of creative ideas. It is an accomplished fashion designer and has produced several striking pieces that have become increasingly popular in recent years. Its personality is marked by a natural inclination towards brainstorming and it enjoys suggesting alternative solutions to problems just for the sake of seeing reactions from others.

Despite its harmless demeanor, SCP-9051 has demonstrated the ability to produce auditory hallucinations in those in close proximity to it. These hallucinations often revolve around fashion and design, and have been known to cause disorientation and confusion in some individuals.

Addendum: SCP-9051 was recovered by Foundation agents following reports of a "fashion guru" displaying abnormal behavior in several major cities. Its true nature was discovered after several individuals began to exhibit symptoms consistent with SCP-9051's auditory hallucinations. The entity quickly surrendered itself once approached by Foundation agents and has been contained ever since.
