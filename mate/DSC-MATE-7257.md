DSC-MATE-7257's gas mask appears to be non-anomalous and is used by DSC-MATE-7257 to protect its respiratory system from various environmental hazards. However, it is unknown why DSC-MATE-7257 wears it at all times and refuses to remove it during interactions with Foundation personnel.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7257 has expressed interest in creating mechanized devices which would aid in the containment of other DSC objects. These ideas have been denied by Foundation personnel, as DSC-MATE-7257's tendencies towards humor and unpredictability are deemed too high-risk to incorporate into Foundation containment methods.
