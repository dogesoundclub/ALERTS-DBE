Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3448 is to be monitored at all times by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-3448 is a middle-aged human male with notable orange stripes on their facial features. SCP-3448's mouth is constantly in a frightened expression, causing difficulties for facial recognition software. SCP-3448's eyes require corrective lenses in the form of normal glasses that do not impact their observations or capabilities. SCP-3448's hair is parted in a pink hue and appears to be in constant disarray.

SCP-3448 possesses an LED gas mask, which they use to control conversations and situations to their advantage. SCP-3448 exerts an aura of natural charm and charisma, which can cause them to be the life of the party, regardless of any other factors. SCP-3448 is known to engage in humorous behaviour such as telling jokes or performing silly dances to make others laugh. Following their anomalous properties, SCP-3448's success in politics was aided by their strange charm.

Addendum: Investigation into the anomalous effects of SCP-3448's natural charm and charisma are ongoing. Researchers are to identify and locate any associated groups, phenomena, or entities linked to SCP-3448.
