Item #: 1288

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its anomalous nature, 1288 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents disguised as ordinary customers. 1288 is not to be approached by any means unless necessary, as it may cause dangerous behavior. Any unusual activity by 1288 must be immediately reported to the nearest Foundation site for further investigation.

Description: 1288 is a Human female of average height and weight. Its most striking feature is its Red Clown Eyes, which glow unnaturally bright at night. 1288's head hair is Green with Edge Curl, and it is often seen wearing a Medical Mask over its mouth.  Its ears are adorned with Golden Earrings, and it often wears a Choker around its neck.

1288's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and rebelliousness. It is often resistant to authority and may engage in sneaky behavior, such as leaving work early or taking a day off without permission. It is believed that 1288's anomalous properties may be related to its personality and that it may have a limited degree of control over reality.

Addendum: 1288 was discovered by Foundation agents after reports of a strange delivery driver who seemed to disappear and appear out of nowhere. It is suspected that 1288 has the ability to teleport short distances, and we are still trying to determine the extent of this ability. Further investigation is required to fully understand the scope of 1288's capabilities.
