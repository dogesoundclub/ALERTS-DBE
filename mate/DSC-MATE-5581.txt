Item #: SCP-5581

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5581 is to be contained in a standard holding chamber suitable for simian species. The chamber must be equipped with tight security measures to prevent unauthorized entry. SCP-5581 is to be provided with a balanced diet and provided with enrichment tools for psychological health.

SCP-5581 must be constantly monitored by two security guards in the presence of any individual or group who wish to enter the containment chamber. During such events, SCP-5581 must be restrained and equipped with a muzzle and handcuffs.

Description: SCP-5581 is a male monkey of the Macaca species with predominantly brown fur. SCP-5581 has a terrified facial expression on his small face. Its red clown eyes and a bucket hat on its head make it stand out from other male monkeys of the same species.

SCP-5581 has a unique pattern of two-colored bands on its forehead. Along with a red scarf around its neck and a whistle on his chest, SCP-5581 appears to be a security guard for an unseen higher authority.

SCP-5581 exhibits a personality that is highly unusual for its species. It has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which appears to be the result of its training as a security guard. Nevertheless, SCP-5581 also has a highly developed sense of humor and is often seen engaging in humorous antics and dance moves. Its ability to let loose and have fun is at odds with its highly disciplined professional side.

SCP-5581 is highly proficient in its duties and carries them out with great skill and precision. SCP-5581 is also highly intelligent, and its high adaptability to changing environments makes it highly coveted by higher authorities.

Addendum: SCP-5581 was successfully recruited by the Foundation's security team after gaining clearance from an unknown higher authority. SCP-5581 has proved to be a highly efficient security guard, displaying remarkable strength, agility, and intelligence. However, SCP-5581 must be constantly monitored, as its ability to surprise others with humorous antics and dance moves could be a potential security risk. Therefore, the Foundation has assigned a strict regime of psychological and behavior assessment for SCP-5581.
