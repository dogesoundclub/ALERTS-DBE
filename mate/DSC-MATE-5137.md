Item #: DSC-MATE-5137

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5137 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. DSC-MATE-5137's LED gas mask must be kept operational at all times and is not to be removed under any circumstances. All interactions with DSC-MATE-5137 must be conducted via video and audio communication systems for safety purposes.

Description: DSC-MATE-5137 appears to be a female human in her mid-30s with distinct spots on her face and a smile that never fades. DSC-MATE-5137's normal glasses cover her typical human eyes, but her witch short haircut and jade earrings give her a distinct appearance. Also, the subject has two color bands running across her forehead and a gold chain around her neck.

DSC-MATE-5137 exhibits a personality that can be impulsive and prone to acting on emotions without thinking things through. This trait can lead to some amusing situations in which DSC-MATE-5137 makes spontaneous decisions that others may find humorous or surprising. Despite this eccentric personality, DSC-MATE-5137 has continued working as a banker, remaining undiscovered by the public thus far.

DSC-MATE-5137's most significant anomaly is the LED gas mask it wears at all times. Without the mask, DSC-MATE-5137 emits a toxic gas that induces hysteria and hallucinations in those exposed to it. The gas is so potent that without the mask, it would likely affect DSC-MATE-5137 itself, leading to a catastrophic event.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5137 was discovered in [REDACTED], where it had caused a mass hysteria event that resulted in several casualties. DSC agents quickly intervened and contained the subject. It is unknown how DSC-MATE-5137 obtained its anomalous properties. Further research is ongoing.
