Special Containment Procedures: Subject 843 is to be contained in a specialized medical facility, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for research and treatment purposes.

Description: Subject 843 is a human male, standing at 6 feet tall with a lean, muscular build. His head is covered in thick, layered green hair, and he sports a pair of nerdy glasses that seem to magnify his glare. His left ear is adorned with a jade earring, while a silver chain hangs around his neck. Subject 843 is often seen wearing a medical mask over his mouth and chin, and has a peculiar dark spot on his mouth that serves as a unique identifying feature.

While Subject 843 does not exhibit any overtly anomalous traits, his personality is notably eccentric. He has a dry, deadpan sense of humor that often catches people off guard, and his sharp tongue can leave even the most unsuspecting individuals reeling. Despite his seemingly aloof demeanor, Subject 843 is highly intelligent and analytical, able to quickly assess a situation and apply a logical approach to solving problems.

Addendum: Subject 843 has been observed to display symptoms of various infectious diseases, despite having no apparent history of exposure. As such, his containment must be strictly enforced, and any interaction with him must be carried out with the utmost caution. Further research into the source of his infections is ongoing.
