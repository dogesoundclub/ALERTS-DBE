SCP Classified File #9070: The Train Driver

Identification number 9070 designates a female human train driver, whose unique appearance may trigger initial discomfort in some individuals. With vivid red clown eyes that seem to peer into one's soul, this SCP-9070's head is often covered with a bucket hat, hiding her facial expressions from onlookers.

Despite showing no anomalous abilities or behaviors, SCP-9070's green cross earring and choker accessory suggest some form of affiliation with a specialized group or organization. Further research is required in this regard.

SCP-9070's introspective and imaginative nature is the most notable feature of her personality. Often lost in her thoughts, SCP-9070 can experience moments of clumsiness and accidents, damaging equipment or causing minor injuries to herself.

SCP-9070's mundane job as a train driver does not indicate any apparent relation to her anomalous traits. However, further examination could provide additional insight into her psychological state, enabling future containment procedures to be developed with greater efficacy.

The Foundation will continue to monitor SCP-9070's actions and behavior, evaluating and updating its protocols accordingly. Any interaction with the outside world should be undertaken with caution to maintain the veil of normalcy, preventing additional complications that could arise from SCP-9070's unusual appearance and quirks.
