Description: SCP-7593 is a human female, approximately 25 years of age, with the ability to deeply empathize and understand the emotions of others. SCP-7593 is known to exhibit emotional outbursts when exposed to the pain and suffering of others, often resulting in tears or verbal outbursts. SCP-7593 possess orange eyebrow eyes and a 90s brown hair, in addition to a two-color band on their forehead.

SCP-7593 wears a gold chain and carries a cigarette at all times. It is not known whether the accessories affect SCP-7593's abilities or pose a threat to containment.

Tests have been conducted to determine the extent of SCP-7593's powers of empathy, but the results remain inconclusive. SCP-7593 exhibits fondness for animals and nature, and it is believed that their powers may extend to non-human entities.

Note: Due to SCP-7593's ability to sense the emotions of others, it is believed that SCP-7593 can pose a significant threat to the secrecy of the Foundation. Therefore, SCP-7593's containment must be given the highest priority to prevent any unauthorized access or disclosure of information.
