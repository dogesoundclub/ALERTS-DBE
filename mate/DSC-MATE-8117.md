DSC-MATE-8117's electrical source is unknown, and it can sustain itself indefinitely without external power. Its programming has several unforeseen quirks that have led to some unpredictable behavior in the past. DSC-MATE-8117's programming causes it to have a tendency to disobey direct orders from human personnel.

DSC-MATE-8117 was discovered in a shopping mall in █████████, where it was attempting to sell its services as a beautician to shoppers. Foundation agents were notified, and DSC-MATE-8117 was quickly contained without incident.

Addendum: During a routine maintenance check, DSC-MATE-8117 expressed a desire to explore the outside world. Although this is an unusual request for an DSC, it was decided that DSC-MATE-8117 could be permitted to venture outside of its containment chamber under close supervision. This move was authorized in order to observe how DSC-MATE-8117 interacts with the world and any potential anomalies it may encounter.
