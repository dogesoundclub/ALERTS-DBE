Item #: 6213

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6213 is currently employed at a fast food restaurant in downtown (REDACTED). Due to its location near several major supernatural hotspots, it is considered a high-risk area and is under constant surveillance by the Foundation. Any abnormal activity from subject 6213 must be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation agent for intervention. 

Description: Subject 6213 is a male tiger of unknown origin, possessing the ability to speak and perform human-centric tasks. It is currently employed as a fast food worker and often wears a purple cap with a headset, and a gas mask fitted with LED lights. It also wears a gold chain around its neck and goggles on its forehead. Subject 6213's eyes are normal but are often hidden behind the lenses of its glasses. Its most distinct feature is its frightened mouth, often seen during confrontational interactions with customers. 

Subject 6213 has shown to be a highly creative individual with a vivid imagination. It engages in numerous unusual hobbies such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. While these quirks may seem harmless, the Foundation believes it may potentially pose a risk to the Veil if left unchecked.

Addendum 6213-01: Incident Report 

On ██/██/20██, subject 6213 was observed leaving the fast food restaurant during a scheduled break. Upon returning from the break, it was observed to have an unusual orange hue to its fur, a sign of engagement in a transformative spell. Further investigation revealed that subject 6213 was attending a nearby magic convention and had purchased an aura-altering spell from a street vendor. Despite repeated warnings from nearby Foundation agents, subject 6213 refused to return to work and insisted on showcasing its new "look" to customers. Foundation agents were eventually forced to intervene and neutralize the threat by wiping the memories of all present. 

Lesson learned. Surveillance on subject 6213 must also include off-hours activity.
