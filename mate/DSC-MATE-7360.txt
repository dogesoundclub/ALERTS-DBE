SCP Foundation Report

Object ID: SCP-7360

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7360 is to be contained in a standard animal containment cell, furnished with toys and healthy foods. The cell must be checked once a day for any damages, and its diet strictly monitored. Any harm or abuse disturbing SCP-7360 must be reported immediately to the animal care unit.

SCP-7360 should not have any access to nearby human personnel, and any interactions with it are only to be allowed through camera surveillance. In the case of emergencies, only the assigned veterinarian is allowed to approach SCP-7360 in the presence of security guards.

Description: SCP-7360 is a male monkey veterinarian, of an unknown species. The monkey's physical appearance is mostly humanoid, with the exception of the eyes. These dark, round eyes are circular, bright blue lenses similar to ski goggles.

Moreover, SCP-7360 adorns a police cap on its head with a matching gold hoop earring on the right ear. SCP-7360 carries itself with a swagger and enjoys wearing a red scarf around its neck as an accessory. The monkey also indulges in smoking cigarettes, which seem to provide a calming effect.

SCP-7360 exhibits an impulsive and impetuous personality, often disregarding the consequences of its actions. The monkey has a proclivity for stunts despite the risks and frequently attempts to showcase their bravado to impress or entertain others. SCP-7360 is also known for indulging in escapist fantasies with a particular preference for adventure and thrill-seeking activities.

Addendum: SCP-7360 was previously owned by a circus and brought to the Foundation due to a complaint of animal mistreatment. SCP-7360 responded well to training and currently cohabits peacefully with other animals. Although the monkey has no magical abilities or paranormal attributes, its existence in itself is a significant anomaly that continues to be researched.
