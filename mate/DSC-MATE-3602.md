DSC-MATE-3602, also known as "The Tiger Lawyer," is a unique specimen that eludes traditional classification. Adorned with a police cap and a medical mask covering his mouth, 3602 is often mistaken for a vigilante, although his occupation as a lawyer suggests otherwise.

Sporting a set of red clown eyes, DSC-MATE-3602 stands out in any room he enters, and his gold chain only adds to his flamboyant demeanor. Beneath this flashy exterior, however, lies a creature of intuition, often able to predict events before they happen.

Despite his extraordinary abilities, 3602's personality is enigmatic and mysterious. He is known to be unsettling at times, often able to sense the emotions of those around him with ease. This proficiency is both impressive and unnerving, leading many to believe that he possesses genuine psychic powers.

Though his place amongst our ranks is uncertain, DSC-MATE-3602 is under close supervision and is to be approached with caution. Any attempts at reclassification are to be met with extreme caution, as any attempt to contain or coerce this entity may prove futile.
