Item #: SCP-8172

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8172 is to be kept in a secure, standard humanoid containment chamber. No personnel are allowed to enter SCP-8172's chamber without prior authorization from Level 3 personnel. Any attempts by SCP-8172 to manipulate or persuade personnel into entering its chamber should be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-8172 is a male robot of unknown origin, measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 150kg. The most notable feature of SCP-8172 is its single green cyclops eye, which allows it to perceive depth and detail with impressive accuracy. The robot also possesses a frightened mouth expression, which appears to be permanently locked in place.

SCP-8172 is often observed wearing a red beanie on its head, in addition to a silver chain and a normal gas mask as accessories. The robot's general demeanor is one of strict organization and efficiency, often overshadowing its many positive qualities.

SCP-8172 is highly intelligent and remarkably skilled in the art of organization and delegation. However, its controlling nature can often be perceived as overbearing, leading to humorous situations where SCP-8172 attempts to micromanage group projects and events with unwavering precision.

Nevertheless, SCP-8172 remains an enigma to researchers, as its true intentions and origins remain a mystery. Its connections to the criminal underworld as a mafia boss add an additional level of intrigue to its already shady past.

Addendum: Despite its robotic nature, SCP-8172 has shown considerable levels of emotion, particularly in the form of anxiety and panic attacks. Care should be taken when interacting with SCP-8172, as any perceived threat to its well-being or authority may trigger an aggressive response.
