Item #: 4778

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4778 is to be kept at its designated train station at all times and is only allowed to travel on its designated tracks. No human or living entity should attempt to tamper with SCP-4778 or board it during its operational hours. Any unauthorized personnel found near or aboard SCP-4778 will be immediately terminated.

Description: SCP-4778 appears to be a humanoid robot designed to operate as a train driver. It has a singular green cyclops eye set inside a skull-like face, a ski goggle for the other eye and a constantly frightened mouth. In addition, SCP-4778's head is covered by a bucket hat with a goggle placed on the forehead. SCP-4778 has a silver chain around its neck and carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-4778 displays traits similar to those of a friendly and social human, often attempting to engage in playful banter and telling jokes to the passengers. SCP-4778 values harmony and companionship, making it an excellent conversationalist, but can also become highly distressed when dealing with conflict.

SCP-4778's physical capabilities are above average for most robots of its type, with the ability to operate and control the speed of the train. However, SCP-4778's obedience to its operator's directives can become compromised if the operator requests it to perform unlawful actions or maneuvers.

Addendum: SCP-4778 was recovered from a train station after it was reported to have caused an incident once any unauthorized being entered its train carriage. SCP-4778 was inoperable for a short time and was then deemed anomalous. SCP-4778 has been given clearance from further evaluation and is now seen as contained under a controlled environment.
