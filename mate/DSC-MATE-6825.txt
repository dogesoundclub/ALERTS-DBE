Item #: 6825

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6825 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls, floor, and ceiling. The chamber must be equipped with a self-contained air filtration system and temperature control unit capable of maintaining a consistent temperature of 20Â°C. SCP-6825 is to be provided with a standard issue firefighter uniform and any necessary equipment for their work.

Description: SCP-6825 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. They stand at 120cm tall and weigh approximately 60kg. SCP-6825 wears horned rim glasses and a doge hat on their head. They also have a 2 color band on their forehead, jade earrings on their ears, and a silver chain around their neck. SCP-6825 is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-6825, despite its appearance, works as a firefighter for the local fire department. However, they have difficulty remembering appointments, dates, and important events due to their absent-mindedness. SCP-6825 has a friendly personality and easily makes friends with those around them.

SCP-6825's anomalous properties have been observed to cause fires to be extinguished by simply being in their presence. The cause of this is unknown, but it is believed to be linked to the rabbit's ability to shift the elemental balance of a fire. As a result, SCP-6825 has been kept on standby for use in emergencies, despite the potential risks associated with it.

Addendum: SCP-6825 has expressed a desire to learn more about their abilities and has requested access to Foundation resources to aid in their research. After careful consideration, this request has been approved, and SCP-6825 has been granted limited access to laboratory facilities and research materials. Any progress made will be closely monitored by Foundation personnel.
