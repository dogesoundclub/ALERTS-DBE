Item #: SCP-1983

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1983 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Caretakers are not to allow any recording devices inside SCP-1983's containment chamber, as this may cause severe psychological distress. SCP-1983 may be granted limited access to news channels under supervision for mental well-being. Physical interaction with SCP-1983 is only permitted for research purposes and requires Level 3 clearance.

Description: SCP-1983 is a male monkey of an unknown species, measuring 2.4 ft in height and weighing approximately 22 pounds. SCP-1983's most noticeable facial feature is its constantly frightened mouth. SCP-1983 wears a headset and a purple cap with a jade earring pierced in one ear. It also sports a pair of normal glasses, a red scarf, and carries a candy stick at all times. SCP-1983 is a news anchor for a leading news channel and is known to deliver the news in a professional and efficient manner.

SCP-1983 possesses an organized and efficient personality, often taking charge of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. SCP-1983's controlling nature can sometimes lead to humorous situations. Psychological evaluations indicate that SCP-1983 has high levels of anxiety and distress, which can be attributed to its unknown origins and captivity.

Addendum: It was discovered that SCP-1983 has mild telepathic abilities, allowing it to communicate with humans and other species of primates. However, the Foundation prohibits the use of SCP-1983's abilities for security reasons. Testing is still ongoing to determine the extent of SCP-1983's telepathic abilities.
