Item #: 8026

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 8026 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-19. The chamber must be equipped with surveillance cameras and audio equipment allowing constant monitoring of the item's behavior.

No personnel are to engage in any physical contact with Item 8026 unless it is necessary for containment or research purposes, in which case they must wear protective gear at all times.

In addition, a member of the Site-19 staff must bring Item 8026 fresh vegetables and fruits on a daily basis, as well as access to a gym to keep its physical health in check.

Description: Item 8026 is a male rabbit, standing at 1.2 meters tall. It wears a brown retro cap and a gold chain around its neck, as well as carrying a whistle as one of its accessories. Despite its frightened mouth and unknown colored eyes, it exhibits a relaxed posture and demeanor.

Item 8026 possesses a unique ability, allowing it to create clothing items from natural materials such as leaves, twigs, and flowers. Its creations possess exceptional quality and durability, making it highly sought after in the fashion industry.

However, Item 8026's impulsive nature and lack of foresight often lead it into humorous situations which may jeopardize the containment of the item. Its tendency to act on emotion may prove problematic in the future, and as such, it should be observed closely to prevent any mishaps.

Addendum: During an incident in Site-19's botanical garden, Item 8026 created a dress out of a species of plant never before identified. Analysis of the plant's properties yielded unprecedented results which may prove useful in future experiments. However, due to potential anomalies presented by the plant, its use is not recommended without thorough examination first.
