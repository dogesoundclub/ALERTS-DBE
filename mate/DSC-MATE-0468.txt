Item #: SCP-468

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-468 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-468 is strictly limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. SCP-468 is allowed to continue their employment as a lawyer outside of containment, but must be monitored at all times during work hours. SCP-468 is not to be allowed access to any bodies of open water.

Description: SCP-468 is a human female with distinct orange stripes on their face. Their eyes have been replaced with VR rainbow LED display lenses. SCP-468's head hair is not arranged and of green color. A goggle is positioned on their forehead that has no apparent use other than aesthetics. SCP-468 typically wears a choker accessorized around their neck.

SCP-468 has a highly spontaneous personality, often taking on risky behaviors or making impulsive decisions. They have been previously noted to jump off a cliff into a nearby lake or river without caution, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-468 also tends to have a cavalier attitude towards their own protection and willingly puts themselves in harm's way with little regard for personal safety.

SCP-468 was discovered during an investigation into a spate of underwater accidents involving legally dubious cases within water parks, raves, and other aquatic events. Investigation henceforth led an SCP agent to SCP-468. SCP-468 displayed an extraordinary level of distraction from their work which became too severe to manage. Hence, they were apprehended and contained by SCP.

Addendum: Due to their spontaneous attitude, SCP-468 has proven difficult to contain, often resorting to unpredictable and erratic behavior. Personnel are advised to keep a close eye on SCP-468 at all times during their work hours. Any instances of inappropriate or dangerous behavior should be reported immediately to the nearest commanding officer for necessary action.
