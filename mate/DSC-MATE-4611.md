Item #: 4611

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedure: Subject 4611 is to be contained within a standard apartment cell located within Site-██. Access to recreational activities and socialization is allowed with approval from at least two Level-3 personnel. In the event of a containment breach, subject 4611 is to be considered non-hostile and should be approached with caution.

Description: Subject 4611 is a human male of average height and weight, with distinctive orange stripes on their face. The subject wears large nerd glasses over their eyes and a short peak cap on their head, often adorned with a red victory band on their forehead. One green cross earring is visible in the subject's ear, and they are commonly seen wearing a red scarf as an accessory.

Subject 4611 currently holds a position as a theater manager in a local venue, and is well-regarded by their peers and employees. They possess a great sense of humor and are known to enjoy making others laugh, often regaling others with funny stories or engaging in silly impersonations to lighten the mood.

Despite their jovial outward personality, subject 4611 appears to have a deep-seated fear of failure and rejection, which has caused them to be somewhat guarded about their personal life. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this fear stems from any anomalous properties.

Addendum: Subject 4611's abilities appear to be entirely mundane, and no anomalous properties have been detected. However, their humor and charm have proven to be useful in the containment of other anomalous entities, and they have been utilized as a liaison between containment personnel and certain less hostile DSCs.
