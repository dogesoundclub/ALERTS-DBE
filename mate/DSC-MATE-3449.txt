Item #: SCP-3449

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3449 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-3449 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and higher, and all interactions must be monitored by a camera and an assigned guard. SCP-3449's job as a lawyer is to be maintained, and all documents related to his profession are to be screened before allowed into his containment cell.

Description: SCP-3449 is a male human of Caucasian descent, approximately 33 years of age. SCP-3449 is 1.75m tall and weighs 73 kg. SCP-3449 has a frightened mouth and wears normal glasses. SCP-3449's head is not arranged green in any way. SCP-3449 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more tasks than necessary. SCP-3449's strong work ethic is matched only by his love of dancing and having fun.

SCP-3449's personality is a curious mix of professional and playful. His strong sense of duty and focus on his job is key to his success as a lawyer, while his playful attitude often catches others off guard. SCP-3449 is known for his dance moves, which range from silly antics on the dance floor to more serious and skilled movements. It is believed that SCP-3449's tendency to let loose is an outlet for the stress and pressure of his job.

Personnel working with SCP-3449 are advised to approach with caution, as his playful attitude may mask deeper emotional issues resulting from his work. SCP-3449 has been known to become more withdrawn and anxious when under extreme stress or pressure, and it is recommended that activities are arranged to help alleviate these feelings.

SCP-3449's ability to balance his professional and playful personalities may make him useful in certain situations, and any proposals for his usage outside his containment cell must receive prior approval from the O5 Council.
