Item #: 9865

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9865 is to be kept in a reinforced cell at all times, with no direct contact allowed with any personnel. The cell is to be monitored via CCTV at all times, and any attempts at communication with 9865 are to be logged and reported immediately. The use of sound-proofing technology is strongly advised, as the subject's emotional outbursts can be both unpredictable and disruptive.

Description: Subject 9865 is a female human, approximately 25 years of age, 5'6" in height, and weighing around 135 lbs. The subject has distinctive spots across her face, alongside her purple lips. She wears a retro cap on her head, with a green cross earring attached to each earlobe. 9865 is noted to be wrapped in a gold chain, and often seen carrying a cigarette.

The subject's personality is of a deeply emotional nature, with a tendency to display empathy to even the slightest emotion-drenching moment portrayed in movies, TV shows, or music. Subject 9865 is prone to tears in such instances and can become exceedingly defensive or belligerent when questioned.

Under no circumstances should 9865 be allowed access to any emotional triggers or stimuli, as it is believed that such could lead to a heightened emotional response, making security a priority. As a villain, 9865 would resort to anything necessary in bringing distress to the general public; hence, any mistake in keeping subject under the strictest surveillance could prove fatal.

Addendum: After several years of close monitoring, it has been noted that Subject 9865 is capable of controlling her emotional outbursts extensively when provoked. This surprising discovery should be taken into account in any future containment procedures for the subject, but it does not detract from the security concerns with which 9865 is still regarded.
