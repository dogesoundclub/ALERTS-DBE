Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6304 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber fitted with a carrot dispenser and water bottle, regularly checked for malfunctions. The chamber is to be lined with soundproofing material to prevent audience debates during speeches. Subject 6304 is currently allowed to travel at their leisure.

Description: Subject 6304 appears as an average rabbit wearing a purple cap with a headset and normal glasses. A silver chain adorned around his neck, leading observers to believe it has sentimental value.

When speaking in a legislative setting, subject 6304 will wear a normal gas mask to protect himself from possible biological hazards. However, in non-threatening environments, it has been observed that the gas mask is worn to intimidate other members. This behavior is subject to monitoring moving forward.

In terms of personality, subject 6304 is analytical and precise. There is a steady and careful approach to how he approaches problems, which can sound convincing during speeches, leaving his audience in awe. Alas, this often translates well in verbal debates, leading to quick-witted responses, which can be contradictory or inflammatory.

In the past, the subject has been accused of misusing public funds and accepting bribes, which resulted in sanctions, but his exceptional oratory skills keep his reputation intact.

Addendum: The Foundation has been investigating possible links between the politician, and GoI activities due to his recent increased popularity among paranormal communities. Further investigation into the subject's activities is ongoing.
