SCP-8541, codenamed "Dr. Hopper", is a male rabbit of unknown origin currently working as a medical practitioner for the Foundation. Dr. Hopper sports a blue bandana over his head and is often seen wearing normal glasses. He also wears a silver chain as well as an LED gas mask, an accessory that is believed to aid in his ability to detect and diagnose illnesses.

Dr. Hopper possesses an unusually keen sense of observation and pays great attention to detail in his work. This trait makes him a valuable asset in the field of medicine, as he is able to discern patterns and symptoms that others may overlook. However, his compulsion for perfection can result in him obsessing over the smallest details, leading to delays in his work or causing him to become overly focused on finding the perfect solution for a given problem.

Despite his minor quirks, Dr. Hopper is known for his generosity and thoughtfulness, often taking great care in selecting gifts for his colleagues and patients. However, his gift-giving tendencies have led to some speculation about his motives and intentions, with some suggesting that he may be using his gifts as a means of gaining trust and gathering information.

Overall, SCP-8541 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation's medical staff, as well as an enigmatic and intriguing figure with a somewhat mysterious past.
