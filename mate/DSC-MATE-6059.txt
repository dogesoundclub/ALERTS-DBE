Description: SCP-6059 is a male human who previously worked as a banker. SCP-6059 exhibits a distinct fear response, often characterized by a trembling and wide-open mouth. SCP-6059's eyes manifest as red clown eyes, on occasion, exhibiting circus-style flashing lights. SCP-6059's head is outfitted with a headset with a built-in LED light. A two-color band commonly adorned on SCP-6059's forehead. SCP-6059 can be seen with a cigarette in his mouth. 

SCP-6059 is generally quite independent in nature, which leads to him often being unable or unwilling to ask for assistance when necessary. This trait can lead to humorous situations; however, it also presents a danger to SCP-6059's safety if immediate assistance is necessary. SCP-6059's stubbornness may also lead to difficulties in personnel interviews, as he may not willingly furnish pertinent information. 

Addendum: It is recommended that personnel interact with SCP-6059 in a friendly and non-threatening manner. Assistance and services should be offered repeatedly, as SCP-6059 may require encouragement to accept them. SCP-6059 should be monitored closely due to his pre-existing anxiety and potential for self-endangerment.
