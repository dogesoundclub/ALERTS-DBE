SCP-101 is a highly unusual character encountered by our agents in the urban landscape. Believed to be a human female, she is most recognizable by her red lips, which stand out conspicuously against her otherwise unassuming appearance. More striking, however, are her eyes, which have the disconcerting shape and coloration of a clown's. Her face is partially covered by a medical mask, suggesting she may suffer from respiratory issues.

SCP-101's head is always covered by a hoodie, giving the impression that she prefers to keep her identity concealed. She is often seen wearing a gold chain, which appears to be purely decorative in nature. This hint of opulence contrasts sharply with her advocacy for social justice and her desire to make the world a better place.

SCP-101's personality seems to be defined by her idealism, which borders on fanaticism at times. She is unapologetically committed to her causes and can become passionate to the point of protesting or even boycotting companies or causes that she feels go against her values. Despite this, she remains a mystery to our agents and her motives are difficult to ascertain. Further research is required to fully unravel the enigma that is SCP-101.
