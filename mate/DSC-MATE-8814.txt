SCP-8814's head is consistent with that of a witch's short haircut, and they are observed wearing a single green cross earring and a gold chain. The entity also wears an LED-filled gas mask, which is always aglow.

SCP-8814 exhibits a highly observant and attentive personality, with a propensity for gift-giving. They are highly concerned with finding the perfect gift to give and can spend a significant amount of time attempting to do so. SCP-8814's highly adaptable nature makes them adept at mimicking and observing human behavior as well.

Addendum: Incident Log 8814-1 -
On 08/08/20██, SCP-8814 managed to escape its containment cell, using its highly mimicking and adaptive behavior to deceive the guards. Foundation staff were able to track and recontain SCP-8814 with ease, but the incident highlights the need for strict electronic communication monitoring and vigilance around SCP-8814 at all times.
