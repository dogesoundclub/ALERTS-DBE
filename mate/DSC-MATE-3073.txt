Item #: 3073

Object Class: Sapient

Special Containment Procedures: 

Subject 3073 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit with access to a variety of fruit and nuts for consumption. Subject 3073 is to be provided a daily newspaper and internet access to ensure their reporting duties are fulfilled. Subject 3073 is not to be allowed access to any press events or interviews that may compromise the veil of the supernatural.

Description: 

Subject 3073 appears as a sapient monkey of the chimpanzee genus, wearing a bucket hat and normal glasses. Subject 3073 is often seen with a lit cigarette in hand and has been observed to puff smoke rings, but it is unknown if the habit has any adverse effects on their health. 

Subject 3073 identifies as male and has a preference for traditional customs and storytelling, which they may use in their work as a reporter. Despite their no-nonsense attitude, Subject 3073 can be playful and enjoys engaging others with humor and anecdotes passed down from their community.

Subject 3073 has not exhibited any anomalous abilities or properties, but they have been known to exhibit above-average intelligence for their species, with a particular talent for language and communication.

Addendum: 

Subject 3073's report on the recent werewolf sightings in the city were deemed a prime example of quality journalism despite their hominid creature bias. The Foundation notes that continued positive exposure to media personnel holding SCP status could benefit efforts of collaboration between the Foundation and non-anomalous authorities.
