Item #: 3012

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the dangerous nature of 3012, she must be contained in a specially designed cell located in a high-security facility. The cell must have reinforced walls and a remotely operated containment door to ensure the safety of the personnel. No one is allowed to approach 3012 without proper authorization and an armed escort. Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear a level 5 biohazard suit and undergo decontamination procedures upon exiting.

Description: 3012 is a female humanoid of the human species, who appears to be in her mid-30s. However, she possesses unique features that set her apart from normal humans. Her face is covered in orange stripes, and she has red lips that are always visible beneath a white medical mask. She also has orange eyebrows, and her forehead features two colored bands. The most notable feature is the green cross earring that she wears on each ear.

3012’s personality is complex due to her occupation as a mafia boss. She is ruthless, cunning, and always thinking two steps ahead of her enemies. She has the ability to manipulate people’s minds and turn them against each other, making her an extremely dangerous adversary. However, she can be absent-minded and forgetful, leading to humorous situations. She frequently loses track of time and misses important events or appointments.

Her choker is believed to provide some form of protection against psychic attacks, although this has not been confirmed.

Addendum: 3012 is known to be heavily involved in the black market trade of anomalous items, and has been connected to several major SCP-related incidents. It is believed that she has a network of loyal followers who aid her in her criminal endeavors. Any information regarding her whereabouts must be immediately reported to the Foundation for further investigation.
