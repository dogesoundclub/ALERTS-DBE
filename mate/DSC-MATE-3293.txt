Item #: 3293

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3293 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a reinforced door and a secure ventilation system. The LED Gas Mask accessory must be securely fastened to SCP-3293's face at all times, and must be replaced immediately should it become damaged or non-functional.

SCP-3293 is to be provided with a daily dose of carrots and lettuce, as well as any additional dietary supplements deemed necessary by medical personnel. SCP-3293 is allowed one hour of exercise in a designated containment area per day, monitored by at least one Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-3293 is a male rabbit measuring approximately 50 cm in length and weighing 2 kg. It possesses a police cap on its head and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-3293's mouth is notably in a constant state of fright, which may be related to its previous occupation as a firefighter.

SCP-3293 displays a personality characterized by extreme organization and efficiency. It has been observed to take control of group projects and assign tasks to others in a direct and matter-of-fact manner. This behavior can come across as controlling, although SCP-3293 appears to have no malicious intent.

SCP-3293 has exhibited limited instances of anomalous activity, including the ability to manipulate small flames and smoke particles in its presence. It is currently unknown whether this ability is related to its previous occupation.

Addendum: SCP-3293 was recovered from the outskirts of [REDACTED], where it had taken up residence in a local fire station. Initial encounters with local firefighters were tense, as SCP-3293 had apparently taken control of firefighting operations and refused to leave the premises.

Following peaceful negotiations and successful containment, SCP-3293 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel. Its anomalous capabilities are currently under investigation by research teams.
