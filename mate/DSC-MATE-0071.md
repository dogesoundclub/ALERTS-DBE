Description: DSC-MATE-71 is a male Tiger, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing roughly 135 kg. DSC-MATE-71 has a distinctive appearance, wearing a red beanie on their head and a red cross earring on their right ear. In addition, DSC-MATE-71 wears a gold chain around their neck and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-71 possesses a strong sense of independence, often refusing assistance even when it is clearly necessary. They are often seen attempting to perform tasks alone that would be easier with help, such as moving heavy furniture or refusing to use a map when lost. DSC-MATE-71's stubbornness has been observed to lead to humorous situations, though it poses a potential danger to Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-71 is a lawyer by profession, possessing an extensive knowledge of legal procedures and protocols in various countries. DSC-MATE-71 has been observed to be exceptionally skilled at arguing their case and has been known to win even the most difficult legal battles. However, their anger can quickly escalate during legal disputes, leading to physical confrontations.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-71 was recovered by Foundation agents after they were involved in an altercation with local law enforcement during a legal dispute. Foundation agents were able to subdue DSC-MATE-71 and bring them into Foundation custody. DSC-MATE-71 has since been cooperative with Foundation personnel, though their stubbornness remains a potential issue.
