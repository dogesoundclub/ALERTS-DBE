Item #: SCP-8166

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8166 is to be contained in a rural area with a large farm where they can continue their work. Personnel assigned to SCP-8166 must be well-versed in agriculture and familiar with dealing with individuals with unusual appearances. Guards are to be posted around the perimeter of the farm and must be instructed to wear protective gear at all times when interacting with SCP-8166.

Description: SCP-8166 is a humanoid designated as a farmer. SCP-8166 is a female with striking orange stripes on their face, accompanied by a set of orange eyebrows and a red lip. SCP-8166 has blonde hair, with what appears to be a wing protruding from their head. SCP-8166 wears a jade earring and a gold chain around their neck. A medical mask covers SCP-8166's mouth.

SCP-8166's personality is laid-back and easy-going, but they can also be fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. This trait can lead to humorous situations, such as getting into arguments with someone who insults a friend or family member. Despite their unusual appearance, SCP-8166 displays no hostile tendencies and possesses the ability to communicate fluently in several languages.

SCP-8166's farm contains various plants and animals not found in conventional farming. SCP-8166 seems to have an uncanny ability to grow plants and crops that are supposedly incompatible with the soil and climate of the area. SCP-8166 has repeatedly refused to disclose any information regarding their methods, citing them as trade secrets.

SCP-8166 has shown little interest in the outside world, preferring to focus on their work. SCP-8166 has frequently expressed their desire to keep their farm and its contents out of public view. SCP-8166 is cooperative and non-resistant towards Foundation personnel, and regular deliveries of supplies ensure their continued cooperation.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8166's usefulness in agricultural research, Mobile Task Force Theta-5 (The Green Thumbs) has been granted clearance to perform experiments and studies on SCP-8166's farm and its contents. All experiments must be approved by the Site Director and SCP-8166's approval must be received beforehand. SCP-8166 is to be granted Class B amnestics after experiments are completed.
