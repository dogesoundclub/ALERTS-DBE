Item #: DSC-MATE-7607

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7607 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced steel walls to prevent any possibility of escape. DSC-MATE-7607 is to be sedated every day to ensure its compliance with orders and to prevent any sudden outbursts. DSC-MATE-7607's cell is to be furnished with a bed, a desk, and a computer with restricted access to the internet, to enable DSC-MATE-7607 to help maintain a low profile in the outside world. DSC-MATE-7607 is to be fed only raw meat and a diet consisting of vitamins and minerals to support its tiger physiology.

Description: DSC-MATE-7607 is a male tiger-human hybrid, standing at approximately 6 feet tall on hind legs. DSC-MATE-7607 wears a Doge Hat and Nerd Glasses, giving it the appearance of a well-read intellectual. DSC-MATE-7607's face feature is a Frightened Mouth, accentuating its nervous and anxious nature.

DSC-MATE-7607 is a gifted programmer and has a keen eye for detail and precision in coding. However, DSC-MATE-7607's gift-giving nature can become a double-edged sword, with the entity often overthinking the 'perfect' present and thus causing undue stress.

DSC-MATE-7607 is skittish and easily startled, often accompanied by sudden, unpredictable movements. Despite its nervousness, DSC-MATE-7607 can be fiercely territorial and will become aggressive if it perceives a potential threat.

Note from Dr. ██████: "Care should be taken when interacting with DSC-MATE-7607, however, the entity is intelligent and cognitively aware. A collaborative approach can help alleviate DSC-MATE-7607's stress levels and provide a productive member to our organization."

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7607 is often depicted wearing a gold chain; however, staff should not encourage DSC-MATE-7607 to display it, as it may become aggressive over perceived threats to its jewelry.
