Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6548 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-6548 is to be granted only with level 2 clearance and under strict supervision. SCP-6548 is not to be allowed any contact with tobacco products of any kind.

Description: SCP-6548 appears to be a human female with a variety of unique physical features. The most noticeable feature is a large amount of spots covering the face and upper body. SCP-6548 also has a purple tint to the lips, which suggests a possible genetic abnormality. The eyes of SCP-6548 are cybernetically enhanced with VR Jade LED technology. SCP-6548 is commonly seen wearing a retro-style cap, along with a gold chain and cigarette.

SCP-6548 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, as evidenced by their chosen profession as a doctor. However, SCP-6548 also possesses a carefree attitude and enjoys having fun. This has led to humorous situations, such as surprise dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor at social events.

SCP-6548 displays no anomalous properties beyond their physical appearance and personality traits. However, it is recommended that all interactions with SCP-6548 be conducted with caution, as their unpredictability and unusual traits may cause discomfort or confusion to those around them.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-6548 was found attempting to smuggle tobacco products into the containment area. SCP-6548 was reprimanded and reminded of the strict no-tobacco policy in effect for all SCP containment areas.
