Object designation: SCP-3256

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3256 is to be kept in a standard humanoid cell at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-3256 must be limited to approved personnel only. Any attempts by SCP-3256 to manipulate individuals or instigate a negative emotional response should be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-3256 is a human male, identified as a car salesman by occupation. SCP-3256 exhibits several unique physical characteristics, including orange stripes across the face, ski goggle eyes, a green cross earring, a mohawk, a medical mask, and a gold chain necklace.

SCP-3256's personality is characterized by an overwhelming sense of empathy and compassion, which often leads to them taking on the problems of others. This empathetic trait can manifest in different ways, either by comforting individuals, or attempting to take actions to resolve the issue. SCP-3256 appears to feel responsible for the well-being of others around them, which often results in personal exhaustion due to overexertion.

SCP-3256 appears to exhibit a unique ability to manipulate individuals around them by instilling positive emotions in those they come into contact with. This ability has been shown to enhance SCP-3256's ability to excel at sales and customer service, but has also been noted to potentially affect the emotional state of the individuals affected by SCP-3256. 

Addendum: SCP-3256 was discovered following a series of reports of abnormal car sales figures in several local dealerships. Reports indicated that SCP-3256 was employed at each of the affected dealerships during the period in question. A Foundation investigation revealed that SCP-3256 had been using their abilities to influence the purchase decisions of potential car buyers. SCP-3256 was subsequently taken into Foundation custody, and has exhibited no hostile or dangerous behavior since containment.
