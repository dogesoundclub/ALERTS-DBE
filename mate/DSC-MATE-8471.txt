Item #: SCP-8471

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8471 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The gas mask is to be kept in a separate storage locker and only accessed with Level 2 clearance. It is recommended that all personnel exercise caution when engaging with SCP-8471 due to their snarky and often sarcastic demeanor.

Description: SCP-8471 appears to be a female human farmer, standing at approximately 168 cm in height. They have spotted facial features and bright red lips. SCP-8471's most distinctive feature is their eyes, which appear to be VR Jade LED. SCP-8471's head is always covered by a black hoodie, and they wear a gold chain around their neck.

The most unusual aspect of SCP-8471's appearance is the gas mask they wear. While this may be interpreted as a protective measure due to the nature of their work, SCP-8471 has been observed wearing the gas mask in environments that require no breathing apparatus.

SCP-8471 possesses a highly analytical and logical mind, and often displays a dry sense of humor. Despite this, they have been known to take risks and can be highly impulsive at times. SCP-8471's tendency to tease their friends and colleagues in a deadpan manner has resulted in strained relationships on occasion.

Addendum: SCP-8471 has exhibited a strong talent for horticulture and has expressed a desire to cultivate anomalous plant specimens. While their proposal is currently under review by Site-██'s botanical department, it has been noted that SCP-8471's expertise in farming practices could prove highly beneficial to the Foundation.
