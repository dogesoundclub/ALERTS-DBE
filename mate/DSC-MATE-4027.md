Item #: 4027

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4027-A is to be kept in an enclosure with dimensions of no less than 5m x 5m x 5m. No personnel are allowed to enter the enclosure unless accompanied by at least two armed guards. 4027-A is to be fed a strict diet to maintain physical health and will have access to tools and materials to attend to  mechanical projects. 

Description: 4027-A is a male monkey with a height of 50cm and a weight of 9kg with grey and white fur. It is commonly found wearing a blue bandana on its head along with a pair of nerd glasses and a gold earring. 4027-A is known to wear a red scarf and an LED gas mask at all times. The mask, when turned on, emits a bright light that obscures 4027-Aâ€™s face.

Personality-wise, 4027-A is detail-oriented and sometimes obsessive, often alphabetizing their tools and materials frequently. When given the opportunity, it will spend hours working on anything mechanical or electrical with an almost fanatical attention to detail. 4027-A also has a strong preference for order, as evidenced by its meticulous color-coding of all its equipment and tools. 

4027-A has shown no signs of aggression except during episodes of separation anxiety when it is kept away from mechanical equipment for extended periods. In those cases, it thrashes against the enclosure walls and will often throw tools or items within reach in frustration.

Addendum: 4027-A is believed to have been trained by a mechanic before being lost or abandoned, leading to its fascination with mechanical engineering. It is unknown what led to its current anomalous state.
