Item #: DSC-MATE-220

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-220 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber with minimal decorations. The walls and furnishings should be kept in neutral colors to reduce the risk of triggering DSC-MATE-220's anomalous effects. Personal items such as clothing and accessories must be approved by at least two Level 2 personnel before being allowed into the chamber.

Description: DSC-MATE-220 is a human male identified as a fashion designer by profession. He stands at approximately 175 cm in height and weighs 70 kg. His most notable physical feature is his permanently wide smile, which extends from ear to ear. DSC-MATE-220's eyes are blue in color and resemble those of a clown. He has green hair that he often wears in a purple cap, and a jade earring adorns his left ear. His choice of accessories includes a silver chain and a candy stick, which he often chews on.

DSC-MATE-220 exhibits an unpredictable and spontaneous personality. He is prone to taking risks and making impulsive decisions, often without considering the consequences. These tendencies have led to several incidents where DSC-MATE-220 put himself in danger. In one instance, DSC-MATE-220 jumped off a cliff into a river, narrowly avoiding injury.

DSC-MATE-220's anomalous effects manifest when personal items he creates are worn by non-anomalous individuals. Wearing any item created by DSC-MATE-220 causes the individual to adopt the same impulsive and unpredictable personality traits as DSC-MATE-220. These personalities are often exaggerated, resulting in excessive risk-taking behavior.

DSC-MATE-220's creations include clothing, accessories, and even perfumes. The anomalous effects of his creations can last for up to 24 hours after removal. Research is ongoing to determine the mechanism behind DSC-MATE-220's anomalous abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-220 must be monitored closely to prevent unauthorized access to his creations. Any incidents involving DSC-MATE-220's creations should be reported to the Site Director immediately.
