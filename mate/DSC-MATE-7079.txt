Description: SCP-7079 is a male monkey with ski goggle eyes and jade earring ears. It stands at 1.2 meters in height and is commonly found wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette. SCP-7079 has demonstrated a high level of intelligence and a remarkable ability to communicate through sign language.

SCP-7079 had previously worked as a car salesman before being contained by the Foundation. It is not known how SCP-7079 gained the ability to speak or its level of sapience.

SCP-7079 has a tendency to act on its emotions without thinking through the consequences, leading to humorous situations. However, it is unknown if SCP-7079's actions are due to its personality or a side effect of its anomalous nature.

Interview logs with SCP-7079 have revealed that it refers to itself as "Frankie" and has expressed a desire to be released from containment to return to its previous life. However, due to its potential danger to the public, a release is not considered a viable option.

Addendum: Daily psychological evaluations of SCP-7079 indicate that it is experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Requests for additional environmental enrichment and cognitive stimulation have been approved by the Site Director.
