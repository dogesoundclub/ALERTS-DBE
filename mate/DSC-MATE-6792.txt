Item #: SCP-6792
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-6792 is to be kept within a secure, soundproofed chamber at all times. Access to SCP-6792 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and all persons entering the chamber must wear noise-cancelling ear protection. SCP-6792’s LED Gas Mask must be worn at all times when outside of its containment chamber.

Description:
SCP-6792 is a female human of unknown origins, witnessed with dark spots on her face, and presents an almost constant, disarming smile. Its head is not arranged but seems to have a matching hairstyle with the green dress to be worn on formal events. SCP-6792 is typically benign, however, psychological testing has revealed a strong sense of independence and rebellious tendencies.

When agitated, SCP-6792 will lash out in the form of loud, deafening screams. These screams are capable of rupturing eardrums and causing severe auditory hallucinations. SCP-6792 is also known to have an affinity for large gatherings, like theater events, and will seek to perform managerial duties when left alone for extended periods of time.

SCP-6792’s choker is not believed to have any anomalous properties at this time, but further testing is required to confirm this hypothesis.

Addendum:
SCP-6792 is to be used for entertainment purposes only, and personnel are not allowed to treat SCP-6792 as anything else. Any attempts to establish an emotional connection with SCP-6792 will be met with disciplinary action. SCP-6792 is not to be taken outside of its containment chamber unless approved by Level 3 personnel.
