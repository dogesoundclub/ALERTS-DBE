Item #: SCP-6235

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6235 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As a sapient and sentient entity, SCP-6235 is allowed to maintain employment as a mechanic at Site-██, so long as a Foundation-approved counselor regularly monitors its mental state. Any attempts by SCP-6235 to manipulate personnel for personal gain must be reported immediately. No gifts should be exchanged with SCP-6235 under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-6235 is a male rabbit, approximately 1.6 meters in height, exhibiting typical features of its species. SCP-6235 is capable of verbal communication in English and displays typical rabbit behavior such as a fondness for carrots and clovers, and an aversion to loud sounds or sudden movements.

SCP-6235 has a frightened mouth and wears normal glasses, hiding its eyes from scrutiny. Its head is always covered with a hoodie, hiding most of its face, with a two-color band above its forehead. SCP-6235 often wears a gold chain around its neck, as well as carrying a candy stick as a comfort item.

SCP-6235 is highly observant and attentive to details, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-6235 can become overly concerned with finding the “perfect” gift and can spend excessive amounts of time agonizing over what to get a recipient, leading to anxiety and stress.

Addendum: SCP-6235's condition developed due to a traumatic event in its early years. SCP-6235's gift-giving characteristics were developed as a coping mechanism, possibly related to childhood experiences involving gift-giving. SCP-6235's past experiences are still being researched, and any information discovered may be used to expedite its recovery from the psychological condition. Research into alternative coping mechanisms is ongoing.
