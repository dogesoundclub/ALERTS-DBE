Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Senator [REDACTED] must be contained in a secure, controlled environment at all times. Any contact with non-authorized personnel is strictly prohibited.

Description:

Subject 2261 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. Notably, the subject wears a distinctive headpiece, which has been identified as metal and purple in color. Additionally, the subject wears a jade earring, a silver chain, and a normal gas mask, all of which have been observed to be ordinary in nature.

The subject's most striking feature is their perpetual smile, which suggests a broader range of dental reconstruction. It has been reported that Subject 2261 exudes a kind of psychic energy, allowing them to predict future events and sense the emotions of others. Note that this has not been substantiated, and full testing is currently underway.

Subject 2261 works as a prominent public official and is well-known in their community. It has been noted that their presence can cause both confusion and unease in the people around them.

Attempts to track down the original creator of Subject 2261's metallic headpiece have been unsuccessful, and no known abilities have been observed as a result of the headpiece thus far. 

Additional notes:

Subject 2261 appears to be a regular human being who has undergone several modifications. However, their mystical abilities seem to be connected to the unusual metallic headpiece they wear. Further investigation is required to substantiate the claim. For now, it's crucial to contain the subject to ensure that their access to sensitive information and the wider public is limited.
