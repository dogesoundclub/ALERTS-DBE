Description: SCP-6126 is a female human of average height and weight. Her distinguishing features include red lips and short, witch-like hair. SCP-6126's profession prior to Foundation containment was that of a mechanic.

SCP-6126 possesses an unusually analytical and logical mind, which leads to her often engaging in debates, even over trivial or unimportant topics. Such interactions tend to be lighthearted and sometimes humorous, which has proven to be a useful tool in maintaining SCP-6126's mental stability.

SCP-6126 has shown a particular interest in mechanical and motorized machinery, stating that she enjoys the feeling of "watching the cogs turn." This knowledge has proven useful for the Foundation in repairing various equipment.

SCP-6126 has not exhibited any anomalous abilities or tendencies, making her classification as Safe appropriate. However, caution is advised in interactions with SCP-6126 due to her occasionally argumentative nature.
