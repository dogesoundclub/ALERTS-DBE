SCP-2204, nicknamed "The Clown Vet", is a human female with striking orange stripes adorning her face, contrasting with her black medical mask. Her eyes are unnerving, as they appear to be red clown eyes that follow observers around the room. SCP-2204 is known for wearing a green cross earring and a bucket hat that obscures the top of her face. The only accessory she wears is a gold chain around her neck, which is said to contain a tooth from each of her patients.

SCP-2204 is a veterinarian, specializing in the care of supernatural creatures. She tends to spend a lot of time daydreaming, which can lead to comical situations where she walks into poles or trips over obstacles. Despite her seemingly absent-minded demeanor, SCP-2204 is highly skilled in her field and is sought out by various creatures, such as werewolves, vampires, and fairies.

SCP-2204's introspective nature often leads her down dark paths, and she struggles with her emotions. She can become emotionally attached to her patients and is known to go to great lengths to keep them healthy. However, when things do not go as planned, SCP-2204 has been known to become angry and lash out at those around her.

SCP-2204 is to be monitored at all times, as her psychological state may influence her work with supernatural creatures. She is not to be approached when lost in thought, as she may become unpredictable.
