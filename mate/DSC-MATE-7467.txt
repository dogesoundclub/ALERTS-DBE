Item #: SCP-7467

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7467 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Personnel interacting with SCP-7467 must wear earplugs to prevent damage to their hearing. Any promotional material associated with SCP-7467 must be screened to ensure that it does not contain any harmful memetic effects.

Description: SCP-7467 appears to be a male Monkey salesman. It is approximately 1.8 meters in height, and weighs approximately 70 kilograms. SCP-7467 is notable for the 2-color band on its forehead and the goggles resting on top of it. It also has a frightened mouth shape, normal glasses, and a gold earring. SCP-7467 wears a silver chain and carries a whistle.

SCP-7467 is incredibly logical and enjoys debating with others. While it is often humorous, its debates can also become very heated and cause damage to the surrounding area. It has demonstrated an ability to rapidly learn and adapt to new situations.

SCP-7467's anomalous property is the ability to release a high-frequency whistle sound that can cause severe pain and ear damage to those within a 5-meter radius. Its whistle also emits a low-level psychic field that can influence individuals to agree with its point of view. SCP-7467 is aware of this ability and has used it to gain an advantage in debates.

Addendum: SCP-7467 was apprehended by Foundation agents when it caused a city-wide argument about the true color of a dress. Further testing is required to determine the extent of its memetic effects.
