Item #: SCP-2993

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2993 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Access to SCP-2993's room is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-2993's personal effects, including all hair and makeup supplies, are to be checked for any anomalous properties before entering or leaving its containment cell.

Description: SCP-2993 is a human male of average height and build who identifies as a beautician. SCP-2993 displays no anomalous physical abilities, but has shown a tendency towards rebellious behavior. It is often observed breaking rules or finding ways to bend them, purely for entertainment purposes. 

SCP-2993's appearance is distinctive: the entity is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, gold earrings, and a silver chain. SCP-2993 is also frequently seen smoking cigarettes while engaging in conversation with nearby personnel, though it will cease upon request.

SCP-2993 displays a charming personality and a ready smile, often utilizing humor to diffuse tense situations. However, it can be difficult to predict SCP-2993's reactions or behavior due to its unpredictable nature and sardonic wit.

SCP-2993 has been known to use its position as a beautician to gain access to restricted areas or secure personal information from personnel. While SCP-2993 has shown no aggression towards personnel or facilities, its disregard for authority and guidelines poses a potential threat to containment protocols.

Addendum: Testing of SCP-2993's personal effects has shown no anomalous properties. However, due to SCP-2993's mischievous nature, all items are to be monitored closely for any signs of unexpected behavior.
