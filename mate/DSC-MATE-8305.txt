Item #: SCP-8305

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8305 is to be kept in a secure storage unit at all times when it is not performing maintenance or electrical repairs. Any unauthorized access to SCP-8305 is strictly prohibited without the express written consent of at least one Level 3 personnel. Interaction with SCP-8305 must be conducted only through its communication system, and no physical contact is allowed.

Description: SCP-8305 is a robot designed to function as an electrician with highly advanced mechanical capabilities. Its body is primarily made of metal with various attachments for electrical work. SCP-8305 bears a humanoid shape and stands approximately 6 feet tall. The robot's green cyclops eye serves as its main visual sensor, while the nerd glasses are more of a cosmetic addition. Its head is adorned with a doge hat, and it wears a jade earring on one ear. SCP-8305 is usually seen with its accessory whistle attached to its belt.

SCP-8305 displays a highly empathetic and compassionate personality, with a strong desire to help others in need. However, this can often lead the robot to take on other people's problems as its responsibility, causing it to undertake potentially dangerous or overwhelming tasks that are not within its capacity. SCP-8305's personality has been described as both admirable and exhausting at the same time.

SCP-8305 is a valuable asset to the Foundation's electrical department, and its expertise has been instrumental in maintaining the organization's advanced technological systems. However, due to its unique personality and advanced abilities, SCP-8305 continues to receive regular monitoring and evaluation. Any changes to its behavior or reactions may indicate a change in the robot's neural network and warrant further investigation.

Note: SCP-8305 has demonstrated impressive resilience and selflessness during a recent containment breach, risking its own safety to save the lives of several Foundation personnel. The Foundation is henceforth to prioritize the maintenance of SCP-8305 to ensure its longevity and optimal performance.
