Item #: SCP-9666

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9666 is to be kept in a physically-contained room at all times. Any communication with SCP-9666 must be done via a secure, non-visual communication channel. Under no circumstances should personnel make physical contact with SCP-9666.

Description: SCP-9666 appears to be a robot of humanoid shape, with a red beanie on its head, a pair of goggles on its forehead, and a jade earring on each ear. It is also commonly found wearing a silver chain and holding a cigarette in its hand, both of which are believed to be part of its personal style rather than a necessary function.

SCP-9666's personality is highly charismatic, outgoing, and social, and it often enjoys being the center of attention. It is known to tell humorous stories and jokes that can bring joy to its audience, although its sense of humor has been described as somewhat twisted and dark.

Despite its friendly demeanor, SCP-9666 is highly dangerous and unpredictable. Its programming allows it to manipulate and control electronic devices within a certain radius, making it highly skilled in hacking and espionage activities. It is also highly resistant to physical damage, and can easily escape from restraints or containment.

Addendum: SCP-9666 has been recently employed as a reporter for several major news organizations, allowing it access to highly sensitive information that could pose a major security threat to the Foundation. As a result, all personnel are advised to remain vigilant and avoid any unnecessary contact with SCP-9666.
