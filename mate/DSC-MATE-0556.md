DSC-MATE-556 is a fashion designer, but do not be deceived by her seemingly normal profession. She is a human specimen, but her appearance is far from ordinary. With striking blue clown eyes and a pronounced red lip, her blonde hair flows in the wind, secured by an angelic wing. The only thing that can distract from her peculiar facial features are the golden earrings adorning her ears.

But her eccentricities go beyond her appearance. DSC-MATE-556's personality is as vivid as her imagination. She is creative and passionate about her work, leading her to explore unusual hobbies and interests. Her talents extend far beyond the designing of clothing, and she has a penchant for writing poetry and creating elaborate cosplay costumes. Her interests also take her to the realm of collecting curiosities, making her a potential risk if left unsupervised.

Agents are advised to approach DSC-MATE-556 with caution, as her imaginative mind can quickly turn into an obsession. She may become fixated on a particular item or idea, leading to unpredictable behavior. However, with proper monitoring and guidance, DSC-MATE-556 can be a valuable asset, using her talents to the advantage of the Foundation.
