Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2168 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, which should be furnished with a small bed, a table, and a chair.

Description: DSC-MATE-2168 is a monkey of male sex and blue bandana on its head, with ski goggle-shaped eyes, jade earrings on the ears, a gold chain, and a cigarette in his hand. DSC-MATE-2168 has exhibited an intelligence quotient higher than that of other monkeys, allowing him to converse with humans on a basic level.

DSC-MATE-2168 has taken on the guise of a fast-food worker at a popular chain restaurant, which it indefinitely continues to perform suitably. However, DSC-MATE-2168 will occasionally communicate unusual symptoms, such as obsessiveness to details. The exact extent to which this affects DSC-MATE-2168 is still under scrutiny. 

Addendum 2168.1: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-2168 was discovered alphabetizing the restaurant's spice rack while on duty, causing management to report it to the authorities. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots”) arrived at the scene and transported DSC-MATE-2168 to Site-██, where it was interrogated.

DSC-MATE-2168 revealed it had develop a habit of organizing its environment in a systematic order, thereby allowing it to work better. Workers at the restaurant had observed its organizational tendencies but assumed it was the usual quirk of its species. 

Addendum 2168.2: Documented Test

DSC-MATE-2168 was granted access to a blank notebook and instructed to alphabetize rows of letters. Over the course of seventy hours, DSC-MATE-2168 succeeded in alphabetizing 8,439 rows, each with forty-eight letters. Later examination of DSC-MATE-2168’s methodology revealed an idiosyncratic pattern whereby it would sequentially inspect two letters at each time, evaluating which letter comes first based on how it appears to DSC-MATE-2168 in a unique way.

Conclusion: Although DSC-MATE-2168’s organizational tendencies could be noted as behavior typical of a primate, it remains unclear whether it has far more intricate thought-patterns than other animals or humans, which can be explained only through a more detailed study of its cognitive ability. 

Note: It has been recently recommended that Item DSC-MATE-2168 must not have access to anything that could possibly induce obsessive-compulsive disorder, as this might compromise the strict work regimen, spread the disorder to individuals, and lead to a containment event.
