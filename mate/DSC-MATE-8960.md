Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8960 is to be contained in a standard secure humanoid containment chamber with appropriate food, clothing, and monitoring. DSC-MATE-8960's cell is to be outfitted with industrial-grade ventilation and plumbing systems to accommodate DSC-MATE-8960's scent and bodily disposal needs. Any items brought into DSC-MATE-8960's containment chamber are subject to thorough decontamination procedures. Due to DSC-MATE-8960's ability to generate outlandish and dangerous ideas, interactions with DSC-MATE-8960 should be limited.

DSC-MATE-8960 wears a police cap on its head and a red scarf around its neck, along with a pair of goggles on its forehead and a jade earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-8960 is often seen with a cigarette in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-8960 has a highly creative and imaginative personality, often brainstorming new and unexpected solutions to problems, even if such ideas can be outlandish or dangerous. DSC-MATE-8960 has been observed to enjoy testing the reactions of others with its ideas, no matter how absurd they may seem. Despite its jovial nature, DSC-MATE-8960 has the potential to cause highly disruptive and dangerous situations.
