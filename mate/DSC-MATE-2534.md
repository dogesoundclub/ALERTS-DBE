Item #: 2534

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2534 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel. They are permitted to continue their role as a real estate agent, but are forbidden from participating in any protests, boycotts, or other activities that may jeopardize their safety or compromise Foundation secrecy. 

Description: Subject 2534 is a human male of average height and weight. The subject's most notable features are the spots on their face and their wide, unsettling smile. However, it is their red clown eyes that are the most concerning of their physical attributes. 

In addition to their unusual facial features, Subject 2534 wears a bucket hat and a green cross earring on their left ear. They are often seen wearing a gold chain and a normal gas mask around their neck. 

Subject 2534 has a tendency towards idealism and a strong desire to make the world a better place. This has led to them engaging in various protests and boycotts against companies or organizations that they feel go against their values. While this can create humorous situations, it has also made them a potential liability for the Foundation. 

Addendum: Due to Subject 2534's potential for unpredictable behavior, all Foundation personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with them. Any changes in their behavior or activities should be immediately reported to on-site supervisors.
