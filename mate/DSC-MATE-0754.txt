Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-754 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. No human interaction with SCP-754 is authorized without permission of at least two Level 2 researchers. Any unauthorized attempt to communicate or interact with SCP-754 will result in immediate disciplinary action.

Description:

SCP-754 appears as a humanoid female with red lips and clown-like, red eyes. It wears a bucket hat with goggles on the forehead and a choker around the neck. SCP-754 often carries a cigarette, which it occasionally smokes. One ear of SCP-754 is adorned with a jade earring.

Personality:

Despite its abnormal appearance, SCP-754 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. It tends to take on more than it can handle, resulting in some humorous situations. SCP-754 is often seen trying to carry too many things at once, or attempting to fit all of its tasks into a single day. Researchers note that SCP-754 is generally cooperative, though it can become agitated if it feels its duties are being neglected or if it is not given adequate tasks to complete.

Addendum:

It is suspected that SCP-754 may possess anomalous properties related to its ability to take on tasks beyond its physical capacity. Research into these properties is ongoing.
