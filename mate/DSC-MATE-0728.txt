SCP-728 is a peculiar creature indeed. Dubbed "The Programmer Rabbit", this entity displays a remarkable aptitude for technology despite its animalistic form. With jade earrings adorning its long, pointed ears and nerd glasses perched upon its nose, SCP-728 projects an aura of intelligence and wit that belies its outward cuteness.

Observers have noted that SCP-728 appears to harbor an insatiable curiosity about the world around it, particularly when it comes to the inner workings of machines and technology. This penchant for knowledge can manifest in some amusing ways, such as when SCP-728 decides to regale its fellow Foundation personnel with obscure facts and trivia at the most inappropriate times.

While certainly a fascinating specimen, SCP-728 is not without its risks. Several incidents have been reported where the rabbit's tinkering with tech equipment has resulted in unexpected malfunctions or outright failure. As such, caution is advised when granting SCP-728 access to Foundation systems.

In spite of these potential hazards, SCP-728 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation's research efforts. Its unique technical expertise and charming personality make it a joy to work with, even if caution must be taken to avoid any accidental mishaps.
