Description: SCP-7775 is a male rabbit of average size, sporting green hair under a purple cap and jade earrings. SCP-7775 is easily identifiable by its horned rim glasses, red scarf, and a whistle looped around its neck. Forensic analysis shows traces of anomalous energy in SCP-7775's DNA, and it is believed to possess abilities that have not yet been fully documented.

Additional notes: SCP-7775 has demonstrated a keen sense of observation and a willingness to report any suspicious activity. To that end, SCP-7775 has been assigned as a traffic officer to monitor and control the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the city. SCP-7775 is authorized to use its whistle to direct and control traffic as necessary. Foundation personnel must exercise caution when interacting with SCP-7775, as it appears to have an uncanny ability to sense hidden motives or intentions.
