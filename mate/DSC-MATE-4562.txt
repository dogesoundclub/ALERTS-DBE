Item #: SCP-4562

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4562 is to be kept in a soundproof cell at all times. Any personnel entering the cell must wear sound-cancellation headphones to prevent exposure to SCP-4562's anomalous ability. Under no circumstances should SCP-4562 be allowed to attend any social events.

Description: SCP-4562 is a female human with peculiar facial features. The subject has spots on her face and a red lip. The eyes are VR Jade LED, and the head is adorned with a rainbow festival. SCP-4562 also wears a red cross earring and a medical mask. A choker rounds out her ensemble.

Personality: SCP-4562 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, the subject often indulges in frivolous activities such as dancing and engaging in silly antics at social events. SCP-4562's behavior can prove humorous but must be avoided as her anomalous ability can be triggered by sounds produced during these events.

Anomalous Ability: SCP-4562 can emit ultrasonic waves when exposed to certain sounds, which can incapacitate human beings. SCP-4562's ability is indiscriminate, and hence its usage can result in significant collateral damage. 

SCP personnel are advised to exercise caution when dealing with SCP-4562, and any accidental exposure should be reported immediately to the Site Director.
