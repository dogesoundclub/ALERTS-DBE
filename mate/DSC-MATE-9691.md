Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9691 is to be monitored at all times through both audio and visual surveillance. Any instance of DSC-MATE-9691 exhibiting unnatural behavior is to be reported to the Site Director immediately. All conversations with DSC-MATE-9691 should be kept professional and brief, and any physical contact must be prohibited. Under no circumstances is DSC-MATE-9691 to be allowed to enter any Foundation-owned properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-9691 appears to be a human male of average height and weight. It has orange stripes along the cheeks and forehead, giving it a distinct appearance that sets it apart from other humans. Its mouth is often seen in an expression of fear or anxiety, causing discomfort for those who interact with it. DSC-MATE-9691 wears nerd glasses over its eyes and a police cap on its head, making it appear as if it is attempting to impersonate a law enforcement officer. 

DSC-MATE-9691 wears a gold earring in its left ear and an LED gas mask that it wears upside down on its head. The purpose of this mask is unclear, but it appears to be a protective measure that DSC-MATE-9691 insists on wearing at all times. Despite its strange appearance, DSC-MATE-9691 has a natural charm and charisma that can make it the life of the party. It often tells jokes or performs silly dances, which has been observed to result in other humans lowering their guard around it. 

However, DSC-MATE-9691's behavior is not entirely normal. It consistently displays signs of anxiety and fear, and it is described by those who interact with it as "jumpy" or "nervous." DSC-MATE-9691 also has a tendency to fixate on real estate and has been known to attempt to sell property to Foundation personnel. It is not yet clear if DSC-MATE-9691's fixation on real estate is related to any anomalous ability or not. 

DSC-MATE-9691 was discovered by Foundation agents after multiple reports of a suspicious individual attempting to enter Foundation-owned properties. It was taken into custody and transported to Site-██ for further examination. 

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-9691's fixation on real estate, it is recommended that Foundation personnel in the real estate industry be monitored for any signs of communication or dealings with DSC-MATE-9691.
