Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6706 is to be kept under continuous surveillance at all times. SCP-6706 is allowed to continue their job as a real estate agent, but all interactions with clients must be monitored and recorded. SCP-6706 is not to be allowed to make any unsupervised visits to properties, and all keys belonging to SCP-6706 must be kept in secure containment.

Description: SCP-6706 is a female human with unusual physical features. SCP-6706 has purple lips and orange eyebrows, with her green hair not arranged. SCP-6706's forehead features two color bands, and her ears have red cross earrings. SCP-6706's appearance may be seen as unconventional, but it is not a direct cause for alarm. SCP-6706’s personality, however, has caused concern.

SCP-6706 displays a rebellious nature that goes beyond standard human curiosity. SCP-6706 enjoys pushing boundaries and breaking rules, often just to see what will happen. This can lead to potentially dangerous situations, especially when interacting with clients looking to purchase real estate. SCP-6706's behavior has been documented leading to breaches in security protocols, which have caused heightened measures by the SCP Foundation.

SCP-6706's anomalous behavior suggests the need for additional research into her mind and inner workings. Until further notice, SCP-6706 is to remain under strict surveillance at all times.

Addendum: Following a review of SCP-6706’s personality, it has been determined that additional psychological testing is required to determine any underlying causes for her behavior. SCP-6706 has been transferred to Site ██ for further evaluations.
