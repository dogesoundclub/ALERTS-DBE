ITEM #: 9886

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: SCP-9886 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with minimal furniture and no loose objects. It is to be provided with a diet of fruits and vegetables at regular intervals. Under no circumstances should SCP-9886 be allowed access to any financial resources or allowed to interact with any form of banking institution.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-9886 is a male monkey of an unknown species and is known to be a former banker. SCP-9886 is often seen with a frightened expression on its face, and it is heavily dependent on its possessions for comfort. SCP-9886 wears a doge hat with a jade earring on its left ear, as well as shade glasses over its eyes. It wears a red scarf around its neck, and carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-9886 can be impulsive and tends to act on emotions rather than logic, often leading to humorous situations. It has been observed making spontaneous decisions that other characters find surprising or amusing, although it may not always be in its best interest due to its lack of forethought.

Despite being a monkey, SCP-9886 displays a high level of intelligence and is capable of communicating with humans through gestures and sign language, although it is not capable of speech. SCP-9886 displays no anomalous abilities or actions outside of its impulsive behavior.

ADDENDUM: SCP-9886 was recovered after causing significant financial losses to multiple banking institutions due to its impulsive behavior. It is believed that SCP-9886 was using its intelligence to manipulate banking systems to its own advantage. Following containment, all financial losses were refunded by the Foundation. SCP-9886 is not to be released without the approval of the Ethics Committee.
