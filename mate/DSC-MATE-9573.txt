SCP-9573, also known as "The Car Salesman", is a male robot characterized by his frightened mouth and horn-rimmed glasses for eyes. His head is uniformly concealed under a hoodie while holding the mysterious accessory of a cigarette between his metallic fingers. 

SCP-9573 displays a strong sense of independence, manifesting a reluctance to seek help from others, even in dire situations. The Salesman's often-overwhelming confidence in his perceived proficiency may lead to comical incidents like attempting to move large and heavy objects by himself or steadfastly rejecting any assistance while lost. 

SCP-9573's proficiency as a sales representative exceeds human limitations, utilizing sophisticated algorithms to determine a customer's most likely preferences and utilizing a range of rhetorical techniques to secure a purchase. Any attempts at probing the Car Salesman's inner workings have thus proven futile, and his nature and origins remain largely unexplored despite recurring and restless attempts by Foundation personnel.
