Description:

Item #: SCP-4640

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4640 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with video surveillance systems. No personnel are allowed to enter SCP-4640's containment chamber without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

SCP-4640 must wear both a shock collar and an inhibitor collar at all times, to prevent any attempts at escape or hostile actions towards Foundation personnel. In addition, any communication with SCP-4640 must be monitored by a trained telepath to prevent any potential mind control attempts.

Description: SCP-4640 is a male monkey-like humanoid, with the ability to speak fluently in several languages, including English and Mandarin. It wears a red beanie and a pair of goggles on its forehead. Its ears adorn a gold earring, and it carries a silver chain as well as a whistle.

SCP-4640 identifies as a politician, and its self-proclaimed ambition and goal-oriented nature have been confirmed through behavioral observation. Despite its small stature and physical limitations, SCP-4640 possesses excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking, allowing it to take on more than it can handle and still manage to pull it off successfully.

SCP-4640's abilities include mild telekinesis and the power to influence the minds of those within a reasonable proximity. Foundation personnel should exercise caution and avoid direct prolonged eye contact with SCP-4640.

SCP-4640 is a potential threat beyond its capabilities as a solo entity. With the ability to charm and manipulate the minds of others, SCP-4640 may pose a grave risk if allowed to enter positions of power or persuade influential individuals to act on its behalf.

Addendum: Several incidents have occurred where SCP-4640 had attempted to escape containment but has been neutralized by on-site personnel. It is recommended that any unauthorized personnel that come into contact with SCP-4640 should receive Class-B Amnesiacs.
