Item #: 7887

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7887 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. As SCP-7887 has made no attempt to breach containment or show any anomalous behavior except for his appearance, he is currently deemed safe.

Description: SCP-7887 is a male Siberian tiger of average height and weight for his species. SCP-7887's most notable feature is his green hair kept in a purple cap with red cross earring on his ears. SCP-7887 often wears a silver chain around his neck and consistently carries a cigarette, though it should not be noted that no smoke has been observed to emanate from the cigarette.

SCP-7887 works as a veterinarian, and he is known for his empathetic and compassionate nature. However, the trait can sometimes be detrimental to SCP-7887's mental health as he tends to take on the problems of others as his own.  SCP-7887 is especially vulnerable to distress signals associated with animal welfare issues and frequently expresses a need to "fix everything and everyone around him." While SCP-7887 is amiable and cooperative with Foundation personnel, it is advised that his interactions with other personnel are limited to avoid undue emotional burden.

Addendum:

SCP-7887 exhibits a consistently frightened mouth, a trait that is often associated with animals who have undergone traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, or a prolonged loss of freedom. Further investigation of SCP-7887's past is advised to better understand his background and potential anomalous effects.
