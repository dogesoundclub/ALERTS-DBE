Description: SCP-5733 is a human male of average height and weight. The subject's most prominent distinguishing feature is its blue clown eyes, which are permanent and unalterable. SCP-5733's head is always covered with a blue bandana, and the subject is rarely seen without its silver chain or candy stick.

SCP-5733 is a skilled mechanic and spends the majority of its time tinkering with machines and tools provided within its cell. Despite being human, SCP-5733 has displayed an unnatural ability to repair and manipulate both conventional and anomalous technology with ease. When questioned about this ability, SCP-5733 has stated that its talent is innate and requires little thought or effort on its part.

SCP-5733 possesses a personality that can be described as reliable and organized. The subject has a firm routine and schedule, which it adheres to strictly. However, SCP-5733 can also be quite stubborn and resistant to change. It has difficulty accepting new ideas or experiencing unexpected changes, which can lead to humorous situations when such events occur.

SCP-5733's anomalous properties appear to be limited to its eyes, which have been determined to possess a mild cognitohazardous effect. Any individual who stares directly into SCP-5733's eyes for an extended period will become disoriented and experience mild hallucinations for a short time after breaking eye contact. These effects are temporary, and no permanent damage has been associated with SCP-5733's eyes.
