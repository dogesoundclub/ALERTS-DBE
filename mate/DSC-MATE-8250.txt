SCP-8250 is a male Tiger, standing at an impressive height of 7 feet and weighing in at approximately 700 pounds. He maintains a dominant presence, exuding authority and confidence, a perfect fit for his job as a Police Officer. 

SCP-8250's most striking feature is its Red Clown Eyes, staring out from its fierce Tiger visage with a frightening intensity. The beast wears a Police Cap atop its head, with a goggle strategically placed on its forehead. The combination of these two elements works to give SCP-8250 an aura of authority and seriousness. 

The Tiger's piercing red eyes are further accentuated by a Red Cross earring that dangle jauntily from its ears, a sharp contrast to its ferocious form. SCP-8250 also adorns itself with a silver chain, adding to its overall style and panache. 

In keeping with its job as a Police Officer, SCP-8250 is often seen donning a Normal Gas Mask. While this piece may seem odd for an animal, it only adds to the mystique of this humanoid Tiger entity. 

SCP-8250 has a highly detail-oriented personality, taking great care in maintaining its appearance and surroundings. Although this may manifest in unusual ways, such as alphabetizing one's spice rack, it only serves to heighten SCP-8250's sense of perfection and authority. 

Overall, SCP-8250 is a formidable force to be reckoned with, standing out among its peers with its striking appearance and intense personality.
