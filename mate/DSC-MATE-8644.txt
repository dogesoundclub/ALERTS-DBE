Item #: SCP-8644

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8644 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. He is allowed to work as an electrician, with close monitoring by Foundation agents. SCP-8644's orange-striped face is to be kept covered at all times when interacting with non-Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-8644 appears to be a human male of average height and build. His most notable features include orange stripes on his face, a blue bandana on his head, and green cross earrings on his ears. He often wears nerd glasses and a silver chain as accessories.

SCP-8644 possesses a quick wit and loves to engage in debates and arguments for fun. He often engages in playful banter with friends and family, and has shown a propensity for practical jokes. Despite his seemingly harmless nature, SCP-8644 has displayed a keen intelligence and cunning that should not be underestimated.

SCP-8644's anomalous ability has yet to be fully understood, but it appears to be related to his expertise as an electrician. It is suspected that he has the ability to manipulate electricity to a limited extent, although he has yet to display this ability overtly. Further study is required to understand the full scope of SCP-8644's abilities.

Addendum: SCP-8644 has expressed a desire to use his anomalous abilities for the betterment of humanity. While this is a laudable goal, caution should be exercised when considering any use of this SCP's abilities. Until the extent of his capabilities is fully understood, Foundation personnel should maintain a cautious and alert attitude around SCP-8644.
