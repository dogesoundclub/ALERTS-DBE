Item #: SCP-3290

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3290 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of its profession, access to SCP-3290 must be strictly controlled to prevent potential contamination. Any individuals who have come into contact with SCP-3290 during normal business transactions must undergo thorough interviews and psychological evaluations to ensure they have not been affected by its anomalous properties. Personnel interacting with SCP-3290 must wear standard issue gas masks to prevent any potential exposure to its LED gas mask.

Description: SCP-3290 appears to be a humanoid female of average height and weight, with visible orange stripes on its face and a purple lip. The entity also possesses a tiara on its head, jade earrings, and a goggle on its forehead. The most notable feature of SCP-3290, however, is the LED gas mask it wears at all times. The mask is capable of emitting a highly potent hallucinogen that affects human perception, leaving them susceptible to suggestion and manipulation. SCP-3290 has reported using the gas mask to influence its customers into purchasing vehicles they would have otherwise not been interested in, often leading them to take out loans beyond their financial capacity.

SCP-3290 displays a highly organized and efficient personality, which has led to instances where it takes control of group projects and events, leading to humorous situations. However, this trait can also be interpreted as controlling, leading to potential conflicts with others. Despite this, SCP-3290 is cooperative and compliant with Foundation personnel, likely due to its need for exposure to a human population to maintain its hunting practices.

Addendum 3290-1: SCP-3290 was located in ████, Texas, after reports of unusual vehicle sales practices surfaced. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate, and SCP-3290 was contained without incident. Following its containment, the Foundation has observed a significant drop in vehicle sales in the area, leading to suspicions of additional SCP-3290 entities operating in the region. Further investigations are ongoing.
