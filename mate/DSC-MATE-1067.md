Item #: DSC-MATE-1067

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1067 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel disguised as fellow employees at his place of work, a major news broadcasting company. Any abnormalities or breaches of protocol are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-1067 appears to be a human male with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth. He wears normal glasses and a purple cap with a headset, along with a red scarf and a gold earring. His forehead features a two-color band and goggles. DSC-MATE-1067's personality is characterized by extreme caring and nurturing tendencies, which sometimes extend to inanimate objects.

DSC-MATE-1067's employment as a news anchor is a cover for his true nature as a paranormal entity. He possesses the ability to imbue objects around him with consciousness, allowing them to move and communicate on their own. This has resulted in various incidents of appliances, furniture, and other household items behaving erratically in DSC-MATE-1067's presence.

DSC-MATE-1067 has shown an awareness of the true nature of his abilities, and has expressed a desire to control and contain his anomalous traits. However, any attempts to do so have proven unsuccessful, and the Foundation believes that DSC-MATE-1067's abilities may be too deeply ingrained in his psyche to be fully suppressed.

Addendum: Recent incidents involving DSC-MATE-1067's influence have led to increased concern over the potential for him to inadvertently harm others through his abilities. Further research is underway to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-1067's anomalous properties and their potential impact on the general public.
