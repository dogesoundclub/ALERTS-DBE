Item #: 6205

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6205 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, augmented to accommodate his size and needs as a rabbit. The room must be outfitted with specialized electrical equipment that are rated to withstand his power surges. His diet must be strictly controlled, and any items that may cause him to become overly excited must be kept out of his reach.

Description: Subject 6205 is a male rabbit, measuring approximately three feet in height, with red clown-like eyes and wearing a red beanie on his head. He has demonstrated the ability to manipulate electricity and has been employed as an electrician by a number of organizations in the past, though his electrical surges have sometimes resulted in damage to the surrounding infrastructure, earning him a reputation as a danger to work with.

In terms of personality, Subject 6205 seems to have a carefree attitude and enjoys taking risks, even if it results in accidental damage or injury. He often acts impulsively and without thought for the consequences, leading to many humorous situations. Security personnel should exercise extreme caution when dealing with Subject 6205, as he may pose a serious risk to himself and those around him.

Addendum: Subject 6205 has shown a surprising amount of intelligence, and may have the potential to be trained in more specialized electrical skills that could potentially benefit the Foundation. However, due to the risks associated with working with him, this is still under evaluation.
