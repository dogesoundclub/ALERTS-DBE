SCP Foundation Containment Report - Object ID: 4523

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4523 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject is allowed access to basic amenities such as clothing, books and other forms of entertainment following approval from Site staff. All clothing materials and products created by the subject are to be thoroughly examined for potential anomalous properties prior to release into the public domain.

SCP-4523's cell is to be monitored at all times by security personnel using the standard monitoring equipment.

Description: SCP-4523 is a human male of unknown age and nationality. Subject identification and origin remain unknown due to the lack of documents and records found in the possession of SCP-4523. The subject's overall appearance is consistent with that of a fashion designer, with retro cap, gold earring and nerd glasses adorning the subject's head and ears.

SCP-4523 is known to experiment with anomalous clothing and accessory materials, crafting specialist items such as gas masks that possess unknown properties. It is advised that all SCP-4523's creations be examined and handled with caution.

SCP-4523 possesses an unusual facial feature, consisting of a small spot located within the subject's mouth. It is unknown at this time whether this spot is related to SCP-4523's anomalous abilities.

SCP-4523 displays a jovial and humorous personality, often telling jokes and impersonating characters to keep the mood light. This jovial behavior has not been found to be anomalous in nature, though research staff note that SCP-4523's humor could potentially be used to mask sinister intentions.

Recovery Log: SCP-4523 was discovered on 09/██/201█ in a fashion studio in the city of New York. An anonymous tip alerted Foundation agents to the studio, leading to the discovery of several anomalous items being produced within the premises. SCP-4523 was detained without incident and was found to be cooperative with the Foundation's investigation. 

Additional Notes: It has been noted that SCP-4523's demeanor seems to change when working on his anomalous creations. SCP-4523 has been observed whispering to his creations, leading to speculation that the subjects developed anomalous properties may possess a certain degree of sentience. Despite this observation, no conclusive evidence has been found to support this theory.

As of ██/██/████, all research into SCP-4523's anomalous abilities are ongoing, with containment procedures remaining stable.  - Dr. [REDACTED].
