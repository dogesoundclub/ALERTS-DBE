Item #: SCP-8208

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8208 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a beauty salon station. No mirrors are to be present within the cell. Any cosmetic products provided to SCP-8208 must be screened for anomalous properties before being allowed into the cell. Any requests made by SCP-8208 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-8208 appears to be a human male of African-American descent in their mid-20s. The subject is notable for the presence of various spots across their face, particularly around the cheeks and forehead. SCP-8208 also sports a prominent smile and wears thick, black-framed nerd glasses over their eyes.

The subject frequently covers their head with a purple bucket hat and wears a black-and-white two-color band on their forehead, just above the glasses. SCP-8208 has a gold earring in their left ear and often wraps a red scarf around their neck.

SCP-8208 works as a beautician and has shown exceptional skill in various forms of cosmetic arts, such as hairstyling, makeup, and nail art. The subject appears to enjoy their work and occasionally hums or sings while performing their duties.

The subject has a strong, decisive personality and tends to come across as bossy or intimidating to others. However, it is noted that SCP-8208 is simply committed to ensuring that tasks get completed efficiently and effectively. The subject is cooperative with Foundation personnel and offers friendly conversation when allowed.

Addendum: During a routine physical examination, it was discovered that SCP-8208 possesses a unique ability. When SCP-8208 looks into a mirror, their reflection becomes distorted and warps, eventually allowing SCP-8208 to travel into an alternate dimension referred to as SCP-8208-A. It is currently unknown how SCP-8208 gained this ability, but research into the matter is ongoing.
