SCP Foundation Description:

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9416 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. She is to be provided with basic amenities and limited access to media pertaining to cultural norms and social interaction. SCP-9416's room is to be monitored at all times via security cameras to ensure no anomalous activity occurs.

Description: SCP-9416 is a female human of unknown age with distinct facial features. She possesses clown-like eyes with an intense crimson hue, and lips that appear unnaturally purple. SCP-9416's head is adorned with a purple cap with green hair sprouting from it. Additionally, a pair of goggles remain on her forehead when not in use, and her ears bear jade earrings.

SCP-9416 is generally docile and cooperative, but occasionally displays a more stubborn attitude when dealing with mundane tasks. Her personality is influenced by traditional values, often leading her to tell stories or jokes that have been passed down through her family or community. In contrast, she possesses a playful side that sometimes emerges, leading her to engage in light banter and lighthearted social interactions.

Addendum: SCP-9416 was recovered from a fast-food establishment in ██████, following reports from customers of a brightly dressed "clown" attempting to sell them "super-specials". Upon capture, SCP-9416 was found to exhibit no abnormal abilities or qualities, aside from her distinct appearance. Testing continues, and relevant data will be updated accordingly.
