SCP-8640: The Banker with Orange Stripes

SCP-8640 is a male human banker with an unusual appearance. His face is covered in orange stripes, and he has blue clown eyes that seem to stare fixedly at whoever he talks to. Additionally, he has a gold earring dangling from his left ear and always wears a medical mask. SCP-8640 is known to accessorize his outfits with a chunky gold chain that he wears around his neck.

Despite his unusual appearance, SCP-8640 is a highly practical and hands-on individual. He has a knack for fixing things in unconventional ways, using whatever materials he can find to make a makeshift solution to a problem. For example, he may use duct tape to mend a broken object or rig up a paper clip to repair a malfunctioning machine.

SCP-8640's pragmatic approach to problem-solving has earned him the respect of his colleagues and clients. He is always willing to lend a hand and can be relied upon to come up with creative solutions to complex problems. However, his unorthodox methods sometimes raise eyebrows, and he has been reprimanded in the past for making unauthorized modifications to equipment.

Overall, SCP-8640's unique personality and appearance make him an intriguing and valuable member of the banking community. Though his methods may be unconventional, they are effective, and he has a proven track record of success.
