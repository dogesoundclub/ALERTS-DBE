SCP-7098, also known as "The Empath", is a humanoid entity that appears to be a middle-aged farmer, wearing a standard set of farmer's overalls and a straw hat. SCP-7098 is a human male with gold earrings adorning his ears at all times. It has been observed wearing a medical mask that is donned to protect it from airborne hazards.

SCP-7098's most notable trait is its incredible ability to empathize with others. It can detect the emotional state of others with remarkable accuracy and often goes out of its way to comfort those in emotional distress. SCP-7098 has a strong sense of humor, which it uses to diffuse tense or negative situations.

Despite its apparent lack of combat training or physical prowess, SCP-7098 has a knack for using its empathetic abilities to its advantage in the field. It has been noted to calm down hostile entities and persuade them to surrender peacefully, even in high-pressure situations.

Despite being a farmer by profession, SCP-7098 has shown an affinity for urban settings, adapting quickly to the hustle and bustle of city life. It is a valuable asset to the Foundation and has been used to defuse countless anomalous incidents that threatened to escalate out of control due to emotional tension.

SCP-7098's anomalous abilities seem to be innate, and its origin is currently unknown. However, its use has proven invaluable in the ongoing quest to protect the world from the strangeness of the anomalous.
