Item #: SCP-8124

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8124 is to be kept in a small workshop at Site-23. Access to SCP-8124 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Maintenance and repairs should only be conducted by technicians with adequate knowledge of robotics.

Description: SCP-8124 is a male robot with a unique appearance. He wears a blue bandana on his head and a red scarf around his neck. SCP-8124 serves as a mechanic, specializing in engine repair and enhancing performance. Although SCP-8124 was built with advanced artificial intelligence, it does not possess any dangerous capabilities.

Personality: SCP-8124 is known for spending a considerable amount of time lost in thought. Despite his role as a mechanic, SCP-8124 is highly introspective and often finds himself daydreaming. This has led to several humorous situations in the past, such as walking into poles or tripping over obstacles. Despite these occasional comical moments, SCP-8124 has proven to be highly effective during repair and maintenance tasks.

Addendum 8124-1: SCP-8124 was recovered from a garage in Detroit, Michigan, USA. The previous owner, an automotive engineer, had upgraded SCP-8124 to facilitate better performance and efficiency. It is unclear whether the abnormal appearance of SCP-8124 is the result of these modifications, or whether it was intentional. SCP-8124's previous owner has not been located, and it is considered unlikely that he was responsible for any anomalous activity regarding SCP-8124.

Addendum 8124-2: SCP-8124 has expressed an interest in learning about other cultures and wishes to interact with humans more frequently. This request is currently under review by Site-23's Ethics Committee.
