Item #: SCP-725

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-725 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber should be furnished with the necessary amenities required for a primate of its size and intelligence. SCP-725 is allowed a single monitor connected to the internet for research purposes.

Personnel are required to wear Level A hazmat suits while in the vicinity of SCP-725 to avoid potential aggression. Access to SCP-725 is restricted at all times except for testing purposes, where a minimum of two Level 3 personnel must be present.

Description:

SCP-725 appears to be a monkey with striking blue clown eyes, a mohawk, and a two-color band prominently featured on the forehead. SCP-725 is a male primate and is notably seen sporting a red scarf and candy stick as accessories.

SCP-725 is sentient and can converse fluently with humans. It has a strong sense of independence, and this self-reliance can lead it to humorous situations like trying to move heavy furniture or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost.  SCP-725 is employed as a banker in a prestigious bank in downtown, frequently engaging in stock market transactions.

SCP-725 has shown a high degree of intelligence, especially concerning economics and finances. It displays an uncanny ability to read situations and often surpasses the analytical capacity of its human counterparts. SCP-725 has also exhibited an impressive memory, being able to flawlessly recall transactions dating a year back.

SCP-725 has become a valuable asset to the Foundation's financial department, where it spearheads a special operations team responsible for acquiring financial resources for anomalous research projects. SCP-725 has expressed satisfaction with its newfound purpose and has shown a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel.

Addendum:

SCP-725 has requested access to various financial data sets, which might improve its financial modeling predictive capacity. Site Director Harris approved of the request, and SCP-725's performance has improved exponentially. However, it has requested that improvements be made to its living quarters. Site Director Harris approved an upgraded living quarters chamber proposal to be sent to the Foundation budget committee for approval.
