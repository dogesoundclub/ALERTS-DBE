Item #: SCP-9309

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9309 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to their profession as a fashion designer, they are allowed access to a sewing machine and necessary materials, under supervision. SCP-9309 may be provided with traditional fabrics and accessories upon request, as long as they possess no anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-9309 is a female human with green hair styled in a purple cap. They are often seen wearing normal glasses and a medical mask. SCP-9309’s most prominent accessory is a silver chain, which is believed to hold sentimental value.

SCP-9309 is a fashion designer and operates under the brand name "Traditions." They specialize in incorporating traditional elements into modern fashion designs. SCP-9309 values tradition and possesses a no-nonsense attitude, often dismissing modern trends deemed to lack substance. Despite this, they have a playfulness to their personality, often telling jokes and stories passed down through their family or community.

SCP-9309's designs have been known to possess minor anomalous properties, such as the ability to adapt to any environment, resist elemental damage, or even provide minor boosts in physical abilities. The origin of these properties is currently unknown.

Addendum: SCP-9309 has requested access to traditional fabrics and accessories from their native community, which is currently under consideration. It is recommended that these requests be granted to maintain cooperation from SCP-9309.
