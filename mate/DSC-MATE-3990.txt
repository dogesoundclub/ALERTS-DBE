Item #: 3990

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3990 is to be allowed normal access to society with no limitations. SCP-3990 consistently follows a predetermined delivery route and should be monitored via GPS tracking to ensure compliance. Attempts of direct communication with SCP-3990 are not to be discouraged, but not encouraged as SCP-3990's job is to provide express delivery and may be disrupted by communication.

Description: SCP-3990 is a human female appearing to be in her mid-twenties. SCP-3990's most prominent facial feature is her bright red lipstick, which she applies multiple times a day as if it were a nervous habit. She has orange eyebrows with slight edges, and her green hair is styled into curls that twist along the edges. SCP-3990 always wears gold earrings.

SCP-3990's personality is creative and artistic. She expresses this creativity in various hobbies or interests, such as painting, drawing, or writing. It is important to note that interactions with SCP-3990 appear generally benign, but scientists hypothesize her creativity and artistic nature may manifest as anomalous activity.

Addendum: While SCP-3990 appears to comply with standard containment procedures, leadership is encouraged to continue surveillance of her delivery routes and the nature of the deliveries made. Contact with SCP-3990 should be minimized unless necessary to perform comprehensive research on possible anomalous properties.
