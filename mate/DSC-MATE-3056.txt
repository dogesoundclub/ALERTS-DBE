It is recommended that all interactions with 3056 are conducted with caution in order to avoid becoming entangled in his witty debates and arguments, as he is known to thoroughly enjoy such exchanges. Any attempts to pacify or mollify the subject must be conducted with extreme caution to avoid exacerbating his argumentative tendencies.

Description: 

3056 is a Caucasian male in his forties, approximately 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. His most striking facial features are his bright orange stripes beneath his eyes and his red clown eyes. Additionally, he has a distinct clown mouth and a police cap atop his head. The subject's forehead features two color bands, one on each side of his temple.

Personality:

3056 is highly argumentative and enjoys engaging in witty debates with his friends and family members as a form of amusement. Although he has an affable exterior, his political career involves using his persuasive oratory skills to achieve his goals, and he is known to be highly manipulative in his approach. Though charming on the surface, caution should be exercised when dealing with him. 

Addendum: 

Despite his predilection for arguing, 3056 has not shown any overtly anomalous characteristics, but we suspect that he may be using some form of unknown ability to win debates and make people question their own beliefs. Further observation and research are required to confirm these suspicions.
