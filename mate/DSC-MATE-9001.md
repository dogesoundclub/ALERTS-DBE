DogeSoundClub Classification: Euclid

Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9001 is to be stationed at an intersection of major roads under the guise of a regular Traffic Officer. DSC-MATE-9001 is to be provided with daily doses of carrots and other rabbit food to maintain its health. Standard containment procedures for a sentient humanoid entity apply. Interaction conducted by personnel should keep DSC-MATE-9001's personality traits into consideration.

Description: DSC-MATE-9001 is a male rabbit of average height, weighing approximately 1.5 kilograms. Its remarkable feature is a set of blue clown eyes that can rotate in different directions independently. DSC-MATE-9001 wears a purple cap with a headset attached. Its accessories include a gold earring, a red scarf, and a candy stick that is always in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-9001's personality makes it a valuable asset to the Foundation. They are highly organized and reliable in the execution of its duties as a Traffic Officer. However, DSC-MATE-9001 can be quite stubborn and follows strict routines, sometimes even ignoring commands from higher-ranking personnel. DSC-MATE-9001 may show reluctance to adapt to changes in its environment and may display humorous reactions to situations that challenge its routines.

DSC-MATE-9001 has displayed minor anomalous abilities, such as being able to maintain traffic flow with greater efficiency than a non-anomalous traffic officer. However, further testing is required to determine if those abilities have a non-anomalous basis.
