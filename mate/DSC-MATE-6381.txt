Addendum 6381-A: Recovery Log

SCP-6381 was recovered in 20██ from a hidden bunker located deep beneath the city of Tokyo. The SCP Foundation was alerted to SCP-6381's existence by an informant within the Japanese government. The bunker was heavily fortified, and SCP-6381 was guarded by numerous heavily armed robots, all of whom were deactivated upon the Foundation's arrival.

During SCP-6381's extraction, it activated a self-destruct sequence in the bunker, causing significant damage to the adjacent area. SCP-6381 was subsequently tranquilized and contained before it could fully escape.

Addendum 6381-B: Incident Log

On ██/██/20██, SCP-6381's containment chamber suffered a catastrophic systems failure, resulting in a temporary loss of power to the facility. Several D-class personnel were trapped in the chamber with SCP-6381 for approximately 30 seconds before emergency containment protocols were initiated.

Upon being rescued, the D-class personnel reported strange, manipulative speech patterns from SCP-6381, resulting in several mental breakdowns. All D-class personnel involved have been terminated, and a full review of the containment procedures has been initiated. SCP-6381 has shown no signs of remorse or concern for the incident.
