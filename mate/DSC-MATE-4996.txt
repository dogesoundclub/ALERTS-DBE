Item #: 4996

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4996 is to be monitored and observed only in the context of normal social interaction, as much as possible. His place of work, a beauty salon in downtown, must be regularly visited to ensure that he is functioning without incident. In the case of abnormal behavior, he is to be approached with caution by assigned personnel.

Description: Subject 4996 is a human male of average build and height, with a spot on his mouth that he habitually attempts to cover up using various types of makeup. He sports a bucket hat on his head, a gold earring in each ear, and a silver chain around his neck. He is often found with a cigarette in his hand, which he has been observed to chain-smoke.

Personality: Subject 4996 displays a unique blend of organization and spontaneity. He is a planner, always thinking ahead and mapping out timelines and contingencies. However, he is also given to sudden outbursts of irrationality, leading to unpredictable behavior. This has led to some humorous situations, but the underlying cause is still unknown. 

Investigations into his workplace have also shown that he has a passion for party planning, often coming up with last-minute ideas that turn out to be surprisingly successful. He has also been known to take his friends on impromptu outings, which have turned into adventures due to his unpredictable nature.

Further research into Subject 4996 is ongoing, as it is speculated that there may be an underlying mental disorder or supernatural element at play. Updates will be made as more information becomes available. 

Note: Personnel are reminded not to underestimate the intelligence and resourcefulness of Subject 4996, despite his somewhat eccentric and carefree demeanor.
