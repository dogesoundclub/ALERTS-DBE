[Begin Log]

DSC-MATE-6456 takes a drag from their cigarette before continuing to speak.

DSC-MATE-6456: My boss always says that we need to follow protocol, but who cares? Life's too short to follow someone else's rules. I'll sell whatever I like to whoever I like, and there's nothing they can do about it.

DSC-MATE-6456 takes another drag from their cigarette and exhales a cloud of smoke.

DSC-MATE-6456: I can't believe they think they can contain me. Maybe I'll change the world with what I'm selling. Maybe I'll help someone. Who knows? All I know is that I won't be bossed around.
