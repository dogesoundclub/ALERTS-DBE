SCP-ID#: 10

Item Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-10 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber with additional features appropriate for its species. The chamber must be furnished with an artificial burrow, including appropriate lighting, climate regulation, and fodder storage. The subject is allowed to keep its personal possessions, including a gold chain and a whistle. It is to be supplied with fresh vegetables and water every day. SCP-10 is to participate in a weekly therapy session with qualified therapists and undergo a physical examination every six months.

Upon presenting himself as a news anchor, SCP-10 is to undergo a body scan to detect any concealment or anomalies. Given its position of influence, prior to any scheduled live broadcast, SCP-10's script and talking points will be reviewed and censored by Level 3 personnel for any actions that might cause a deviation from normalcy.

Description:

SCP-10 is a male rabbit of the Oryctolagus cuniculus species. It stands at approximately 26 cm in height and weighs 1.5 kg. SCP-10's most unique features are its two-color band on its forehead and its jade earring on the left earlobe. The subject's eyes are blue clown eyes, with a diameter five times its iris size, which are proportionate to its body size.

SCP-10 is known to cause mild to moderate temporal disorientation depending on its emotional state, leading to a temporary alteration of reality in the immediate surrounding area. SCP-10's personality revolves around consistency and predictability. It fervently clings to rituals and routines to give it a sense of control within its environment.

SCP-10's current job as a news anchor follows a predictable daily routine, and it takes great comfort in this routine. Any disruption or deviation from this schedule causes SCP-10 distress and mild anxiety, leading to increased temporal distortion effects. Despite its stubbornness, SCP-10 is reliable and consistent, leading to a stable work environment for its colleagues.

Addendum:

SCP-10 was discovered on [REDACTED] shortly after causing a small temporal distortion effect in a local television studio, where SCP-10 worked as an intern. Upon discovery and containment, SCP-10 showed no signs of resistance and was cooperative in the use of amnestics for staff and local witnesses. SCP-10 was promoted to its current position after adapting to the containment chamber and showing consistent reliability within confined spaces.
