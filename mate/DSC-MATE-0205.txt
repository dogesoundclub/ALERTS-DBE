Item #: 205

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 205, identified to be a female firefighter, is to be monitored at a safe distance. Due to the possible risks involved in exposing our presence, the Foundation must avoid direct contact with 205. The subject is to be observed through surveillance cameras and any possible interactions with the subject must be authorized by Level 4 personnel.

Description: Subject 205 appears to be a human with a 90s brown hairdo, highlighted by a pair of green cross earrings. She is most notable for her infectious smile, which she often uses to diffuse potentially stressful situations. A medical mask is usually present on her mouth, which gives credence to her profession as a firefighter.

Personality: Despite being subjected to our surveillance, subject 205 continues to exhibit an outgoing and social demeanor. Her charismatic presence is known to attract people towards her, making her the center of attention in gatherings. She also exhibits a good sense of humor, often telling jokes and stories that incite uncontrollable laughter from everyone around her.

It is essential to note that although her personality traits might appear harmless, Subject 205's profession, coupled with her cheerful demeanor, could prove detrimental to Foundation activities. Therefore, she must be handled with extreme caution and a non-intrusive approach. 

Addendum: The subject's ability to elicit humorous responses may prove useful in handling SCP subjects in the future. A possible collaboration with the Containment Specialist Division should be considered to further study the subject's effect on SCP subjects' behavioral patterns.
