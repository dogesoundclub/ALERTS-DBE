Description: DSC-MATE-4821 is a male rabbit dressed in a retro cap, silver chain, jade earring, and an LED gas mask. Despite their relatively small size and harmless appearance, DSC-MATE-4821 can display a range of unpredictable behaviors, including aggression and extreme fear.

DSC-MATE-4821 is a skilled physician and researcher with a dry sense of humor. They often use this skill to catch people off guard and disarm them, making them appear far less threatening than they actually are. However, DSC-MATE-4821 can also display sudden and seemingly unprovoked violent behaviors and should not be underestimated under any circumstances.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4821 is particularly adept at manipulating human emotions and can be cunning when he needs to be. If DSC-MATE-4821 displays any sudden changes in behavior, all personnel must be immediately evacuated from the facility for further examination by a medical professional.
