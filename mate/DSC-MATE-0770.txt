Item #: SCP-770

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-770 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject must be provided with standard amenities as requested, including appropriate clothing for a Mechanic. The chain on the upper body is not to be removed for any reason, as its purpose remains unknown.

Description: SCP-770 is a Human female with an unusual appearance consisting of red clown eyes and green hair under a purple cap. Additionally, the subject wears a medical mask over their mouth and a goggle on their forehead. SCP-770 carries with her a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-770 exhibits a very observant and attentive personality, allowing them to be an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-770 can become overly concerned with providing the "perfect" gift, leading them to agonize over what item may be most suitable for the recipient.

Due to the subject's mechanical background and ability to repair various equipment, SCP personnel may request assistance with damaged machinery from SCP-770. However, interactions are to be limited to task-oriented communication only, as SCP-770 is known to become distracted and actively seek conversation outside the scope of the given task.

SCP-770 has not shown any anomalous abilities, but its unusual appearance and behavior warrant further investigation. Updates to containment procedures will be provided accordingly as new information is discovered.
