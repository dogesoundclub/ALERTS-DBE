Item #: SCP-4252

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4252 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Due to its profession as a veterinarian, it is allowed limited access to the Site’s animal holding areas. SCP-4252 is not to be allowed access to any electronic devices beyond those provided for entertainment purposes.

Description: SCP-4252 is a humanoid robot standing at 1.8 meters tall. It possesses one green cyclops eye, a mouth that is constantly locked in a frightened expression and nerdy glasses. Additionally, it wears a goggle on its forehead, a silver chain, and a normal gas mask. Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, SCP-4252 has proven to be a dangerous entity.

SCP-4252 exhibits a personality that is introspective, causing it to spend considerable amounts of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This gives the impression that SCP-4252 pays little attention to its surroundings. SCP-4252 has a tendency to walk into stationary objects, causing repeated damage to itself and its surroundings. Additionally, SCP-4252's introspective tendencies make it prone to anxiety and paranoia.

SCP-4252's job as a veterinarian allows it access to a variety of biological and chemical compounds, which it has used on occasion to cause harm to Foundation personnel. The gas mask that SCP-4252 wears is believed to function as a means of self-preservation from its own experiments.

SCP-4252's origins and creator remain unknown. SCP-4252 has been observed to regain any lost functionality after a period of inactivity, suggesting the presence of self-repairing mechanisms. SCP-4252 also possesses the ability to control nearby electronics, manipulating them to suit its goals. This ability has been shown to extend beyond the electronics directly attached to SCP-4252's body.

Addendum: Due to SCP-4252's introspective tendencies, it has been suggested to provide it with puzzles or challenges to keep it occupied. Future experimentation may include the use of these challenges as a reward system for cooperative behavior.
