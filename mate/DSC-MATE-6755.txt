Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6755 is to be monitored as a typical delivery driver in the urban area of [REDACTED]. Any anomalous behavior or activity should be reported immediately to the assigned personnel.

Description: SCP-6755 is a human female, with notable spots on her face as a distinguishing feature. She typically keeps her head covered with a Retro Cap, and wears a Medical Mask over her mouth for unknown reasons. Despite her mundane appearance, SCP-6755's personality can be unpredictable, due to her tendency to be introspective for extended periods.

SCP-6755 has a tendency to lose herself in thought, often leading to comical situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over objects in her surroundings. This behavior has been observed by Foundation agents, and is suspected to arise from an anomalous source.

The full extent of SCP-6755's anomalous properties are currently unknown, and research efforts are underway to uncover the source of her introspective behavior. Until such time as more information is gathered, SCP-6755 is to be treated as a potential threat and monitored closely.
