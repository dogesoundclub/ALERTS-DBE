Item #: 2144

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2144 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage with a minimum thickness of 5 inches. The cage must be checked daily for any potential wear or damage. In addition, the cage must be equipped with video surveillance equipment to monitor all of DSC-MATE-2144's activities within the cage.

DSC-MATE-2144's access to food and water will be provided at regular intervals, under scheduled maintenance protocols.

Description: DSC-MATE-2144 is a male tiger with a unique set of VR rainbow LED eyes and a red cross earring on its left ear. It is known for its dry sense of humor, often catching people off guard with their deadpan jokes that are surprisingly funny. Despite its humor, it is classified as a Keter-level anomaly mainly because of its violent tendencies towards any human that it encounters.

DSC-MATE-2144's abilities include the ability to phase through solid objects by passing into a separate plane of existence. This plane of existence is located within DSC-MATE-2144's body and cannot be accessed by any means outside of DSC-MATE-2144's control. Further analysis reveals that DSC-MATE-2144's unique attributes stem from their genetic material's alteration, with unknown methods.

DSC-MATE-2144's strengths lie in its enhanced agility and strength, increasing its capabilities in hand-to-hand combat. Its primary perceptive ability is sight, particularly during the night, thanks to its LED eyes.

DSC-MATE-2144's origins are currently unknown, and there is suspicion that it may have escaped some sort of supernatural containment. The DogeSoundClub is still investigating its origins and is undertaking containment protocols to prevent a security breach.

Addendum: Interview with Dr. ██████ on 11/12/20██

Dr. ██████: "Can you tell us about any strange or unexpected behavior from DSC-MATE-2144?"

Agent ████: "During a routine observation, DSC-MATE-2144 appears to have realized it was being observed through our sophisticated surveillance system. To our surprise, it moved towards the camera and stared directly at it, before suddenly phasing through the camera and disabling its feed. It's a clear show of intelligence and self-awareness."

Dr. ██████: "Interesting. We need to increase the security of the containment area to prevent any more incidents like this."

Agent ████: "Yes, sir. I will inform the security team immediately."
