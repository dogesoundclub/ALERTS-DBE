Description: SCP-5699 is a female human of Caucasian descent with spots on her skin and a smiling face. She has bright blue clown eyes and brown hair that is styled in a 90s fashion. SCP-5699 has a distinctive two-color band on her forehead and wears a red cross earring. She also wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-5699's personality is marked by a deep empathy and understanding for others. She often shows a great deal of emotion when she sees others in pain or suffering, and may become visibly upset, even shedding tears. Additionally, SCP-5699 has a strong affinity for animals and nature.

SCP-5699's anomalous properties are not fully understood, but it is believed that her emotional empathy may be connected to her unusual appearance. It is possible that SCP-5699's emotional state is connected to the emotional states of those around her.

Addendum: SCP-5699 has demonstrated a talent for public speaking and regularly appears on local news broadcasts as a news anchor. Her unusual appearance has been explained as a "quirky" style choice by her fans, and she has gained a small following on social media platforms. All media featuring SCP-5699 must be monitored and reviewed before public release to prevent the spread of her anomalous properties.
