Item #: SCP-251

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-251 is to be monitored at all times by undercover Foundation agents posing as political aides. They are to ensure that SCP-251 does not reveal any information about the Foundation or any anomalous entities. SCP-251's movements are to be tracked via implanted GPS device and they are to avoid international travel. Any attempts by SCP-251 to leave their designated area are to be met with immediate apprehension and detainment. SCP-251's memories are to be regularly monitored and altered if necessary.

Description: SCP-251 appears to be a human female of average height and weight with spots on their face and red lips. Their eyesight appears to be normal, requiring eyeglasses for reading. SCP-251's head is decorated in a rainbow festival style including a goggle on their forehead. They also wear a jade earring as an accessory and frequently smoke cigarettes.

SCP-251 is a politician and has been in office for several years. They are known to be absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time and missing important meetings. SCP-251's forgetfulness may be due to an anomalous effect, however no evidence has been found to support this claim. Foundation agents are to continue monitoring SCP-251's behavior for any anomalous activity.

Addendum: SCP-251's forgetfulness was found to be anomalous in nature. SCP-251's memories were found to be overwritten with false information to erase any ties to the Foundation or anomalous entities. SCP-251 was given amnestics and implanted with a suggestion to resign from politics. SCP-251 is now in Foundation custody as a D-class personnel.
