Item #: SCP-2402

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2402 is to be housed in a secure cell at all times outside of active duty. Under no circumstances is SCP-2402 to be allowed to interact with civilians without proper monitoring and authorization. Any unexpected behavior is to be reported to the nearest Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-2402 appears to be a humanoid rabbit standing at approximately 4 feet in height. It is easily distinguished from non-anomalous rabbits by its ability to wear clothing and accessories, specifically a police cap and a jade earring in its left ear. SCP-2402 also wears a normal gas mask as part of its standard issue equipment.

In addition to its physical appearance, SCP-2402 displays a personality that can be described as reckless and impulsive. This has led to several incidents involving minor accidents and mishaps, often due to SCP-2402 attempting to show off or impress others. It is recommended that caution be exercised when interacting with SCP-2402.

SCP-2402's current occupation is that of a traffic officer, where it is utilized for special assignments involving containment of anomalous entities and phenomena. It is trained in the use of standard police equipment and firearms, although its usefulness in higher-level security situations has not been tested.

SCP-2402's origins and abilities are currently unknown, and further investigation is ongoing.
