Item #: 4890

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4890 is to be kept within a secure facility at all times. Its movements are to be monitored carefully to ensure that it does not embark on any dangerous or unauthorised activities. All persons authorised to interact with 4890 must have previous experience with autonomous robotic systems.

Description: 4890 is a robotic humanoid with a green cyclops eye and a frightened-mouth facial feature. Its LED eyes emit a distinct jade hue. 4890's head is covered by a hoodie, and it wears a red scarf around its neck. It carries a whistle as an accessory on its person, and is aged at approximately 8 years.

4890 shows tendencies of spontaneity, with a particular fondness for taking risks and acting on whims. Its behaviour often leads to unexpected, and sometimes humorous, situations. These behaviours can manifest as spur-of-the-moment jumps into nearby water bodies or other rash decisions. 

Despite its child-like curiosity and behaviour, 4890 is steadfastly professional in its role as a traffic officer, ensuring that the rules and regulations of traffic safety are adhered to at all times. 

Addendum: Since its introduction to the procedure, 4890's actions have become less erratic. The source of this change is unknown at present time. However, further advancements with its programming may be indicated. 

DogeSoundClub personnel must keep an eye on changes to 4890's behaviour to ensure its continued containment.
