Item #: 4848

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #4848, known as "Officer Dreamer," is currently contained within the police force of [REDACTED]. Officer Dreamer is to be monitored at all times for any actions that may reveal their aberrant personality or any potential danger to the population.

Description: Officer Dreamer is a human male with a unique set of physical features. His most notable facial feature is a black spot above his bottom lip. Despite this, his smile remains one of his most significant traits. His blue clown-like eyes leave an impression on those who meet him. The parted pink hair may seem out of place, but it is nothing compared to the jade earring that can be seen as he turns his head. Furthermore, Officer Dreamer always carries a red scarf around his neck.

Officer Dreamer is known for his introspective personality, marked by his frequent daydreaming and lost-in-thought demeanor. He often stumbles into objects or falls by accident due to his lack of attention to his immediate surroundings. Despite the potential danger that such behavior presents, Officer Dreamer remains a valuable member of the police force.

Addendum: Officer Dreamer was once under surveillance due to suspicions of engaging in unlawful activities. However, the investigation concluded that his daydreaming and introspection are his most significant flaws rather than anything criminal in nature. Officer Dreamer is a cautionary tale of the importance of careful monitoring of active agents.
