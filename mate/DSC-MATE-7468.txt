SCP-7468, also known as "The Banker", is a human male with a smile that never fades and a pair of normal glasses to cover his piercing eyes. His head is adorned with a luxurious Doge hat, which seems to grant him an almost regal air. Additionally, his forehead bears a curious two-color band, indicating some kind of unique rank or status.

Despite his noticeable appearance, the real oddity of SCP-7468 lies in his affable demeanor. He is known for his innate kindness and nurturing personality, which often leads him to care for his friends and loved ones as if they were his own children. This trait can sometimes result in humorous situations, especially when he insists on taking care of people who are already perfectly capable of caring for themselves.

SCP-7468 also wears a distinctive green cross earring on both ears, possibly indicating his affiliation to some kind of medical or religious organization. And as an additional precaution, he wears a medical mask over his mouth at all times, which may further suggest that he has some kind of unique genetic condition or is vulnerable to some kind of contagion.

Despite his enigmatic appearance and personality, SCP-7468 has proven to be a trustworthy and reliable source of information and support for those in need. And while he may seem out of place in a world of urban fantasy and supernatural phenomena, his presence has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation's efforts to maintain balance and protect humanity.
