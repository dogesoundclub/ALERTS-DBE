Item #: SCP-2840

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2840 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, fitted with a sturdy, reinforced door and a locking mechanism approved by the Site Director. No personnel are to enter SCP-2840's containment chamber without the presence of at least two armed guards. SCP-2840 is to be fed a diet of fruit, vegetables, and protein supplements, and provided with enrichment activities to prevent boredom.

Description: SCP-2840 is a sentient monkey, designated as a Euclid-class object due to its abilities to manipulate its environment and craft tools. SCP-2840 measures approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighs approximately 60 kg. SCP-2840 possesses a unique ability to analyze and process information, and can recall details with incredible accuracy. This ability has been observed to be particularly useful in security measures.

SCP-2840's facial features are dominated by a pair of black-rimmed glasses. It sports a purple cap adorned with a headset, an oversized gold chain necklace and a cigarette hanging from its mouth. SCP-2840 is capable of speaking, though its vocalizations are heavily accented and often interspersed with monkey-like sounds. Despite its rather unprofessional appearance, SCP-2840 has demonstrated a keen eye for detail and is highly skilled in matters of physical security.

SCP-2840 is known to exhibit obsessive-compulsive behavior, particularly with regards to gift-giving. Although it has excellent taste and an uncanny ability to choose the perfect gift for its recipients, the process of selecting such gifts can become overwhelming for SCP-2840, leading to excessive stress and anxiety.

Addendum: SCP-2840 was discovered in [REDACTED], where it was working as a security guard in a shopping center. After a surveillance team noticed SCP-2840's unusual behavior, Foundation agents were able to relocate the monkey to Site-[REDACTED]. SCP-2840 has adapted well to containment and shows no signs of distress. Research continues to determine the extent of SCP-2840's abilities and possible applications for security and surveillance purposes.
