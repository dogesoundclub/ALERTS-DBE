SCP-2679 is a veterinarian specializing in the treatment of supernatural creatures. This charismatic human male is known for his natural charm and the ability to light up any room with his presence. SCP-2679's metal purple head, adorned with goggles, and spots, makes him stand out in a crowd.

To contain his abilities, SCP-2679 is required to wear a medical mask when interacting with non-supernatural individuals, as his natural charm has been known to cause unintended harm to those around him. He sports a silver chain as his only visible accessory.

SCP-2679's humor and silliness have been observed to calm even the most dangerous creatures, which have earned him the nickname "The Beast Whisperer" among The Foundation staff. Despite his friendly demeanor, SCP-2679's abilities and job require him to be vigilant and alert at all times.

As a valuable member of The Foundation, SCP-2679 has been granted access to necessary resources to carry out his duties with professionalism and efficiency. Any attempts to remove him from Foundation custody will be met with lethal force.
