Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8592 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. All interactions with DSC-MATE-8592 must be conducted through CCTV to prevent unauthorized emotional manipulation.

Description: DSC-MATE-8592 is a humanoid of the female sex with orange stripes across her face, purple lips, and red clown eyes. She is often seen wearing an LED gas mask and a red cross earring on her ears. DSC-MATE-8592 also wears a silver chain as an accessory. The subject's hair is styled into an orange side cut.

DSC-MATE-8592 exhibits a strong desire to make the world a better place, although the means in which she chooses to do so are often counter-intuitive. She has been observed participating in protests, staging public boycotts, and even staging acts of terrorism against companies or organizations that she perceives as corrupt or immoral. DSC-MATE-8592 is capable of intense emotional manipulation, often using her idealistic views as a means to gather followers and potential accomplices for her cause.

DSC-MATE-8592 has been documented to be stubborn and unyielding in her beliefs, often leading to violent outbursts and intense confrontations with authorities. Her idealistic tendencies have also caused her to become increasingly delusional over time, resulting in extreme bouts of violence and destruction.

Addendum: Dr. █████ has suggested that DSC-MATE-8592's idealism may be the result of exposure to an unknown memetic agent during her formative years. This theory is currently under investigation.
