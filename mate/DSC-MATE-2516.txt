Item #: 2516

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2516 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with daily check-ins from assigned staff members. Access to the chamber is strictly limited to authorized personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: Item #2516 is a male tiger with a frightened mouth expression and striking blue clown eyes. The subject's ears are adorned with a jade earring, and they typically wear a gold chain and carry a candy stick as additional accessories.

Despite their ferocious appearance, Item #2516 is a certified beautician with a quirky sense of humor. They often deploy dry, deadpan humor and make witty observations to their colleagues and acquaintances. While analytical and logical, they don't shy away from socializing with their peers and enjoy playing harmless jokes on friends.

Given their empathetic nature, Item #2516 is especially receptive to the emotional states of their clients and often goes the extra mile to assist those in need. However, they may become distressed if witness to the suffering of animals or perceived injustices in the world.

Addendum: Item #2516 has expressed an interest in occasionally providing grooming services to sentient creatures designated as Safe or Euclid class SCPs. Further evaluation of this request is pending.
