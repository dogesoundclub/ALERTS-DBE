Item #: SCP-5128

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5128 is to be kept in a standard human containment chamber with basic amenities required for his well-being. The subject is to be monitored at all times. The subject may be allowed to continue his job as a firefighter under close supervision. Any deviations in his behavior are to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-5128 is a male human with multiple distinctive features on his face, including spots and a wide smile. The subject has normal eyesight and wears glasses. SCP-5128 typically wears a red beanie, a red victory band on their forehead, a medical mask, and a green cross earring.

SCP-5128 exhibits a tendency for rigidity and difficulty accepting new ideas or changes in routine. This personality trait has caused some comical situations when the subject is faced with unexpected challenges. Despite this, SCP-5128 is typically reliable and well-organized.

When asked about his background, SCP-5128 claims to have been a firefighter before containment. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise.

Addendum: SCP-5128 has expressed a desire to continue serving as a firefighter. Due to the subject's anomalous traits and lack of certainty in their behavior, an outside agency has been arranged to monitor SCP-5128 while on duty. Any significant changes in behavior or deviation from routine are to be reported immediately.
