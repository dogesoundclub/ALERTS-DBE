Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1862 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times. Although its species is a rabbit, DSC-MATE-1862 has demonstrated intelligence and technological aptitude above that of a normal rabbit, making it difficult to predict its behavior. All of DSC-MATE-1862's personal possessions are to be kept within its containment unit and are not to be removed without proper authorization from at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-1862 is a male anthropomorphic rabbit approximately 1.2 meters in height. DSC-MATE-1862's distinctive features include a frightened expression on its mouth, a retro cap on its head, and a gold chain and candy stick as accessories. Its eyes are currently unknown as DSC-MATE-1862 refuses to open them near Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-1862 has demonstrated proficiency as an electrician, possessing knowledge of electrical engineering beyond that of a normal rabbit.
