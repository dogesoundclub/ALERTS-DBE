Item#: 4809
Object Class: Humanoid
Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4809 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no access to outside communication. Interaction with subject 4809 should be kept to a minimum, and any personal items in the possession of the subject must be screened by Foundation personnel before being allowed into the chamber. Cameras are to be installed in the chamber to monitor the subject at all times.
Description: Subject 4809, also known as the Theater Manager, is a human male with distinctive spots on his face. The subject has jade LED eyes and wears a blue bandana on his head, as well as a green cross earring in one ear. A silver chain is often worn around the subject's neck as an accessory. While the subject appears unremarkable at first glance, there is something off-putting about his presence that leaves an unsettling impression on those around him.
Personality: Subject 4809 is highly analytical and logical, displaying a keen mind for problem-solving and observation. However, the subject's sense of humor is warped and somewhat disturbing, often making dry, deadpan jokes and observations that can make those around him feel uncomfortable. Avoidance of personal connection is a notable trait of this individual, and should be kept in mind when dealing with the subject.
Note: Due to the subjectâ€™s level of intelligence, further research may be useful to determine if there are any anomalous effects present. Until then, it is recommended to maintain high levels of caution around the subject.
