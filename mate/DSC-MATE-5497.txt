Description : SCP-5497 is a male human of approximately 32 years of age. SCP-5497 has blue clown eyes and a clown mouth, which appears to be a result of a surgical alteration. SCP-5497 is typically seen wearing a hoodie and a medical mask, and always wears a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-5497 is extremely observant and attentive to details, often noticing things that others might miss. SCP-5497 uses this ability to be an excellent gift-giver, always taking great care to choose the perfect gift for each person. However, SCP-5497 can become overly concerned with finding the perfect gift, and has been known to spend hours agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-5497 is an excellent security guard, constantly vigilant and alert. SCP-5497 has never displayed any violent tendencies, and seems to genuinely care about the safety of the people around him.

Addendum : SCP-5497 was brought to the Foundation's attention after a coworker reported SCP-5497's strange behavior. Upon investigation, it was discovered that SCP-5497 had been spending an excessive amount of time purchasing gifts for his coworkers, and had been neglecting his actual duties as a security guard. SCP-5497 was taken into custody without incident, and has been cooperative with Foundation personnel since his containment.
