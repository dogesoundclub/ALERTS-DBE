Item #: DSC-MATE-3265

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3265 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. This cell must be outfitted with soundproofing material as DSC-MATE-3265 has a tendency to cry, laugh, and otherwise express strong emotions in a way that may disrupt nearby personnel. DSC-MATE-3265 must be allowed access to a record player and art supplies to keep morale high. Smoking must be prohibited at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-3265 is a human male with a conspicuous mouth spot on their upper lip which appears to be a birthmark. The individual is always seen with a cigarette in hand, regardless of whether or not they are allowed to smoke. The subject's blue clown eyes are non-anomalous and are believed to be a deformity. The gold earring on the subject's right earlobe does not appear to possess any anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-3265 works as a theater manager, however, they have displayed an abnormal emotional vulnerability. DSC-MATE-3265 is often moved to tears and expresses a deep fondness for music and art that evokes strong feelings. DSC-MATE-3265's expression of emotions can be particularly intense and disruptive, particularly in the context of a performance or event. Their frightened mouth, coupled with frequent emotional outbursts, can make DSC-MATE-3265 appear unnerving to other individuals.

Addendum 1: Following Incident 3265-01, which resulted in the death of two Foundation personnel, all smoking materials have been confiscated from DSC-MATE-3265's containment cell. DSC-MATE-3265 did not appear to resist this measure and has since become more complacent during containment. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-3265's emotional fragility remains a concern and exposure to art, music, or other stimuli that provoke strong feelings should be closely monitored.
