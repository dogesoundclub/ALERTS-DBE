SCP-1997 - Ape Salesman

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1997 is to be contained in a standard primate containment cell at Site-██. Interaction with SCP-1997 must be carried out with the utmost caution, as SCP-1997 has exhibited self-awareness and a degree of intelligence that surpasses normal primate behavior. Personnel are to wear appropriate personal protective equipment and avoid prolonged eye contact with SCP-1997. Under no circumstances should SCP-1997 be allowed access to any form of communication equipment.

Description: SCP-1997 is a 40-year-old male monkey of the species ██████. SCP-1997 exhibits a remarkable ability to speak in human language, and possesses strong marketing and sales abilities. SCP-1997 is typically attired in a retro cap, horn-rimmed glasses, and adorned with a jade earring. SCP-1997 has expressed a fondness for human culture and has adapted to the human workplace with surprising ease.

SCP-1997 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which has led to situations where SCP-1997 has taken on more than it can handle. Such situations often result in humorous outcomes, as SCP-1997 attempts to juggle multiple tasks or carry too many items at once. However, caution must be exercised as SCP-1997 has exhibited a tendency towards manipulative behavior to achieve its goals. SCP-1997's motivations and ultimate objectives remain unknown.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-1997 escaped from its containment cell during a routine feeding. Despite protocols being followed, SCP-1997 infiltrated an unsuspecting local car dealership and sold 12 vehicles during the course of the day. Local police were eventually able to locate and apprehend SCP-1997. SCP Foundation cover-up teams were dispatched, and all vehicles sold by SCP-1997 were quietly repossessed. SCP-1997 was returned to containment with appropriate disciplinary measures taken.
