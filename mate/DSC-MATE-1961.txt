Item #: SCP-1961

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1961 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a security guard at Site-███. He is permitted access only to authorized areas of the facility and is not allowed contact with sensitive material. Any emotional outbursts must be reported immediately to Site Security.

Description: SCP-1961 is a male human of average height and build. He is notable for the presence of a dark spot on his upper lip, which he refers to as his "mouth spot". This feature is of unknown origin and appears to be benign. SCP-1961 typically wears a red scarf, which he claims is a family heirloom.

SCP-1961 is highly emotional and easily moved by sentimental moments in popular media. He is known to have a fondness for music and art that evoke strong feelings. SCP-1961's ability to sense and process emotions may have an impact on his effectiveness as a security guard, and measures have been taken to limit his exposure to potentially distressing material.

Addendum: SCP-1961 appears to have an unusual effect on other individuals who come into contact with him. Several staff members have reported feeling a heightened sense of empathy when interacting with SCP-1961. Further study of this phenomenon is underway.
