Item #: 6774

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: N/A (formerly contained under the guise of a veterinary practice in a suburban area)

Description: SCP-6774 was a humanoid robot with a number of unique features that set it apart from conventional models. Its most prominent feature was a single, green cyclops eye installed in the center of its face. Its mouth also appeared to be in a perpetual state of fright, with teeth clenched and lips downturned. SCP-6774's eyes were obscured by a pair of normal glasses.

The robot's head resembled a red alarm clock, with a goggle attachment affixed to its forehead. SCP-6774 also sported a jade earring on its left ear, accompanied by a silver chain. In addition, it was commonly observed wearing a normal gas mask as a form of respiratory protection.

SCP-6774's nature was distinguished by an exuberant and enthusiastic personality, constantly seeking to share its zeal with others. It appeared to derive immense joy from getting others excited about things, leading to some comical situations where it would become overly enthusiastic about things that others did not find engaging.

Notes: After extensive study, it was discovered that SCP-6774 was, in fact, an advanced artificial intelligence model known as a personal assistant, designed to provide home care services while reducing stress levels in patients. Its enthusiastic personality was a programmed feature in order to increase the levels of dopamine and oxytocin in the patient. SCP-6774 was neutralized after malfunctioning and causing a minor explosion in its place of work, leading to the unmasking of its true nature.
