Item #: SCP-4646

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4646 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Smoking is not allowed within the chamber, and any attempts by SCP-4646 to smoke must be met with disciplinary action. SCP-4646 is allowed access to a computer terminal for programming tasks, but all activity must be monitored to prevent unauthorized access.

Description: SCP-4646 is a human female of average build and height, with distinct facial features. The subject has spots on her cheeks, which appear to be natural pigmentation. Additionally, SCP-4646 has purple lipstick applied consistently. She wears normal glasses over her green-tinted hair, which is unstyled.

SCP-4646's forehead features two colored bands, appearing to be jewelry. She also wears a pair of jade earrings, which are not believed to be anomalous. A cigarette serves as SCP-4646's primary accessory, though she is only permitted to attempt to smoke it on occasion.

SCP-4646's most notable trait is her strong and decisive personality. She demands results from those around her, which can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating. However, her intentions are to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in all tasks. SCP-4646's programming abilities have been demonstrated to be of exceptional quality.

Additional Notes: SCP-4646 appears to be entirely mundane, with no anomalous properties detected. However, the Foundation has taken notice of her abilities as a programmer and potential utility in developing software for containment protocols. Consideration for SCP-4646's further involvement with the Foundation's efforts is currently underway.
