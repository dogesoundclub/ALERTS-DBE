Special Containment Procedures: Subject 258 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to the subject is to be granted only by Level 2 personnel and above. Subject 258 is to be allowed access to a computer and programming equipment under supervision. All clothing and accessories are to be inspected before being given to the subject.

Description: Subject 258, also known as "Spots," is a human female with distinctive spots on her skin. The subject's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED technology. Their head is always adorned with a bucket hat, and they have been observed to wear goggles on their forehead, a silver chain, and a cigarette.

Subject 258 is a programmer by trade and has the ability to create complex algorithms with ease. While reliable and organized, they can be quite stubborn, often holding onto routines or rejecting new ideas. This can create humorous situations when the subject is faced with unexpected changes or challenges.

Despite their personality quirks, subject 258 is cooperative with Foundation officials and has shown no indication of harming themselves or others.

Addendum: After several interviews, subject 258 has revealed the source of their unique appearance. When they were younger, they were involved in a horrific accident that left them severely disfigured. After undergoing extensive surgeries, subject 258 opted for cybernetic enhancements as a means of coping with their trauma. The Foundation has noted that further psychological evaluations are necessary to ensure the subject's well-being.
