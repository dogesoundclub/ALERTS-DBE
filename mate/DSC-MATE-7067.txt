Item #: 7067

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7067 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with additional security measures installed to ensure its compliance. It is to be provided with at least two meals daily, tailored to its dietary requirements. SCP-7067 is not currently exhibiting any anomalous abilities, but is to be monitored for any unusual behavior or physical changes.

Description: SCP-7067 appears externally as a male Bengal tiger, with striking facial features of wide-open eyes inside normal glasses, frightened mouth, accompanied by a silver chain around its neck and a cigarette in its mouth. The subject's head is adorned by a police cap with two colored band-like decoration around its forehead. The subject's behavior is similar to that of a typical adult male human, possessing natural leadership skills and a commanding presence.

In informal conversation with SCP-7067, it has related its previous profession as that of a programmer before its transformation into its current state. The subject expresses a significant amount of anxiety and discomfort over its current appearance, as well as concerns about its future afterlife as an enormous talking feline. The subject sometimes exhibits a penchant for asking existential questions and expressing fears about its impending demise.

SCP-7067 often displays a preference for taking control of situations, whether at work, in social groups, or their personal life. It is also prone to frequent outbursts of anger when challenged or contradicted by its peers, attempting to assert dominance through violence.

Addendum: Discovery of SCP-7067 occurred after several reports were made in rapid succession from an urban area about a talking tiger wearing a police hat and a silver chain around its neck. The Foundation was alerted, and a team was dispatched to secure the creature. A forensic analysis of the subject's remains suggests the possibility of a genetic mutation, but is yet to be confirmed. Debates are ongoing on SCP-7067's abilities or lack thereof and the risk posed to the general public, but it was determined worthy of consideration provided that necessary precautions were put in place.
