Item #: 2530

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2530 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with suitable living conditions for a rabbit. Access to the containment chamber requires Level 4 clearance and must be approved by at least two senior researchers. All interactions with Subject 2530 must be recorded and reviewed for anomalous behavior.

Description: Subject 2530 is a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and VR Jade LED eyes. The subject is commonly found wearing a bucket hat. Despite its appearance as a common rabbit, Subject 2530 possesses anomalous abilities.

Subject 2530 is a master of analytical and logical thinking, often engaging in debates and arguments for fun. These arguments can often lead to humorous situations, as the subject will debate topics that others find trivial or unimportant. This behavior is believed to be a result of the subject's unique abilities.

Subject 2530 has the ability to manipulate reality in its surroundings. This makes containment extremely difficult, as the subject can appear and disappear at will. It can create illusions and change the layout of its surroundings in ways that are yet to be fully understood. This makes it difficult for researchers to accurately document and study the subject's abilities.

Addendum 2530-01: Subject 2530 was discovered at a local car dealership, where it excelled as a car salesman. Its ability to manipulate reality made it an unstoppable force in sales, resulting in the dealership experiencing record-breaking profits. Foundation agents were alerted to the anomalous behavior of the dealership, which led to the discovery of Subject 2530.

Addendum 2530-02: Due to the subject's anomalous abilities and potential danger to Foundation personnel, a proposal to upgrade its classification to Keter is under consideration. All appropriate measures will be put in place to ensure the safety and security of the facilities and personnel that come into contact with the subject.
