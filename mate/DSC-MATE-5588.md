Item #: 5588

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5588 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Additionally, no personnel are to enter the containment cell without proper authorization and protective gear. Regular check-ups, as well as psychological evaluations, are mandatory. Any deviation from his behavior patterns should be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description:

Subject 5588 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.20 meters tall. His most distinctive features are his odd, Ski Goggle-like eyes and his jade earring. On his head, he sports what appears to be normal black hair. The subject is typically seen chewing on a candy stick, a behavior that appears to calm him.

The subject has demonstrated exceptional intelligence and problem-solving skills. He typically displays a logical and analytical approach to any situation, making him well-suited for his former profession as a veterinarian. Despite his intelligence, the subject does have an unusual, quirky sense of humor. He often makes witty observations and enjoys teasing his friends in a dry, deadpan way.

The subject is not to be underestimated, as he has shown the capability to be hostile when provoked. For that reason, any contact with 5588 should be kept at a minimum. 

Despite several attempts, the subjectâ€™s origin and purpose remain unknown. It is speculated that it might have been a part of a rogue genetic experiment, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

WARNING: Any attempt to harm the subject or infringe on its freedom will result in immediate disciplinary action.
