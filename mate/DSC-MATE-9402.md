Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-9402 is to be kept under surveillance at all times by Foundation agents posing as co-workers or neighbors. DSC-MATE-9402 is to be allowed to live a relatively normal life outside of work, but is not to be allowed any access to sensitive information or areas. Any abnormal behavior or suspicious activities are to be immediately reported to Foundation superiors.

Description:
DSC-MATE-9402 is a 29-year-old female of the human species. Despite the presence of spots on its face, and its purple lip, the entity appears to be entirely human. DSC-MATE-9402 has orange eyebrows and a green cross earring on its left ear. Its head is of the witch short variety, and it wears a medical mask to cover its mouth.

DSC-MATE-9402 is known to have a natural charm and charisma that can make it the life of the party. It has a tendency to tell jokes and perform silly dances to make others laugh. DSC-MATE-9402's ability to win over others' attention is a potential breach risk and is closely monitored by Foundation personnel.

The entity's job as a reporter is a cover story for its connection to the Foundation. However, DSC-MATE-9402 has proved to be a valuable asset as it allows for an inside view of events that may be useful to the Foundation's interests.

DSC-MATE-9402's personality has not shown any signs of aggression or abnormal behavior thus far. However, its natural charm and charisma should not be underestimated and can be considered a potential threat to Foundation security.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-9402's medical mask is to be changed every 24 hours by assigned Foundation caretakers. Any attempt to remove the mask by DSC-MATE-9402 must be met with immediate and appropriate action.
