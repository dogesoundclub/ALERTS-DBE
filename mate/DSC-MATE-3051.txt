Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3051 is to be contained within Site-██ and must not be allowed to interact with any electronic devices or any other SCPs which might be susceptible to disruptive electric currents. SCP-3051's quarters must be fitted with fire-resistant materials given that SCP-3051 exhibits an inclination towards overheating electronic gadgets to the point of combustion. The containment chamber must be equipped with multiple water hoses in case of a sudden electricity surge.

SCP-3051's face features a peculiar pattern of orange stripes that run diagonally across his face, and his mouth orifice appears to be in a constant state of fear. SCP-3051's eyes are a bright red, resembling that of clowns, and his head is adorned with a mohawk of black hair. SCP-3051 possesses two band patterns in different colors across his forehead, with goggles fixed atop them.

SCP-3051 exhibits a cheerful and vivid personality, enthusiastic about anything and everything, and he always seeks to share his enthusiasm with those around him. This tendency often leads to humorous situations in which SCP-3051 gets overly excited about things without realizing that others do not share his enthusiasm.
