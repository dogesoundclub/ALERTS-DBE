SCP-5040, also known by its code name "The Monkey Delivery Driver," is a male monkey known for his frightened mouth and striking horned rim glasses. This highly intelligent creature is unlike any other monkey you have ever encountered, as it possesses a unique sense of logic and humor that can only be described as quirky at best.

Upon its head, SCP-5040 sports normal black hair with two color bands across its forehead and goggles on its forehead. It also wears a gold earring that dangles from its ear, adding a sense of swagger and attitude to its already complete appearance. Its attire also includes a red scarf and an LED gas mask, creating a somewhat intimidating look that has proven useful during its deliveries.

Despite its seemingly stoic appearance, SCP-5040's personality is unpredictable at best. The Monkey Delivery Driver has a sharp tongue and a dry, deadpan sense of humor that leaves its friends chuckling in disbelief. Its analytical skills also prove to be an asset, allowing it to tackle complex problems with ease.

However, it is important to note that SCP-5040 can easily become agitated if its orders are not followed or if it feels threatened in any way. Its fearsome gaze and imposing presence are a testament to its unpredictable nature, making it one of the most intriguing delivery drivers in the area.

Overall, SCP-5040 is a rare and fascinating creature that brings a unique skillset and personality to its job as a delivery driver. Its quirky sense of humor and analytical mind have made it a valuable asset to any organization, though it is suggested that one approaches with caution.
