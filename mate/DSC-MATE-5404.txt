Item #: 5404

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5404 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to basic amenities. Due to their tendency to become excessively enthusiastic, all interactions with 5404 must be closely monitored and recorded for analysis. A gas mask must always be available in case of unexpected behavior.

Description: Subject 5404 is a male human of average height and build. Their distinguishing feature is a VR Rainbow LED display in place of traditional eyes. The subject's head is adorned with green hair, frequently covered by a purple cap. A single jade earring can be seen in their left ear. 5404's accessory of choice is a normal gas mask, which they use as a fashion statement rather than for practical reasons.

Personality: 5404's personality is consistently upbeat and energetic, with a tendency to become overly excited about mundane things. This enthusiasm can be infectious, often leading those around them to become more invested in a topic than they would otherwise. However, this same excitement can also cause 5404 to become distracted and potentially dangerous if not properly controlled. It is recommended to avoid extended contact with 5404 if possible. 

Notes: Recordings of interactions with 5404 have indicated a possible telepathic ability that requires further study. Multiple attempts at communication through telepathy have been made with varying degrees of success. Further research is required to understand the full extent of this phenomenon.
