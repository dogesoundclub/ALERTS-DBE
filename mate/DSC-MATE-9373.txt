Item #: SCP-9373

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9373 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Personal interviews may be conducted with SCP-9373 under the supervision of no fewer than two Level 3 personnel. SCP-9373 is not to be given access to any recording devices or telecommunications equipment.

Description: SCP-9373 is a human female with an unusual appearance. She has spots covering her face, which she is typically seen wearing a bucket hat and goggles on her forehead as well as a purple lipstick. SCP-9373 also wears a choker and large gold earrings. She is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-9373 originally presented herself as a news anchor for a local television station, and was detained by the Foundation following reports of strange occurrences during her broadcasts. During interviews, SCP-9373 has displayed an intense interest in unconventional hobbies and creative pursuits, such as writing poetry, elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects.

SCP-9373's vivid imagination is reflected in her personality, as she is prone to erratic behavior and flights of fancy. She has proven to be highly resistant to typical containment procedures, often escaping her holding cell in order to pursue her interests.

Addendum: SCP-9373 has expressed an interest in performing "skits" during interviews with Foundation personnel, during which she will portray a character or act out a scene. While seemingly harmless, these skits have been known to manifest anomalous effects, and are therefore prohibited. Personnel are advised to avoid giving SCP-9373 any opportunities to showcase her creativity.
