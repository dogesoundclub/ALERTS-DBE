Item #: SCP-8197
Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8197 is to be monitored via standard surveillance methods in his workplace, an auto dealership in the metropolitan area. Interaction with SCP-8197 is limited to pre-approved interview sessions and should be overseen by at least two authorized personnel.

Description: SCP-8197 is a male human of Caucasian ethnicity, approximately 35 years of age, standing at 5'9" and weighing 160lbs. His most prominent facial features include spotted skin and a friendly smile, which are often overshadowed by the thick nerd glasses he wears. The subject's head hair is dyed green and not styled, while the ears are adorned with a green cross earring. He occasionally wears a red scarf that has no anomalous properties.

SCP-8197's most distinguishing trait is his ability to lose himself in thought. He often daydreams or falls into deep contemplation and can become completely detached from his surroundings. This has resulted in some humorous incidents such as walking into poles or tripping over objects. Despite this, SCP-8197 maintains an upbeat and friendly demeanor, even taking the time to provide emotional support to colleagues and customers.

SCP-8197 is employed as a car salesman, displaying an exceptional knowledge of his product and marketing strategies. Additionally, he possesses a charismatic persona, often convincing potential customers to purchase a car despite their initial reluctance. However, SCP-8197 is not aware of his anomalous capabilities and cannot control them.

Further research is required to determine the extent and nature of SCP-8197's abilities.
