These features include orange stripes and a permanently frightened mouth, which may indicate a history of trauma or fear. SCP-4568's eyes are covered by nerdy glasses, which they often wear in a studious manner. SCP-4568's head is shaven and resembles that of a monk. The subject has accessorized themselves with a gold earring in one ear and a silver chain around their neck. SCP-4568 is known to carry a candy stick as a personal item.

SCP-4568's personality is characterized by a deep curiosity about the world around them. They are known to display an interest in obscure and unusual topics, often leading to humorous situations where SCP-4568 will randomly spout off obscure facts or trivia to others.

However, SCP-4568's curiosity can sometimes lead them to pursue questionable research or experimentation, making them a highly valued asset but also a potential liability. As such, SCP-4568 is to be closely monitored at all times by Foundation personnel.
