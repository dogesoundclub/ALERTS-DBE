Item #: 290

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-290 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with basic amenities consistent with those of a theater manager. Access to SCP-290 is permitted to Level 3 personnel or above.

Description: SCP-290 is a humanoid entity with orange stripes on their face and a red lip, identified as a female human. SCP-290 is known to wear normal glasses over their eyes, a retro cap covering their head with a 2 color band on their forehead, a medical mask over their mouth, jade earrings in their ears, a choker around their neck, and sports goggles kept on their forehead.

SCP-290 is characterized by her strong idealism and a desire to create a better society. SCP-290 demonstrates this behavior by protesting or boycotting companies or causes that conflict with their values. This characteristic makes SCP-290 quite humorous, given their appearance and determined character.

SCP-290 is employed as a theater manager and seen as a capable problem solver in maintaining the functions of the establishment. SCP-290 has shown no evidential signs of any abnormality other than their unique fashion sense and strong activism. 

Addendum-1: Observation has revealed no indication of SCP-290’s anomalous nature, and no reports have been found of SCP-290 breaching the containment site. SCP-290 has been given clearance to perform their duties as a theater manager without any significant incidents. 

Addendum-2: An attempted narrative to bring SCP-290 under Foundation custody failed due to a legal conflict. Given SCP-290's availability to the public, the Foundation continues to monitor SCP-290’s activities; further observation is deemed necessary.
