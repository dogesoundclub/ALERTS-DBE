Addendum 9275-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/██, DSC-MATE-9275's idealism led to an altercation between protesters and counter-protesters during a demonstration concerning the construction of a new factory. The disagreement grew out of control, which eventually led to the detainment of DSC-MATE-9275 and several other parties involved.

During interrogation, DSC-MATE-9275's steadfastness in its beliefs manifested an anomalous effect upon its interviewer, Agent ██████. The subject proceeded to have a breakdown and affirmed DSC-MATE-9275's ideologies, going so far as to resign from the Foundation.

DSC-MATE-9275 was reintegrated into containment, and Agent ██████'s resignation was denied. The affected personnel was transferred to a different Site for further examination.
