Item #: SCP-552

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-552 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Any interaction with SCP-552 must be approved by a Level 3 or higher personnel. All of SCP-552's accessories are to be cataloged and kept locked in a secure locker. 

Description: SCP-552 is a male humanoid entity, identified as a beautician. SCP-552 possesses blue clown eyes, a purple cap with a headset, and a red victory band on their forehead. SCP-552 also wears a gold earring, a silver chain, and a candy stick. It is unknown if these accessories are anomalous or merely decorative.

SCP-552 displays a charming and friendly personality, often greeting others with a warm smile. However, SCP-552 has also demonstrated an eerie ability to sense emotions and predict future events, leading some to speculate they may possess psychic powers. Further study is required to confirm or deny this possibility.

SCP-552's anomalous abilities warrant close monitoring, as they could potentially pose a security risk if mishandled. Preliminary testing has shown that SCP-552's intuition is most effective when it comes to reading the emotions of others, but further testing might be necessary. 

Addendum: While conducting regular testing and interviews, SCP-552 has remained cooperative and helpful. However, some personnel have reported feeling uncomfortable during interactions with SCP-552, likely due to their ability to sense emotions in others. Personal opinion by Dr. ███████ is to treat SCP-552 with respect and caution to prevent any possible negative outcomes.
