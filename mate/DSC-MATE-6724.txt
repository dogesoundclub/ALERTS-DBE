Item #: SCP-6724

Object Class: Safe Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6724 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be outfitted with hay, vegetables, and fresh water, as well as any other necessary amenities for a rabbit. All personnel who enter the chamber are to wear protective gear and must not make direct eye contact with SCP-6724.

SCP-6724 is allowed to perform medical duties in Site-██'s infirmary under strict supervision. Any breach of protocol by SCP-6724 will result in the immediate recontainment of the SCP and the implementation of new protocols.

Description: SCP-6724 is a male rabbit with a red beanie on its head, whose eyes resemble ski goggles. On its forehead, it sports another set of goggles. Additionally, SCP-6724 has a turquoise jade earring on its left ear and a gold chain around its neck. It carries a whistle on a chain, which it uses extensively to signal attention.

SCP-6724's personality is unique among SCPs, as it possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility. SCP-6724's inclination to take on too much exceeds its physical capability of handling tasks, which can lead to comedic situations. Despite these limitations, it shows a strong desire to assist Foundation personnel in any way possible.

Subject displays medical knowledge and is capable of performing basic procedures traditionally performed by physicians on humans. Although SCP-6724 has displayed proficiency in performing medical duties, it exhibits no knowledge of any standards or protocols in veterinary medicine.

Addendum: SCP-6724 became Foundation property when it offered its services as a medic to a team of agents after they saved its life during an incident in which it was caught in a poacher's trap. Despite efforts to release SCP-6724 back into the wild, the SCP refused to abandon Foundation personnel and requested to remain at Site-██ as a member of staff.  Further study is required on SCP-6724's intellect and consciousness.
