SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-1270

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1270 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with emotional regulation and surveillance equipment. SCP-1270 is allowed access to beauty products and may be allowed to use them to maintain her appearance, under the supervision of assigned personnel. SCP-1270's medical mask may only be removed with the approval of at least two Level-3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1270 is a humanoid entity with the appearance of a female beautician. SCP-1270 exhibits unique physical features, such as purple lips, green hair in a purple cap, and VR jade LED eyes. SCP-1270 is known to adorn herself with a silver chain and wears a medical mask over her mouth.

SCP-1270 displays a heightened sense of emotions and is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or television shows. SCP-1270 also exhibits a love for music and art that evokes strong feelings. Such emotional outbursts can trigger anomalous effects, including but not limited to the alteration of the surrounding environment through a form of telekinesis.

SCP-1270's abilities are directly linked to her emotional state, and as such, it is imperative that she is kept in a stable and controlled environment. Personnel are to keep SCP-1270 engaged in activities to maintain her mental and emotional wellbeing. It is also recommended that personnel be trained in emotional intelligence to better deal with the entity.

Addendum: SCP-1270's emotional outbursts have recently begun to manifest as physical changes to her appearance. During an audio session with SCP-1270, she underwent a sudden transformation, developing a third eye in the center of her forehead. Research has yet to determine the extent of SCP-1270's anomalous abilities or the trigger that caused this transformation. Further investigation is needed.
