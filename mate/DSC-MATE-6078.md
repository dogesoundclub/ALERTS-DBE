Item #: DSC-MATE-6078

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6078 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a state-of-the-art security system. All personnel that enter the cell are to be equipped with protective gear and armed with non-lethal weaponry, as DSC-MATE-6078 has a tendency to act unpredictably. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-6078 to escape containment are to be met with immediate force.

Description: DSC-MATE-6078 is a male rabbit standing at 5'5" in height. It possesses the physical characteristics of an anthropomorphic rabbit, with fur covering most of its body, and large, floppy ears. Its eyes are obscured by a pair of nerd glasses, and it wears a gold earring in its left ear. DSC-MATE-6078 also wears a silver chain around its neck.

DSC-MATE-6078 possesses a love for adventure and thrives on taking risks and trying new things, as evidenced by its numerous near-death experiences. However, these experiences have caused DSC-MATE-6078 to become highly unpredictable and dangerous. It has been known to engage in acts of violence and aggression against both humans and other DSCs.

Despite its unpredictable behavior, DSC-MATE-6078 has displayed a level of intelligence and cunning typically associated with higher-order mammals. It has been observed attempting to communicate with personnel, albeit in an aggressive and hostile manner.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-6078's unpredictable behavior, all attempts to replicate its species have been met with failure. It is hypothesized that DSC-MATE-6078 possesses some form of genetic anomaly or mutation, although this theory has yet to be proven. Further research is required to fully understand and contain DSC-MATE-6078.
