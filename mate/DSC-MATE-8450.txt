Item #: 8450

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8450 is currently employed as a firefighter and is assigned to a team of similarly anomalous individuals. He is to be monitored at all times during shifts and is to be kept away from any unauthorized explorations or testing.

Description: Subject 8450, also referred to as "The Hooded Ape," is a male capuchin monkey standing at approximately 3 feet tall. The subject wears a black hoodie with a silver chain around his neck and an LED Gas Mask over his face. The purpose of the hoodie is unknown, but it is assumed that it serves as a form of self-expression.

Subject 8450 has the ability to use firefighting equipment, such as ladders and hoses, despite lacking opposable thumbs. His manifest ability is to manipulate flames into various shapes and sizes, dependent on the surroundings. 

Personality: The Hooded Ape possesses a rebellious personality, often finding ways to test the boundaries of his containment measures. His humorous streak sometimes leads him to intentionally break rules or find ways to maneuver around them for his entertainment. Oftentimes, these breaches in protocol are not detrimental to the Foundation's goals, but precautions should be taken to avoid contamination incidents. 

Additional Notes: 
Due to the unpredictable nature of the subject, the decision has been made to grant him limited autonomy. Subject 8450 is allowed to roam the Foundation facility, but is required to be closely monitored. Any deviation from his informal containment requires immediate response from the assigned security personnel.
