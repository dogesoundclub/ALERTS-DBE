Item #: DSC-MATE-1993

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1993, designated as a Fashion Designer, is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The use of high-voltage electrified flooring is prohibited, due to the potential damage it may cause to DSC-MATE-1993.

Description: DSC-MATE-1993 is a male robot with a single green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth feature, often wearing a police cap as its headpiece. On its forehead, DSC-MATE-1993 wears a pair of goggles while also sporting a jade earring attached to its left ear. DSC-MATE-1993 enjoys accessorizing itself as it can be found wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-1993 exhibits creative behavior, often displaying a vivid imagination used in its hobbies, such as writing poetry, designing elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. Despite its talent, DSC-MATE-1993 is often frightened and may display anxiety when introduced to new situations.

DSC-MATE-1993 first came to the attention of the Foundation when it began to sell fashion designs that often contained anomalous properties, causing sensory, physiological, or psychological effects to those who wore them. Foundation agents recovered DSC-MATE-1993 and all of its designs, but it is unknown if DSC-MATE-1993 created these effects intentionally or unintentionally.

Addendum: Despite its fears, DSC-MATE-1993 has proven to be cooperative and compliant with containment procedures. DSC-MATE-1993 seems to enjoy designing clothing for the Foundation personnel, as long as it is allowed to incorporate its unique perspective into each design. However, due to its anomalous properties, DSC-MATE-1993 must never be allowed to leave Foundation custody.
