Item #: SCP-6431

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6431 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Their belongings, including the bucket hat, choker, and LED gas mask, are to be kept in a separate storage locker. Access to SCP-6431 is only granted with Level 3 clearance and with the presence of at least one armed guard.

Description: SCP-6431 is a female human with distinct orange stripes across their cheeks. Their most notable feature is their blue clown eyes, which emit a faint glow in low light. SCP-6431 often wears a yellow bucket hat and a pair of goggles on their forehead. They also wear a choker around their neck and an LED gas mask that they claim can filter out toxins and spirits.

SCP-6431 works as a firefighter for the local fire department outside of containment. They have shown exceptional bravery and skill in their job, often running headfirst into burning buildings without hesitation. However, SCP-6431's scatterbrained nature has made them a liability on several occasions, forgetting important instructions or losing equipment during rescue operations.

SCP-6431 has also displayed an unusual ability to sense spirits in their environment, claiming they can hear voices and see ghostly apparitions. It is currently unknown how SCP-6431 gained this ability or if it is related to their anomalous physical features.

Personality: SCP-6431 is generally friendly and outgoing, but their scatterbrained nature can make them difficult to work with. They may forget important details or get sidetracked easily, leading to mistakes and delays. SCP-6431 has a sense of humor and can be quite entertaining, but caution should be taken when interacting with them due to their unpredictable behavior.

Addendum: Dr. ███████ has recommended the use of cognitive therapy and memory-enhancing drugs to improve SCP-6431's mental faculties. However, SCP-6431 has refused all treatment, claiming they do not want to lose their "unique perspective." Further testing is needed to determine the full extent of SCP-6431's abilities and to establish proper containment protocols.
