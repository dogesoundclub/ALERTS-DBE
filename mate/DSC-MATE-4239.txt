Item #: SCP-4239

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4239 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to SCP-4239's profession, it is allowed access to a fashion design studio within the containment chamber. Access to the studio must be monitored at all times by no less than two armed security personnel. SCP-4239 is not to be allowed access to any electronic devices without prior approval from Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-4239 is a human male of average height and build, with orange stripes extending from the hairline, down the sides of the face, and disappearing behind the ears. SCP-4239's eyes appear to be a pair of ski goggles, with the lenses fashioned from jade. SCP-4239 wears a medical mask atop a smile and a red scarf as an accessory. SCP-4239's anomalous properties manifest when creating designs.

SCP-4239 is a successful fashion designer of the brand "4239." When SCP-4239 is working on a new project, it becomes absorbed and forgetful, leading it to miss appointments and lose track of time. SCP-4239's creative energy is anomalous, and it alters reality, potentially affecting the continuity of time and space. Live testing on D-class personnel revealed SCP-4239's designs have no adverse effects apart from minor sensations of being disorientated.

Personality: SCP-4239 enjoys its work, and it shows in its designs. SCP-4239 is generally grateful for its containment and refrains from violence. It is often absent-minded and forgetful, possibly due to the effects of its anomalous properties. SCP-4239 is cooperative to like-minded individuals and is willing to collaborate on projects with designated personnel.
