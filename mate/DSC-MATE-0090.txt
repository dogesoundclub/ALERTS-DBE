Item #: SCP-90

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-90 is to be kept in a secure, locked room at all times. Access to SCP-90 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher, and entry to its containment chamber requires approval from at least two senior staff members.

SCP-90 is designed to resemble a robotic mechanic, and as such, it is equipped with numerous tools and implements for various mechanical repairs. However, it should be noted that SCP-90 is not a normal machine and should be handled with extreme caution.

Description: SCP-90 is a male robot with a singular, green cyclops eye and a constantly frightened mouth. Its eyes are made of a rainbow-colored LED display, and it wears a red cross earring in its left ear. It is often seen with a red scarf around its neck and a normal gas mask covering its face.

SCP-90's personality is empathetic and compassionate, often trying to fix the problems of those around it. However, this tendency to take on other people's issues as their own can lead to undue stress and exhaustion on its part. As a result, proper care and caution must be exercised when handling SCP-90.

Addendum: SCP-90 was recovered in a garage in the outskirts of [REDACTED], where it had been reported to have been fixing and maintaining local residents' vehicles without charge. Foundation agents investigated the claims and discovered SCP-90's anomalous properties. It was apprehended and brought to the Foundation's site for containment. Further investigation into SCP-90's origins and abilities are ongoing.
