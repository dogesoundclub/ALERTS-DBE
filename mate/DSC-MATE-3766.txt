SCP-3766 is a human female identified by the presence of spots on her face and a striking red lip. She wears a medical mask that conceals her nose and mouth along with a gold earring dangling from her ear. What stands out the most is the choker around her neck that appears to be an object of preference. 

SCP-3766's empathetic and compassionate nature is both admirable and unnerving. Her tendency to fixate on other people's problems in order to take care of them can leave her remaining overwhelmed and drained by the end of it. Despite her humanity, SCP-3766 can come off as eerily selfless and altruistic in the face of those who need help. 

It is still unknown whether the choker that SCP-3766 wears has any anomalous properties, but it is advisable for personnel to keep a close eye on her and monitor her actions accordingly. Any unusual activity must be reported to the higher-ups immediately.
