Item #: SCP-1039

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1039 is to be monitored at all times by security personnel. Access to her train cab is strictly prohibited without permission from Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-1039 is required to undergo monthly psychological evaluations to monitor any potential changes in behavior.

Description: SCP-1039 is a female human train driver with distinctive orange stripes on her face and purple lips. She has 90s style brown hair and wears a two-color band on her forehead and a choker as her accessory.

SCP-1039 possesses a highly idealistic personality and carries a strong desire to make the world a better place. This has resulted in several situations where she has openly protested or boycotted companies or movements that go against her values. SCP-1039 exhibits a stubborn disposition and has displayed some resistance towards authority during initial interviews.

SCP-1039 exhibits no signs of any abnormal physical abilities. However, she has reported experiencing occasional visions that appear to be premonitory in nature. These visions appear to be triggered by specific events or situations.

SCP-1039 was discovered during a train accident where she operated the locomotive involved. Witnesses reported seeing her talking to an apparition before the collision occurred. Foundation personnel promptly took her into custody and identified her as an SCP.

Further investigation determined that SCP-1039's visions are unrelated to any anomalous events or objects within the train's immediate vicinity.

Addendum: SCP-1039 has requested the use of her trains for humanitarian purposes on various occasions. While her requests are still under review, Foundation personnel have noted that her idealism may have potential benefits to the Foundation's mission.
