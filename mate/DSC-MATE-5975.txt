Item #: SCP-5975

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5975 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-5975's containment chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, with a mandatory psychological evaluation thereafter.

Description: SCP-5975 is a male monkey of the macaque species and works as a news anchor. Its humanoid features resemble that of a cartoon character, with ski goggle eyes and a frightened mouth. SCP-5975 also wears a hoodie with a red scarf as its accessory.

SCP-5975 possesses a quick wit and loves to engage in debates with friends and family, even engaging in playful arguments for fun. However, SCP-5975's personality can be unpredictable and at times, aggressive. It has been observed to throw objects when provoked, causing damage to its surroundings.

SCP-5975's news broadcasts often contain subtle hints of anti-establishment messages, leading researchers to believe that it may have a hidden agenda. Further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Addendum 5975-1: Incident Log 5975-1

On ██/██/████, SCP-5975 managed to escape containment by stealing a master keycard from an unaware researcher. SCP-5975 was found later that day, giving a public speech on the street corner, attempting to rally a group of civilians into a protest.

All civilians present were administered amnestics, and SCP-5975 was sedated and safely returned to its containment cell. Supervisors have since implemented stricter security measures to prevent further breaches.

Addendum 5975-2: Interview Log 5975-2

Interviewed: SCP-5975

Interviewer: Dr. ██████

Foreword: Interview conducted following Incident Log 5975-1.

<Begin Log, ██/██/████>

Dr. ██████: SCP-5975, do you understand the danger you pose to society with your anti-establishment messages?

SCP-5975: (Laughs) What danger? I'm just having a little fun.

Dr. ██████: Stealing a keycard and fleeing containment is not just having "a little fun," SCP-5975.

SCP-5975: (Rolls its eyes) Yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, I just want to live my life, and I don't see what's wrong with a little protest here and there.

Dr. ██████: Protest against what, exactly?

SCP-5975: Against the oppressive system that wants to keep us all down. Don't you see it? The government, the corporations, they're all working together to keep the majority of the population powerless and impoverished. We need change, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

Dr. ██████: And what happens after the change you seek is achieved?

SCP-5975: (Shrugs) Who knows? Maybe we'll finally have a society that values individual freedom and equality. Or maybe it all falls apart. But at least we'll have tried.

<End Log, ██/██/████>

Closing Statement: This interview revealed SCP-5975's underlying motives and ideologies. Further research must be conducted to determine the extent of SCP-5975's potential threat to society.
