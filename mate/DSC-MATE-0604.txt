SCP-604, also known as "The Reporter," is a male monkey that possesses a unique forehead feature consisting of two distinct bands of color. Additionally, this primate sports an impressive golden earring on each of its ears, giving it a certain level of panache. However, what stands out most about this ape is the red scarf it wears around its neck and the normal gas mask it dons when exposed to certain air-born anomalies.

The Reporter is a highly curious and inquisitive creature, showing a deep interest in the workings of the world around it. It can often be found exploring new places, learning obscure facts, and sharing this information with those who will listen. Though it may come off as quirky or eccentric at times, The Reporter's personality is generally upbeat and lighthearted, bringing bits of levity to even the most intense situations.

However, it's worth noting that this monkey's inquisitiveness can sometimes lead them into risky situations. Driven by the desire to acquire new information and knowledge, The Reporter has been known to venture into zones that are restricted, hazardous, or downright dangerous without proper protocol. As such, it is advised that any personnel interacting with SCP-604 keep a close eye on its movements and use caution when dealing with its curiosity-driven impulses.

Overall, The Reporter is a curious and amiable creature that can provide valuable insights and information to its handlers. With proper guidance and supervision, it can be a valuable asset to any team working in the field of urban fantasy research.
