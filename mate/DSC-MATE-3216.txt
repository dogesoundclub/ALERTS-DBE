SCP-3216 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. They should be allowed access to police equipment and given special training in detecting and handling anomalous activity.

Description:

SCP-3216 is a human female with several unusual features. Their skin displays a pattern of spots across their face, and their eyes appear to be VR Jade LED. SCP-3216's hair is arranged into two pigtail braids and is usually styled in bright colors. They further accessorize with a silver chain, green cross earrings, and a normal gas mask.

SCP-3216's personality is ambitious and career-focused. They exhibit a strong drive towards achieving their goals, often leading them to take on more than they can handle. However, their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills enable SCP-3216 to complete their objectives with ease.

SCP-3216 was discovered during a routine investigation of a local police department. The Foundation became aware of SCP-3216's anomalous features after observing them handling a situation with supernatural creatures with apparent ease.

SCP-3216 has been granted access to the Foundation's resources as part of their work as a police officer. SCP-3216's skills and determination have made them a useful asset in combating anomalous activity, and their containment is currently considered successful.
