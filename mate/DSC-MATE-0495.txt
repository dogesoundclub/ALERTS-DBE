SCP-495, also known as "The Show-Off," is a human male identified as a news anchor. Their appearance is distinct, with ski goggle-like eyes, a bucket hat atop their head, and gold earrings as their ears. A gold chain adorns their neck, serving as yet another display of their flashy nature.

However, The Show-Off's personality is just as distinctive as their appearance. They are known to be reckless, often diving headfirst into situations without thinking them through. This leads to humorous mishaps, such as minor accidents or other situations that arise from trying to impress those around them. Their unbridled nature and lack of caution can make them a liability in certain situations.

Despite their shortcomings, The Show-Off has a certain charm about them. They are able to captivate an audience with their charismatic nature and are often the life of the party. However, their tendency to put on a show has landed them in hot water more than once, making them a liability for the Foundation.

Due to their reckless tendencies, it is imperative that The Show-Off be closely monitored and kept away from situations where their behavior could result in serious harm. While their personality can be entertaining, it is not worth endangering the safety of others.
