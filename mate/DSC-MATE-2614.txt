SCP Identification #: 2614

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2614 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment room at Site-██. Access is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-2614 must be conducted with caution and under the supervision of at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-2614 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. The subject is a licensed veterinarian, possessing advanced knowledge of animal anatomy, medicine, and behavior. SCP-2614 appears to be in his late 30s and stands at a height of 5'10" (177.8 cm).

SCP-2614's most notable feature is his purple metal head, which is made of an unknown metallic substance. SCP-2614 claims that his head was fully metallic before he became a veterinarian, but the Foundation has yet to confirm this. SCP-2614's ears are adorned with a gold earring, and he wears a standard surgical mask over his mouth.

In addition to his unique appearance, SCP-2614 carries a silver chain with him at all times, which he claims is a good luck charm. He often uses the chain to playfully fidget with when he's not busy, but it does not appear to have any anomalous properties.

SCP-2614 is a responsible and dutiful individual, with a strong sense of duty towards animals and their well-being. However, he has a tendency to take on more than he can handle, often resulting in humorous situations. SCP-2614 can be seen trying to fit all of his tasks in a single day or carrying too many items at once.

Addendum: SCP-2614 has not exhibited any anomalous properties or behavior beyond his unique appearance. However, due to the unknown nature of his metallic head, further research and experimentation are underway.
