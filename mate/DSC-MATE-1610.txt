Item #: SCP-1610

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1610 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with additional accommodations for their tiger physiology. The subject is not to be allowed out of its cell except under controlled circumstances approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any fashion designs or accessories created by SCP-1610 must be inspected and approved by senior personnel before being released to the general public.

Description: SCP-1610 is a male tiger with the physical appearance of a human, including the ability to speak and make use of opposable thumbs. Its head is adorned with a "Doge" hat, and it wears a gold earring in one ear. SCP-1610 is often seen wearing a red scarf as an accessory.

Despite its fierce appearance, SCP-1610 presents a rather timid personality, with a frightened mouth as its prominent facial feature. It is often described as absent-minded and forgetful, particularly when busy working on projects. This forgetfulness sometimes leads to humorous situations where SCP-1610 forgets appointments or misses important events due to losing track of time.

It has been discovered that SCP-1610 possesses a talent for fashion design, and has produced clothing and accessories for several high-end designers. Its designs have garnered attention and acclaim in the fashion industry, but all items made by SCP-1610 must be thoroughly inspected and approved by Foundation personnel before being released for public use.

Addendum 1610-1: SCP-1610's forgetfulness appears to be a byproduct of its talent in fashion design. The subject becomes deeply invested in its work, often to the point of losing track of external events. Foundation staff members have noted an improvement in SCP-1610's memory when put on a strict production schedule.

Addendum 1610-2: SCP-1610 has been found to be vulnerable to certain prey instincts. Supervisors are reminded to avoid loud or sudden noises around the subject, and to prevent the introduction of live prey into the area for any reason.
