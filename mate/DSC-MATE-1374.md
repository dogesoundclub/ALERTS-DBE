Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1374 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any interaction with subject 1374 must be approved by Level 3 personnel or above.

Description: Subject 1374 appears to be a male Siberian tiger except for the fact that he possesses green hair in a purple cap and a gold earring on his left ear. He is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck and a normal gas mask for safety. Despite these unusual traits, subject 1374 has the ability to transform into a human form for extended periods, allowing him to blend in with human society. He works as a real estate agent during the day.

Subject 1374 has shown empathetic and compassionate tendencies, often taking on others' problems as if they are his own. This trait can be both admirable and incredibly exhausting for subject 1374. He struggles to balance his innate desire to help others with the harsh reality that he is a predator at heart, which often leads him to take reckless actions.

Addendum 1374-A: Subject 1374 has been involved in multiple incidents where he has used excessive force to protect innocent bystanders. In one instance, subject 1374 mauled a group of attackers who were attempting to rob a convenience store. While subject 1374's actions ultimately helped to prevent the robbery, they resulted in the death of two of the attackers. Further observation is necessary to determine the extent of subject 1374's abilities and any potential risks they may pose.
