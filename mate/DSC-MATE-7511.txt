Item #: SCP-7511

Object class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7511 is to be employed in the Traffic Department of the local police station as a Traffic Officer. The individual's working hours are to be scheduled between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM, Monday to Friday. Any work outside these hours will require special permission from the Site Director. SCP-7511 is to be provided with a special candy stick as a stress-relief mechanism while on duty. 

SCP-7511's uniform has been tailored to accommodate its physical features. Wearing a retro cap and a red scarf is essential for maximizing its efficiency at work. A gold earring is also present on its left ear, which has no scientific importance but does make SCP-7511 feel more confident. SCP-7511 is not allowed to wear any accessories other than the mentioned ones during work hours.

SCP-7511 is not to be exposed to any kind of physical danger or extreme stress, especially in the presence of other individuals. Proper counseling should be provided in case SCP-7511 faces any traumatic events.

Description: SCP-7511 is a male rabbit. It has a frightened mouth and wears normal glasses. SCP-7511 tends to speak in a nervous and rapid tone, and its speech patterns indicate a strong sense of independence. SCP-7511 may not ask for help even in situations where help is needed. SCP-7511's stubbornness has resulted in many humorous situations, such as refusing to take directions or attempting to move a heavy object alone. SCP-7511 appears to be quite fond of candy sticks, and consuming them has been shown to relieve the individual's stress.

SCP-7511's personality is unique, as it exhibits traits commonly observed in both humans and rabbits. SCP-7511 appears to be extremely vigilant and attentive to its job as a traffic officer, and its ability to recognize traffic patterns and maintain order makes it a valuable asset to the department.

Addendum: SCP-7511 was brought to the Foundation's attention after multiple reports of a "talking rabbit traffic officer" were received by the police department. After questioning and subsequent testing, SCP-7511 was moved to an appropriate containment facility. After extensive research, it was decided that SCP-7511 would be allowed to continue its work as a traffic officer, with necessary measures taken to ensure it can perform its duties without endangering itself or others.
