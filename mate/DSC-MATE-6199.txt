Item #: SCP-6199

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6199 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The subject is allowed to retain their job as a mechanic within the Foundation's facilities, under the condition that they are not permitted to work on any anomalous vehicles or machinery. Communication with SCP-6199 is to be conducted only with prior approval from the site director.

Description: SCP-6199 is a humanoid with bright orange stripes along their cheeks and forehead. They present as a human female in their early twenties, with brown hair typically worn under a hoodie. SCP-6199 is often seen wearing a silver chain and normal glasses.

SCP-6199 displays a quick wit and love of debate, often engaging in playful arguments with those around them for entertainment. They possess a charismatic personality and a contagious smile, which has been known to disarm and charm those they interact with.

Despite their playful nature, SCP-6199 has a natural curiosity about the workings of complex machines, often tinkering with various mechanical devices in their spare time. As such, they have been employed as a mechanic on Foundation equipment. However, due to the inherent danger in allowing SCP-6199 to work on anomalous machinery, they are restricted to standard non-anomalous equipment.

 SCP-6199 has been compliant with Foundation personnel and has demonstrated no anomalous abilities. They have expressed a desire to help contain and protect anomalies, and as such, have been cooperative with containment efforts. 

Addendum: SCP-6199 is permitted two hours of recreational time each day to engage in debates with Foundation personnel, under the supervision of a designated staff member. This time is authorized as a measure to maintain positive morale among containment personnel.
