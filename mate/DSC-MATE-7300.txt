SCP-7300's personality presents itself as accommodating and relaxed, but underneath the surface lies an unwavering commitment to loyalty and protection towards its companions. Be warned that SCP-7300 will not hesitate to express its fierce loyalty by engaging in intense arguments with anyone who dares to insult or undermine its loved ones. 

The Security Guard's behavior typically manifests in humorous situations, with its easy-going appearance belying the ferocity of its protection.
