Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3342 is to be kept in a reinforced containment chamber at all times. Access to this chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-3342 must be done via remote observation cameras and no direct physical interaction is permitted. SCP-3342 is to be provided with a diet consisting of fresh vegetables and fruit to maintain its health.

Description: SCP-3342 appears to be a normal rabbit wearing a red beanie on its head, a gold earring on its left ear, and a silver chain around its neck. Its eyes are VR jade LED, which can change colors based on the rabbit's mood or state of anger. SCP-3342 displays a highly analytical and logical personality, but also exhibits wit and humor, often making dry quips and observations.

SCP-3342's capabilities extend beyond that of a normal rabbit. It has the ability to manipulate electronic devices within its proximity, causing them to malfunction or operate according to its will. Research is ongoing to determine the limits of this ability.

SCP-3342 has been observed to exhibit signs of aggression when provoked, displaying a viciousness not typical of rabbits. It is recommended that all personnel exercise extreme caution when in close proximity to SCP-3342.

Addendum: SCP-3342 was recovered from an abandoned laboratory, where it was used in experiments to test the effects of electronic manipulation on animal behavior. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the exact nature of these experiments and any potential implications for SCP-3342's abilities.
