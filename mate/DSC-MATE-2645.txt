SCP-2645 is a robotic creation, built with state-of-the-art technology and tasked with maintaining security at all times. He stands at an imposing 6'7", his sleek metallic form boasting finely-honed features that speak of his advanced design. The robot's face, however, reveals a different story.

SCP-2645 exhibits a permanently frightened look on his mouth, while his eyes are replaced by ski goggles, giving him an almost comical visage. Atop his head rests a doge hat, with golden earrings hanging from his ears, further adding to the absurdity of his appearance. He also wears a gold chain around his neck and carries a whistle, indicative of his role as a security guard.

Despite his comical appearance, SCP-2645 boasts an energetic and enthusiastic personality. He enjoys getting others excited about their work and can often be overzealous in his efforts. This can lead to some humorous situations where SCP-2645 becomes overly excited about something that others don't find as interesting.

SCP-2645 is a valuable asset to any team, delivering both professionalism and levity in equal measure. However, he also requires close monitoring to ensure that his exuberance does not impact his ability to perform his critical security duties.
