Item #: DSC-MATE-7864

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7864 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit located at Site-██. DSC-MATE-7864's cell is to contain an ample amount of dried meat snacks and candy sticks to prevent occurrences of extreme aggression or agitation.

DSC-MATE-7864, a tiger of unknown origin, is to be constantly monitored for any signs of anomalous behavior, with daily check-ups by on-site personnel. Physical and psychological evaluations must be conducted on the specimen once every six months.

DSC-MATE-7864 is currently employed as a security guard at Site-██. While on duty, DSC-MATE-7864 must be accompanied by at least one armed guard at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-7864 is a male tiger with characteristic blue bandana and red cross earring on its left ear. The specimen's physical attributes are consistent with that of a common Bengal tiger, with no apparent anomalies in its biology or physiology. DSC-MATE-7864 weighs approximately 180kg and stands at a height of 2.1m.

Aside from its physical descriptions, DSC-MATE-7864 possesses a somewhat jovial and impulsive personality, which sometimes results in unexpected behavior. Its tendency to act on emotions or instincts, rather than 'thinking through' its actions, has been documented in previous reports. DSC-MATE-7864 is known to make spontaneous decisions, which often surprises or amuses those around it.

However, this behavior also means that DSC-MATE-7864 can sometimes exhibit signs of aggression, especially when provoked or teased. In such cases, it becomes overly territorial and exceptionally strong, being able to overpower multiple agents at once.

Regardless of its impulsive nature, DSC-MATE-7864 is considered to be a cooperative entity with a good relationship with the Site-██ staff. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-7864 is not to be left unsupervised at any time, and interactions with the entity must be conducted with caution.

Addendum: During routine evaluations, personnel noted that DSC-MATE-7864 had begun to show signs of increased aggression and unpredictability, potentially due to prolonged confinement. Further experimentation on DSC-MATE-7864's behavior and possible relocation to a larger containment unit is under consideration.
