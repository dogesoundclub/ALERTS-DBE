Item #: 5068

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5068 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. No special precautions are necessary for the containment of the subject. Access to the subject is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or above.

Description: Subject 5068 is a human female in her late thirties, with distinctive spots on her face as its prominent feature. Her eyebrows are a piercing shade of orange and her head is adorned with short, witch-like hair. She bears a colorful 2 color band along her forehead and a green cross earring on each ear. Two accessories of note include a silver chain necklace and a normal gas mask that she wears as a precaution while in populated areas.

Subject 5068 is a banker by profession, but her personality takes on an idealistic approach. She strongly desires to create a better world for all individuals by protesting against entities or companies that go against her values. Her whimsical personality has led her to several humorous situations, not the least of which includes her involvement in isolated demonstrations.

Subject 5068 has shown no signs of hostility and has willingly cooperated with Foundation staff. Routine psychological evaluations have revealed no indications of abnormal behavior or traits. The subject's containment cell is equipped with standard amenities to ensure their comfort and well-being during long-term containment.

Addendum: Subject 5068 has been granted limited access to the Foundation's library, as the subject has shown a keen interest in the development of magical theory and practice. Her reasoning and enthusiasm towards this field have given researchers interesting leads for further study. However, access to certain tomes and books that might pose risks to Site-██ and the Foundation are restricted to high-clearance personnel.
