Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6172 is to be held in a standard containment chamber equipped with reinforced walls and heavy-duty locks. The chamber is to be regularly checked for any signs of wear and tear, as well as for any potential escape routes that DSC-MATE-6172 might attempt to use.

DSC-MATE-6172 is to be provided with a diet consisting primarily of raw meat, and must be kept in a temperature-controlled environment to ensure its comfort. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-6172 must be approved by at least two Level-3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-6172 is a male Bengal tiger, estimated to be around 6 years old. Its most notable features are its unique, ski-goggle shaped eyes, which glow a bright orange. DSC-MATE-6172 also wears a police cap atop its head and a gold earring through its left ear.

DSC-MATE-6172's most unusual feature is the medical mask covering its snout. The mask is affixed with sturdy straps that wind around its head, keeping it firmly in place. Though it has never been observed undergoing any medical procedures, DSC-MATE-6172 will become agitated and aggressive if its mask is removed.

Personality: DSC-MATE-6172 is a highly intelligent and independent creature with a rebellious streak. It often tests its boundaries and willfully violates rules, purely for the sake of seeing what will happen. This independent streak has occasionally led to humorous situations, such as instances where DSC-MATE-6172 has deliberately broken containment protocols or found creative ways to escape its enclosure.

DSC-MATE-6172 tends to be rather aloof in its interactions with humans, showing little interest or concern for their presence. However, it becomes highly territorial and aggressive if it perceives any threat to its safety or well-being. DSC-MATE-6172 has been observed engaging in bouts of playfulness with its handlers and even seems to enjoy human interaction, so long as it is on its own terms.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6172 is believed to possess highly advanced cognitive abilities, as evidenced by its ability to learn and use tools. While it has not yet been observed using spoken language, some researchers speculate that it may be capable of understanding human speech. Further study is required to confirm this theory.
