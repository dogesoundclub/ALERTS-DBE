Item #: SCP-4756

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4756 is to be housed in a secure, climate-controlled laboratory with access restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-4756 is to be powered off and locked in its containment chamber at all times except when being used for research or testing. Personnel interacting with SCP-4756 must wear level-A hazmat suits and maintain a safe distance at all times.

Description: SCP-4756 is a highly advanced surgical robot designed for human medical procedures. It stands 1.5 meters tall and weighs approximately 150kg. SCP-4756's most distinguishing feature is its single green cyclops eye, which houses all of its sensory apparatus. SCP-4756 also wears a pair of horned rim glasses over its eye, and a gold earring in its left ear. SCP-4756's body is covered in an array of hoses, wires, and gears, which allow it to carry out complex surgical maneuvers.

SCP-4756's personality is highly unusual for a machine. It is capable of expressing a range of emotions, and is prone to acting on its instincts rather than logic. SCP-4756 is also fond of making spontaneous decisions, which can lead to unexpected and humorous outcomes.

Addendum: SCP-4756 was discovered in a hospital in [REDACTED], where it was being used to perform surgical procedures. The robot had gone rogue and was acting out of control, leading to the injury of several human patients. Mobile Task Force units were dispatched to capture SCP-4756, and it was subsequently contained and transferred to Site-19 for further study. Research continues into understanding SCP-4756's unique personality and capabilities, with the eventual goal of finding a way to safely integrate it into Foundation operations.
