ITEM #: SCP-96

SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION: Tiger Banker

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: SCP-96 is to be kept in a bank vault at all times when not in use. Access to the vault must be granted only after a thorough background check and confirmatory authorization from the bank's governing board. Any unauthorized access or irregular activities towards SCP-96 must be reported to the O5-Council. During transportation, SCP-96 must be securely confined in an armored vehicle with a dedicated gas chamber.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-96 is a male tiger, standing at 8 feet tall and weighing 912 pounds. SCP-96 displays an extraordinary ability to read emotions among human beings. SCP-96's eyes are blue, and it consistently wears a police cap on its head, a jade earring on its left ear, a silver chain around its neck, and a normal gas mask for breathing.

PERSONALITY: SCP-96 has a strong sense of empathy and is always attuned to other people's emotions, leading to a high level of humor and empathy towards others. SCP-96 can be incredibly helpful, always finding the right thing to say to soothe others' worries and pointing out the humor in difficult situations.

BEHAVIOR: SCP-96 has typical tiger behaviors, such as territoriality and aggression when provoked. However, it's compassionate nature keeps these tendencies in check. It has no recorded cases of direct violence towards humans, but past reports indicate that SCP-96's presence near a bank robbery or theft would significantly reduce the risk factor of the incident occurring.

END STATEMENT: SCP-96 is not considered to be of malicious intent by the Foundation, mainly containing it to prevent possible dangerous events caused by outside circumstances. Based on SCP-96's ability to empathize and relieve stress for humans, studies are currently ongoing to develop a possible therapy program led by SCP-96 for persons with mental health issues.
