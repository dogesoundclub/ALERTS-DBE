Item #: SCP-6327

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-6327 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. All personnel assigned to SCP-6327 must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation prior to duty shifts. Any personnel displaying aggressive behavior towards SCP-6327 are to be reassigned immediately.

Description:

SCP-6327 appears to be a female human in her mid-thirties and works as a news anchor for a local television station. She stands at 5’5” and weighs approximately 145 pounds. SCP-6327 has several unique facial features, including spots on her skin and a purple lip color. Her eyes are orange, and her forehead has a goggle attachment on it. She also wears a green cross earring and a medical mask over her mouth.

Despite her unusual appearance, SCP-6327's most remarkable feature is her personality. She is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with creative solutions to problems. SCP-6327's humor can be described as quirky, and she often suggests outlandish solutions just to see how others react.

SCP-6327 has shown no anomalous behavior, and her abilities are currently unknown. However, all contact with SCP-6327 is to be monitored, and no personnel are to interview her without proper clearance.

Addendum:

On ██/██/████, during a routine interview for a news segment, SCP-6327 displayed an ability to influence the thoughts and actions of her interviewer. This ability appeared to be involuntary, and SCP-6327 showed no awareness of it. Research is ongoing, and additional precautions have been implemented.
