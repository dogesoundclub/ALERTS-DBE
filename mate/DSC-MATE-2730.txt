Item #: 2730

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2730, designated as "the Beautician", shall be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber shall be equipped with a ventilation system capable of handling the toxic fumes emanating from the subject's LED gas mask. All personnel entering the chamber must wear the appropriate personal protective equipment, including gas masks and gloves.

Description: Subject 2730 is a male monkey standing at 1.2 meters tall, weighing 40 kilograms, and possessing blue clown eyes and a parted pink head. One of its unique features is its jade earring, which adorns its left ear. Subject 2730's access to art supplies and lack of interest in grooming itself have led to a ruffled and unkempt appearance. When frightened or distressed, the subject's mouth may open to an exaggerated degree.

Despite its appearance, subject 2730 is highly intelligent and attuned to the intricacies of human beauty and hygiene. It has mastered a variety of hairstyling, makeup, and skincare techniques and is known to have transformed the appearance of numerous D-Class personnel preceding their termination. Subject 2730 has shown interest in research and has amassed a collection of books and documents relating to beauty, grooming, and exotic cultures.

Subject 2730 has a highly opinionated and argumentative disposition, often engaging in debates over the merits of various beauty products and techniques with Foundation researchers. It never misses an opportunity to share its newfound knowledge with others, often appearing as an eager and enthusiastic teacher. Despite its highly developed social and cognitive faculties, Subject 2730 has not developed language and communicates through a series of grunts, gestures, and facial expressions.

Addendum: The subject requested access to a large quantity of hair and beauty products in order to "show humanity the true meaning of beauty", but the request has been denied due to safety concerns.
