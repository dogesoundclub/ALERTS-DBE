Item #: SCP-9572

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-9572 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel and above with the approval of the Site Director.

Description:
SCP-9572 is a female human of approximately 30 years of age, measuring 175 centimeters in height and weighing 75 kilograms. They possess distinctly unique physical traits, including orange stripes on their cheeks and forehead, and vibrant VR rainbow LED eyes. SCP-9572's head is always covered by a white hoodie with the words "Always Be Yourself" prominently printed on the front.

SCP-9572 is often seen wearing a silver chain, believed to be of sentimental value. They claim to be a farmer, although their exact location of residence is unknown. SCP-9572 is known for their laid-back and easy-going personality but is fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. Provoking SCP-9572's protective nature can lead to humorous yet potentially dangerous situations, including verbal altercations and physical confrontations.

SCP-9572 is cooperative and compliant with Foundation personnel, but their anomalous traits and lack of identification make it difficult to ascertain their true nature and purpose. Further investigation into SCP-9572's abilities and origins is ongoing.

Addendum:
SCP-9572's unique physical traits have prompted speculation that they are part of a previously undocumented anomalous humanoid species. Research into possible connections or interactions with other anomalous entities is ongoing.
