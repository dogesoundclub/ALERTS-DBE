SCP-1757 is a human male, employed in the occupation of firefighter. He possesses distinctive facial features including a visible mouth spot and a clown-like mouth with red eyes. The top of his head appears to be parted and pink, and he wears goggles on his forehead along with a jade earring and a gold chain.

Despite his unusual appearance, SCP-1757 is known for his caring and nurturing personality. He has been observed anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, such as giving his car a name and talking to his plants. It is believed that this behavior extends to household appliances as well.

Due to his unique features and behavior, SCP-1757 is to be monitored closely in all social interactions. Interrogators are advised to approach with caution, as SCP-1757's behavior may become erratic if he perceives mistreatment of the inanimate objects he is fond of. As with all SCPs, potential breaches of containment must be met with immediate response to prevent any damage to either SCP-1757 or those around him.
