Item #: SCP-1365

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1365 is to be monitored at all times through both video and audio surveillance. The entrance to SCP-1365's workplace must be blocked off at all times in order to prevent unauthorized access. SCP-1365 is to be prohibited from sharing any information regarding the Foundation or its operations with outsiders. Any attempts by SCP-1365 to do so must be immediately stopped.

Description: SCP-1365 is a male human of average height and build, with dark hair and a tendency to dress in casual clothing. SCP-1365's most distinctive features are its eyes, which are covered by ski goggles at all times, and its head, which is adorned by a purple cap with a headset. A secondary goggle is located on SCP-1365's forehead. SCP-1365 often wears a gold earring on one ear and a red scarf around its neck. SCP-1365 is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1365 works as a reporter and appears to have some degree of notoriety in its field. Its introspective nature can lead to moments of absent-mindedness, often resulting in accidents. There is no indication that SCP-1365 possesses any anomalous abilities, but its position as a reporter and access to potentially sensitive information pose a potential threat to the Foundation.

Personality: SCP-1365's introspective nature makes it prone to losing focus on its surroundings. Despite this, SCP-1365 possesses an analytical mind and is able to quickly and accurately interpret information. SCP-1365 has expressed interest in the supernatural and unexplained, often pursuing leads that may lead it to otherwise concealed information. SCP-1365 has not displayed any overt hostility towards the Foundation or its personnel, but its potential as a security risk must be taken into account.

Addendum: As of ██/██/████, SCP-1365 has expressed a desire to collaborate with the Foundation in exchange for access to information on anomalous phenomena. This proposal is currently under review by O5 Command.
