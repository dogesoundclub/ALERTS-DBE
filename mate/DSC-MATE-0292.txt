SCP-292 is a Fast Food Worker of the Human species, identified by their peculiar physical features. The subject's eyes resemble Ski Goggles, while their head is adorned with a Police Cap. Jade Earrings are seen dangling from the sides of the subject's ears, while a Medical Mask covers their mouth. A Gold Chain serves as the subject's primary accessory.

Behold the rebellious nature of SCP-292! Evidently, the subject possesses an unbreakable sense of independence and a natural resistance towards any form of authority or regulation that they deem unnecessary. As expected, this predisposition often leads to erratic behavior such as leaving work early or taking a day off without appropriate permission.

Given the odd appearance and tendencies of SCP-292, it is strongly advised to keep a close eye on them. All interactions with the subject must be conducted with the utmost caution and discretion. Anyone breaching the above protocols will result in immediate disciplinary action.
