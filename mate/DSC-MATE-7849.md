Description: Subject 7849 is a human male with a seemingly friendly demeanor. It works as a veterinarian and is well respected in the community. Subject 7849 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a red medical mask, and a red scarf around his neck. Its most distinctive feature is its eyes, which are naturally red and clown-like in appearance. However, it is unclear if these are an anomaly or a result of cosmetic lenses or contacts.

Subject 7849 has a tendency to act impulsively and engage in risky behavior without thought of consequence. This behavior has led to some humorous situations, such as jumping off a cliff into a river or taking unusual pets into its clinic. Despite its seemingly carefree behavior, subject 7849 is a professional in its work and has not shown any hostility towards others.

It is unknown if subject 7849 is an anomaly in its own right. Further research and observation are required to fully understand the nature of its behavior and traits. The Foundation is advised to monitor for any changes in its behavior or anomalies.
