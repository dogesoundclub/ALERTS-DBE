Item #: 1247

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of its job, 1247 is allowed to roam freely within the city's traffic. However, it should be monitored periodically for any abnormal behavior. Under no circumstances should any non-designated personnel engage in conversation with 1247 without prior approval from the Foundation.

Description: 1247 is a male monkey of an unknown species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. Its most notable feature is an expression of a perpetually frightened mouth despite showing no signs of fear or anxiety. 1247's eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology that enhances its night vision and situational awareness. Its head is adorned with a green Mohawk and a single Jade earring on its left ear. 1247 also wears a thin silver chain around its neck.

Personality: 1247 possesses exceptional charisma, making it easy to connect with other entities on a deeper level. It has an innate ability to draw confessions and anecdotes from strangers that create proximity and familiarity. Nevertheless, vital information should never be disclosed to 1247 as it has been suspected of having ties with organized crime syndicates.

Note: 1247 was recruited by the Foundation amidst reports of unusual traffic accidents traced back to its interactions with drivers and pedestrians. Further investigation revealed that its ability to create intimate bonds with people was being exploited to commit petty crimes. 1247 shows no sign of hostility to Foundation personnel and has proven to be cooperative with procedures, though mischievous tendencies can still be observed.
