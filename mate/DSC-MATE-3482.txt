SCP-3482, codenamed "The Gas Mask Villain", is a human female in her mid-30s. She sports orange stripes on her face, and her retro cap is adorned with a choker. However, her most notable feature is the LED gas mask she wears at all times. 

Our research has revealed that SCP-3482 has a strong and decisive personality. Her imposing demeanor can be intimidating to some, but it is all due to her need for efficient and effective work ethics. The Gas Mask Villain seems to have a preference for causing chaos in heavily populated areas. 

It is rumoured that SCP-3482 has connections with several underground gangs, which supply her with the necessary equipment for her criminal activities. Despite her relatively high profile, information regarding her true identity and origins remain non-existent. 

Unfortunately, our attempts to apprehend SCP-3482 have been unsuccessful so far, and all known operatives who were deployed to capture her have either turned up missing, dead, or severely injured. Until further notice, we advise exercising extreme caution when dealing with the Gas Mask Villain.
