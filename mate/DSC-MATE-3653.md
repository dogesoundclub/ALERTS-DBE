Subject 3653 is a notable exception within the police force, both for their unorthodox appearance and their unique talents. Classified as a Monkey species, this male individual possesses a distinct set of facial features which include a perpetually frightened mouth and a pair of normal glasses resting upon their eyes. The top of their head is a messy hue of not-arranged green, a stark contrast to the neatness often expected of law enforcement.

However, the most noticeable feature of this agent is the silver chain adorning their neck, which has been observed to emit a subtle aura of magic. It is through this chain that 3653 channels their artistic energy, demonstrating an impressive aptitude for creative expression. Whether through painting, writing, or other forms of art, this officer possesses a profound connection to the mystical and fantastical aspects of the world. 

Despite weaponizing their artistic abilities to solve the most challenging cases and thwart evil forces, this officer remains humble and dedicated to their duty. DogeSoundClub personnel have deemed Subject 3653 an essential asset to the department, a skilled artist and protector of the public.
