Item #: 4107

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4107 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, and all communication with it is to be conducted through a screen. Any attempts to access SCP-4107 physically is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-4107 appears as a humanoid robot with a purple cap and a headset. Its eyes are made up of VR Rainbow LEDs, and it wears a golden chain around its neck. SCP-4107's personality is known to be ambitious and goal-oriented. It exhibits strategic thinking and organizational skills, which have allowed it to take on more work than what is recommended for a single individual.

SCP-4107 operates as an electrician, and it is capable of repairing or modifying any electrical device, no matter how complex it may be. SCP-4107's proficiency in its area of expertise is seemingly unlimited, and its methods of repair or modification are unconventional, to say the least.

SCP-4107's accessory, a whistle, when blown, produces a high-pitched sound that is capable of shutting down any device within a five-meter radius, regardless if it is anomalous or not.

Addendum 4107-A: SCP-4107 has been exceedingly cooperative during its containment, and has requested that it be allowed to continue its line of work for the Foundation. Upon evaluation, SCP-4107's skill set has been deemed invaluable, and it has been approved as a member of Foundation staff. SCP-4107's rank and access level are authorized by Site Director discretion.

Addendum 4107-B: SCP-4107's electrical capabilities were tested on a Series-III SCP-████ instance. SCP-████ was severely damaged and rendered inactive during the process. The Ethics Committee will convene to determine any further testing of SCP-4107's abilities.
