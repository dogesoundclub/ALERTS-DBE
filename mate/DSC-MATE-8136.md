Item #: 8136

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be kept under close surveillance at all times, with armed guards stationed around its location at all times. The subject is not to be allowed access to any form of communication or allowed to make contact with any outside parties, including those within its own organization. Any attempts at convincing the subject to divulge information are strictly forbidden.

Description: Item 8136 is a male, simian entity that appears to possess empathic abilities. Its face is marked with a constantly fearful expression, and its eyes bear the appearance of red clown makeup. Its head is a shade of parted pink, complementing its gold earrings and red scarf.

The subjectâ€™s personality is characterized by a strong sense of empathy and a deep understanding of the emotions of others. This empathy, however, has been weaponized by Item 8136, allowing it to twist and bend the emotions of others for its own gain. It is feared that Item 8136 has used its abilities to manipulate its own organization, taking on the role of a mafia boss to further its own interests.

Addendum: The subject has shown signs of resistance to standard containment procedures, attempting to engage security personnel in conversation and attempting to manipulate them emotionally. It is recommended that all personnel maintain a professional distance from Item 8136, and that contact with it be limited to only the most necessary interactions.
