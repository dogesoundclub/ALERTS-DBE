As for accessories, SCP-3474 wears a silver chain around their neck and an LED gas mask, which is presumed to be for recreational purposes only. 

One aspect of the subject's personality that stands out is their acute attention to detail, bordering on obsession. SCP-3474 has been known to alphabetize and color-code personal items, raising concern among Foundation staff regarding possible compulsive behavior patterns. 

The subject has exhibited no anomalous abilities or behaviors, but their compulsion for order presents a potential threat to the secrecy of the Foundation's operations. A psych evaluation is recommended to monitor and address SCP-3474's condition.
