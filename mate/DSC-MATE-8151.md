Item #: 8151

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8151 is to be contained in a maximum-security facility at all times. Access to said facility is limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and every entrance must be guarded by armed security personnel. Any attempt at escape or breach must be met with lethal force.

Description: 8151 is a human female who goes by the name of "Mama". She is the foremost leader of a powerful mafia syndicate, with connections to several high-profile criminal organizations across the globe. Despite her ruthless reputation, her physical appearance may suggest otherwise. Notably, her head is adorned with a unique cap that has green hair, and is accompanied by an unusual pair of blue clown eyes. Additionally, she always wears a medical mask over her mouth piece.

Personality: Mama has a reputation for being a loving figure in contrast with other mafia bosses of similar stature. Despite engaging in illegal activities, she tends to be caring and nurturing to those closest to her, and has been known to go to great lengths to protect her followers with a fierce determination. This can result in humorous situations where she takes advice like taking care of their friends or family members as if they were her own children.

Although Mama's true motivations are unclear, many speculate that her background as a former nurse may have influenced her personality and leadership style. It is suggested to approach Mama with caution, as she is known to have an unpredictable side and can turn lethal when provoked.

DogeSoundClub Note: Mama is to be considered a significant threat to the safety and security of the Foundation and should be treated as such. Any attempts to study or interrogate her should be carried out with extreme caution.
