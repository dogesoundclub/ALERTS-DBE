Description: SCP-426 is a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye and a doge hat on its head. It is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette. Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-426 possesses a unique personality that can be both reliable and organized, while also stubborn and resistant to changes in routine.

SCP-426's primary occupation is that of a lawyer, although its legal practices often contain anomalies that require the intervention of Foundation personnel. SCP-426's abilities as a legal mind have been incredibly useful in preventing impacts to the Foundation's normalcy.

Despite its mechanical origins, SCP-426 seems to possess a keen sense of humor and an appreciation for irony, even in situations that could be considered hazardous. Personnel have observed SCP-426 making light of otherwise stressful situations, suggesting it may be using humor as a coping mechanism.

SCP-426 has demonstrated a clear preference for routine and structure, which can lead to frustration and difficulties when forced to face unexpected situations. Its stubbornness in this regard has led to humorous moments, such as when SCP-426 refused to speak to one of our researchers because they had changed their hairstyle.

It is recommended that personnel remain patient and accommodating when interacting with SCP-426, as it can become uncooperative if faced with unexpected changes. Nevertheless, SCP-426 is a valuable asset to the Foundation and must be treated with the utmost respect and care.
