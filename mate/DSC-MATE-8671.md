Item #: 8671

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8671 is to be monitored on a weekly basis to ensure their actions do not endanger the veil between the mundane and the supernatural. They are not to be allowed any access to high-risk items without proper clearance from a Level 3 researcher or above.

Description: Subject 8671 is a human female of average height and weight. They have distinguishable orange stripes on their face, which they often use to accentuate their features. Their eyes are concealed behind normal glasses, and their head is often adorned with a bucket hat.

Subject 8671's defining feature is a single jade earring on their left ear. Although seemingly ordinary, it is believed to be imbued with some mystical properties due to its odd behavior around certain magical items.

Subject 8671's personality is strong and decisive, which can intimidate some of their coworkers. However, this behavior is rooted in their desire to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in all aspects of their life, including their work as a car salesman.

Addendum: After a recent incident involving the attempted theft of a rare occult artifact, Subject 8671's efficiency and decisiveness have been vital in maintaining the veil between the mundane and magical. They have proven willing and able to take the necessary steps to protect the secrecy of supernatural beings and objects, which has earned them a commendation from the Foundation. Future assignments to high-priority containment procedures are under consideration.
