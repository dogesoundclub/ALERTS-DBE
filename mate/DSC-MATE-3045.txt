Description: SCP-3045 is a male police officer with orange stripes on their face and blue clown eyes. SCP-3045's hair is in a peak spike and they wear a green cross earring, a gold chain, and often hold a cigarette. SCP-3045's personality is unique in that they have an unusually strong sense of intuition. They seem to have the ability to predict future events and sense the emotions of those around them, although they deny any kind of psychic ability.

SCP-3045 has shown distrust towards the Foundation and any attempts at questioning their ability or containing it is met with resistance. It is believed that SCP-3045 is unaware of their anomalous ability and believes that it is simply a part of their personality. SCP-3045 is well-liked by the community and has a good reputation as a police officer.

SCP-3045's intuition has proven to be both helpful and a potential danger. On one occasion, SCP-3045 was able to sense a hostage situation before it occurred and prevent casualties. However, there have been instances where SCP-3045's intuition has caused them to act prematurely, potentially damaging an investigation or creating unnecessary panic.

Further testing and observation is needed to better understand SCP-3045's abilities and potential danger. Until then, SCP-3045 remains under close surveillance.
