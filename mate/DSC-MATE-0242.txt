Designation: SCP-242

Security Clearance: Level 4

Containment Procedures: SCP-242 is to be contained within a humanoid containment cell at Site-19. No other electronic device is to be in the presence of SCP-242 without explicit approval from two Level 4 personnel. SCP-242 is permitted to design clothing for Foundation personnel under supervision, as to prevent any anomalous properties from being introduced. Interaction with SCP-242 is approved upon recommendation from two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-242 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. SCP-242's body is primarily made up of metallic and synthetic components, with a synthetic 'skin' layer covering its surface. The most distinctive feature of SCP-242 is its single green cyclops eye affixed to its face, as well as the horned rim glasses over its eyes.

SCP-242's head is covered in green hair in a purple cap, and it has a single jade earring in one of its ears. SCP-242 is often seen wearing a red scarf, which it has expressed is a cherished item due to its color.

SCP-242's anomalous properties manifest in its ability to design clothing that possesses anomalous properties; this is not an intentional manifestation, but instead due to an innate anomalous nature. SCP-242 often tests the limits of Foundation guidelines, attempting to push them in order to create more daring clothing designs.

SCP-242's personality is known to be rebellious, often seen breaking rules or seeking out ways to bend them to its advantage. SCP-242 has a tendency for humorous situations and enjoys observing the outcomes of its actions.

SCP-242 was recovered from a fashion design firm in ████████, which was found to be creating anomalous clothing that was causing significant harm to consumers. SCP-242 was identified as the designer behind these items and was apprehended by Foundation agents for containment. Following containment, a full background check was conducted on SCP-242, but no records of its existence were found prior to recovery. 

Addendum: SCP-242 has been approved to design special outfits for undercover operations, allowing for operatives to blend in with civilian populations more effectively. However, SCP-242's designs must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel before production. Any unapproved designs are to be confiscated and destroyed immediately.
