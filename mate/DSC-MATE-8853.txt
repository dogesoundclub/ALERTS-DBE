Item #: 8853

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8853 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to her status as a high-ranking politician, SCP-8853 is to be monitored at all times and must not receive any visitors without prior approval from Level 4 personnel. Any attempt at escape or unauthorized communication must be met with complete apprehension and immediate interrogation.

Description: SCP-8853 is a female human with distinctive physical features. She has red clown eyes, 90s brown hair, a pair of goggles resting on her forehead, and wears gold earrings, silver chains, and a cigarette. Her most notable feature is her purple lip.

SCP-8853's personality is characterized by an overwhelming sense of nurturing care. This extends to inanimate objects as well, leading her to anthropomorphize them. SCP-8853 has been observed giving her car a name, conversing with her plants, and treating household appliances as if they have their personalities. This behavior has led SCP-8853 to believe that these objects possess a level of consciousness.

Further research has shown that SCP-8853's nurturing behavior originates from the manifestation of an anomalous entity. SCP-8853's presence has a powerful effect on any living organism, causing them to undergo rapid and uncontrolled growth. This effect is most profound in plants and trees, which can grow ten times faster than usual in SCP-8853's vicinity. SCP-8853 has also shown a remarkable ability to heal living organisms, with injuries, diseases, and illnesses disappearing entirely under her touch.

As a politician, SCP-8853 has used her anomalous abilities to sway public opinion and solidify her political power. The Foundation is currently working to prevent SCP-8853 from using her abilities for personal gain and protect civilians from the unintended consequences of her nurturing behavior.
