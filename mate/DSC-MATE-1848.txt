Item #: SCP-1848

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1848 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled containment chamber measuring no less than 15x15x10 meters. The room must contain several large perches and scratching posts. SCP-1848 is to be fed a diet of raw meat and whole prey items. All interaction with SCP-1848 must be approved by no less than two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1848 is a male Bengal tiger standing approximately 2.5 meters long and weighing 200 kg. SCP-1848 has been observed wearing a blue bandana around its head and a red cross earring in its ear. SCP-1848 will also wear a medical mask over its mouth when interacting with humans.

SCP-1848 exhibits an unusual level of intelligence and observation, beyond what is typical for tigers. It demonstrates a keen attention to detail and may spend significant amounts of time and effort selecting gifts for others. This behavior can become obsessive, with SCP-1848 becoming fixated on finding the "perfect" gift.

SCP-1848 is capable of understanding and responding to human speech, although it communicates primarily through body language and vocalizations. SCP-1848 has displayed a friendly and cooperative demeanor when interacting with Foundation personnel, but caution should be exercised due to its natural predatory instincts.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-1848 assisted in the successful surgical repair of a Foundation researcher's herniated disc. Despite having no formal medical training, SCP-1848 demonstrated a remarkable degree of surgical skill and knowledge. Following this incident, SCP-1848 has been granted permission to act as an advisory consultant to Foundation medical teams.
