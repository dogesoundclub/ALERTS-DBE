Item #: 9111

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of 9111's position as a Mafia boss, traditional containment methods are impossible. However, Foundation agents are to monitor 9111's activities and intervene if necessary to prevent any serious breaches of the masquerade.

Description: 9111 is a Caucasian male approximately 45 years of age. He wears normal glasses and a police cap, which serves as a nod to his former life as a police officer. However, his currently occupation as a Mafia boss is evident by the gold chain and gold earring he wears. His appearance belies the danger he poses to both mundane and supernatural society.

Personality: 9111 possesses a strong sense of independence and is often unwilling to ask for help, even when he needs it. This stubbornness can lead to humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy objects by himself or refusing to use a map when lost. However, his independent streak also makes him exceedingly difficult to manipulate or control, a trait which has earned him respect among both his allies and enemies.

Despite his generally aloof attitude, those close to 9111 report that he is incredibly loyal and fiercely protective of those under his care. His ruthless reputation as a Mafia boss belies a softer side, and it is rumored that he takes great pains to ensure that those who cross him are dealt with as humanely as possible.

Note: As 9111's primary concern is the continued operation of his criminal empire, he is considered a high-priority target for recruitment by GOI-004 "MC&D." Under no circumstances should 9111 be allowed to fall into the hands of this group.
