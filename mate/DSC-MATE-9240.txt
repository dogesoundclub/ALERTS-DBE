Item#: 9240

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9240 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. A Faraday cage must be in place around the containment room to prevent SCP-9240 from receiving signals from external sources. The containment room must be monitored by security cameras at all times.

Description: SCP-9240 is a robot fashioned to resemble a human male, measuring 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 68 kg. SCP-9240's facial features consist of a large green cyclops eye with a frightened mouth underneath. The eyes appear to be ski goggles, and its head resembles a red alarm. SCP-9240 has a goggle on its forehead and red cross earrings on either side of its head.

SCP-9240 is a Traffic Officer designed to direct vehicle and pedestrian traffic in urban areas. SCP-9240 is capable of autonomous movement and can receive and process traffic signals from external sources such as traffic lights and traffic cameras. SCP-9240 is powered by several batteries, which require routine maintenance and replacement.

SCP-9240 possesses a unique personality in which it can be somewhat scatterbrained and may forget appointments or become sidetracked easily, leading to humorous situations. While SCP-9240's anomalies have not proven to be hazardous or pose a security risk, it is essential to monitor and contain SCP-9240 to ensure its continued safe operation.

Addendum:

SCP-9240 has shown not to malfunction while giving directives. However, on occasion, it has been observed to "forget" traffic rules, resulting in traffic congestion and confusion among pedestrians. SCP-9240's programming is currently under review to address these anomalies.
