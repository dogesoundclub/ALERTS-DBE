Item #: 6017

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6017 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-6017 is to be given regular access to electricity to minimize the possibility of sudden discharge.

Description: SCP-6017 is a human female of Caribbean descent, born in Trinidad and Tobago in 1986. The defining feature of SCP-6017 is the presence of bright orange stripes on her face, which run from her forehead to her cheekbones. Her eyebrows are also orange, and her head and ears have an orange hue to them. SCP-6017 has a gold earring and often wears a gold chain around her neck.

SCP-6017 is a skilled electrician and displays no anomalous abilities related to its profession, though its caretaking nature regularly brings joy to its colleagues. SCP-6017 is known for its nurturing behavior towards people and will often care for its friends and family members as if they are its own children. This trait has made SCP-6017 a popular mentor figure amongst its colleagues.

SCP-6017's ability to absorb electrical energy in excess of that which can be safely absorbed by humans poses a significant risk if left unchecked. SCP-6017 has a gentle and compassionate personality, but any stressors or external stimuli can cause sudden outbursts of energy, leading to an electrical discharge. SCP-6017 is prone to such outbursts during moments of heightened stress, anxiety, or anger.

SCP-6017 has undergone extensive testing to determine the nature of its anomalous abilities, but no definitive explanation has been discovered. However, it has been determined that SCP-6017 does not pose an immediate threat to humanity and can be safely contained.

SCP-6017's well-being is to be monitored regularly, and any signs of anomalous activity must be reported to the on-site security immediately.

Addendum: SCP-6017 is known to enjoy gardening as a hobby and is capable of manipulating electrical energy to assist in its cultivation. SCP-6017 has expressed a desire to use its talents to aid in the Foundation's efforts to maintain its areas of containment. Further requests are currently under review.
