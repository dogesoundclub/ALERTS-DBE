SCP-5323 is a feared Mafia Boss who operates with extreme efficiency and deadly precision. He is a human, but his appearance is far from ordinary. His frightening mouth is always twisted in a permanent expression of terror, as if he knows something that no one else does. His eyes, on the other hand, are mesmerizing blue clown eyes that have an unnerving effect on anyone who stares too long.

Even his chosen attire is mysterious and unsettling, always hiding his true intentions. He wears a hoodie to hide his face and a medical mask to conceal his mouth, as if he is aware of the potentially dangerous consequences of letting anyone see his true emotions. His gold chain is one of the only indicators of his status and wealth, often serving as a symbol of his power and control.

Despite his terrifying presence, SCP-5323 has an unexpected side. He values harmony and social connections above all else and has a charming and charismatic side that can catch people off guard. His playful nature often leads to humorous situations, as he enjoys telling jokes and engaging in playful banter with others. But make no mistake, SCP-5323 is still a powerful and dangerous force who will stop at nothing to protect his interests and those he cares about. Approach with caution.
