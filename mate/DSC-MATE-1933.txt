Item #: 1933

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 1933 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to 1933 is to be granted only with Level 2 clearance or higher. As a precautionary measure, all those wishing to interact with 1933 must wear safety gloves and face masks.

Description: 1933 appears to be a male monkey with a parted pink head, horned-rimmed glasses for eyes, and a frightened mouth. The forehead features two color bands, and it wears a silver chain around its neck, and a normal gas mask as an accessory.

1933 exhibits a highly empathetic and compassionate personality, often taking on other people's problems as their own. This causes 1933 to develop a sense of responsibility for fixing everything and everyone around them. This can be an admirable trait but can become exhausting when confronted with the suffering of others. 1933 has been observed to try to mitigate the distress of other SCPs and personnel, risking its own safety in the process.

Addendum: 1933 was initially identified as a journalist reporting on SCP activities, and it has proven valuable in gathering intelligence on the activities within the facility. Its compassionate nature and ability to connect with SCPs has proved useful in keeping order and peace within the facility. Despite its cooperation, caution is advised when interacting with 1933, as its empathic nature may be used against the containment effort if mishandled.
