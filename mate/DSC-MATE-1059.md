Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1059 has been detained within Site-██'s humanoid containment wing. Due to the subject's high-profile status as a mafia boss, it is imperative that all personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-1059 demonstrate respect and caution when interacting with the subject. All personnel are required to wear appropriate protective gear during all interactions with the subject.

Description: DSC-MATE-1059 is a female human of indeterminate age, with a distinctive smile that reflects unnaturally large and red clown eyes. The subject wears a hoodie and a choker as a statement of her status as a mafia boss. Despite her seemingly human appearance, DSC-MATE-1059 has demonstrated a proclivity towards detail-oriented behavior.

The subject's obsession with precision and orderliness can manifest in unexpected ways, ranging from alphabetizing her spice rack to color-coding her closet. DSC-MATE-1059's unwavering attention to detail may denote a potential heightened level of danger or unpredictability in the subject's behavior.

DSC-MATE-1059 displays a sharp wit and cunning intelligence that could prove useful to Foundation operations. However, due to the subject's holding of significant power within the criminal underworld, any cooperative efforts between DSC-MATE-1059 and the Foundation must be carefully monitored and managed.

Addendum 1059-1: During an interrogation, DSC-MATE-1059 exhibited an awareness of paranormal entities and knowledge of the Foundation's existence. It is unclear how DSC-MATE-1059 acquired this information, but has stated that she is willing to cooperate with the Foundation in exchange for a reduced sentence.

Addendum 1059-2: Following the acceptance of the subject's offer for cooperation, DSC-MATE-1059 provided information on several criminal organizations and their associated anomalies, leading to the apprehension and containment of several previously unknown DSC objects.

Note: While DSC-MATE-1059 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, it must be noted that any future interaction with the subject must be handled with the utmost care and caution, as her allegiances and loyalties may be fluid and mercurial.
