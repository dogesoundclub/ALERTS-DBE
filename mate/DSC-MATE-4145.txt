Item #: SCP-4145

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4145 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to the nature of her abilities, the cell must be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure no potential escape routes exist. All requests for tool access must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel and all tools used by the subject must be returned and inspected before being passed onto another individual. 

Description: SCP-4145 is a human female, identifying as a Mechanic by profession. SCP-4145 stands at 1.72 meters tall and weighs around 55 kg. SCP-4145's most notable feature is the spots on their face, believed to be a genetic abnormality. SCP-4145's eyes are replaced with virtual reality LED's arranged in a rainbow color pattern that seem to emit holographic projections. SCP-4145's hair is fair and wavy, extending down to her thighs. She has an anomalous wing suspended from her head, capable of locomotion without SCP-4145's control.

SCP-4145 is equipped with goggles on their forehead and a red cross earring on their left ear. They wear a gas mask equipped with a series of filters that allow SCP-4145 to work in toxic environments with ease. SCP-4145 is seen wearing a choker chain, which is believed to be a gift from a former significant other.

SCP-4145 is incredibly observant and attentive to details. This allows her to improvise and adapt to mechanical challenges quickly. However, it is noted that SCP-4145's attention to detail can become obsessive, causing her to overanalyze situations and struggle with making decisions. Due to this trait, SCP-4145 is cautious and hesitant when giving gifts, as she wants them to be perfect, often agonizing over her selection.

Addendum: After a request was approved, SCP-4145 was interviewed briefly by Dr. Johansen: 

Dr. Johansen: Can you explain your ability to move your wing?

SCP-4145: It's always been there. I was born with it, and I can control it. I was too scared to tell anyone about it until [REDACTED]

Dr. Johansen: It's magnetic, right?

SCP-4145: You shouldn't say that too loudly. 

Dr. Johansen: Why not?

SCP-4145: [SCP-4145 proceeds to unscrew the screws in the table from their seat and puts the table next to her bed] 

Dr. Johansen: Alright, noted.
