Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3776 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to their profession as a beautician, DSC-MATE-3776 is allowed a small set of grooming tools as long as they do not pose a security risk. Any attempts to remove DSC-MATE-3776 from containment must be approved by Level 3 personnel and accompanied by at least two armed guards.

Description: DSC-MATE-3776 appears to be a male rabbit with VR rainbow LED eyes and a police cap on their head. A goggle is also present on their forehead, and they wear a silver chain as an accessory. Despite their small stature, they possess an unnaturally sharp wit and a love for debate. DSC-MATE-3776's playful arguments and quick comebacks have been known to liven up an otherwise mundane day in containment.

DSC-MATE-3776 was originally discovered working as a beautician at a salon in the heart of the city. Their strange appearance and wittiness made them popular among the local clientele, but also drew the attention of the Foundation. After some investigation, DSC-MATE-3776 was deemed a potential security risk and was subsequently captured and contained.

DSC-MATE-3776's anomalous properties have yet to be fully understood, but it is believed that their quick wit may be tied to their secondary anomalous effect. DSC-MATE-3776 has been known to use their charming personality to influence and manipulate others, often to their own advantage. As such, all interactions with DSC-MATE-3776 must be monitored closely to prevent any potential breaches of security.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3776 has requested that they be allowed to continue practicing their trade as a beautician while in containment. After much debate, this request has been approved under the condition that all tools used by DSC-MATE-3776 are monitored and accounted for at all times. DSC-MATE-3776 has proven to be cooperative with these conditions and has provided several services to Foundation personnel with no reported incidents.
