Item #: 7763

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Object 7763, also known as "the Lawyer", must be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with security cameras and reinforced walls. Due to its charming and charismatic nature, all personnel assigned to its containment must undergo psychological evaluations and background checks to prevent emotional manipulation or bribery.

Description: Object 7763 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, measuring approximately 1.5 meters in height when standing upright. The rabbit has a sleek, well-groomed coat of brown fur that covers its body, and ski goggles that serve as its eyes. On its head, Object 7763 wears a headset equipped with LED lights that illuminate in various colors depending on its mood.

The Lawyer, as it is commonly called, possesses a natural charm and charisma that can be incredibly influential. Its magnetic personality often draws others towards it, and it is known for its ability to turn the tide of any conversation or negotiation in its favor. It has been observed to use this charming persona to manipulate those around it into doing what it desires, and as such, it has been deemed a potential threat to public safety.

Furthermore, the Lawyer's jovial nature often results in it behaving in a childlike manner, telling jokes, pulling pranks, and doing silly dances to entertain those around it. While this behavior can be endearing to some, it has been known to distract others from the realities of the situation at hand. 

Due to its manipulative and often unpredictable behavior, all personnel are advised to maintain a professional distance from the Lawyer and to never let their guard down while in its presence.

Addendum: Object 7763 was recovered from an unknown location after being found practicing law without a license. It has since been formally disbarred and placed under the jurisdiction of the SCP foundation.
