Item #: SCP-5311

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5311 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber situated within a 5-meter electrified fence to prevent unauthorized access. Access to the subject is allowed with the approval of at least a Level 3 personnel, under the surveillance of security personnel.

Description: SCP-5311 is a male tiger humanoid measuring 1.8 meters tall. The subject works as a real estate agent and dresses in a suit and tie. SCP-5311 expresses human-like intelligence and characteristics, including the ability to communicate in English fluently. SCP-5311's notable features include a gold earring on its left ear, horned rim glasses, and two black bands on its forehead. The subject also wears a candy stick and goggles on its forehead, used for unknown purposes.

SCP-5311 is known for its exceptional observational skills and attention to detail, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, the subject may spend an excessive amount of time choosing the "perfect" gift, sometimes even to the point of obsession. SCP-5311's gift-giving tendencies are believed to stem from its desire to build close relationships with others.

Addendum 5311-1: During a routine interview with SCP-5311, the subject expressed dissatisfaction with its containment protocols, claiming that they were hindering its real estate career. SCP-5311 requested a transfer to a safer containment facility with access to the outside world.

After review by Site Director █████, SCP-5311 was granted a transfer to a more extensive containment facility. SCP-5311 continues to work as a real estate agent for the Foundation, providing valuable services to Foundation personnel in need of assistance.

Addendum 5311-2: Research on the origin of SCP-5311 is ongoing. However, initial investigations suggest that it is the result of an anomalous manifestation, with no known link to any existing groups or anomalies. Additional research is necessary to determine the source of SCP-5311's anomalous properties.
