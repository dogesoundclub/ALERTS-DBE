Item #: SCP-1891

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1891 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their occupation, SCP-1891 is permitted to exit containment to respond to calls as a firefighter. SCP-1891 is to be accompanied by at least one armed Foundation agent at all times during these excursions.

Description: SCP-1891 is a female human with a distinctive spotted face and a constant smile. Their eyes are a bright shade of blue and are noted to resemble clown eyes. SCP-1891's head and clothing exhibit a rainbow festival aesthetic. They often wear a red cross earring and a silver chain. SCP-1891 is frequently observed smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1891 has a dry sense of humor that often takes people by surprise. They have a talent for delivering deadpan jokes that can be unexpectedly funny. SCP-1891 has been noted to be highly determined and persistent in pursuing their goals, both in firefighting and in daily life.

SCP-1891's anomalous effects have yet to be fully understood, but it is believed that their humor and positivity have some kind of subtle effect on those around them. Test subjects exposed to SCP-1891 have reported feeling more optimistic and motivated. Further research into the extent of this effect is ongoing. 

SCP-1891 was initially discovered during a routine firefighting operation, during which they demonstrated an above-average resistance to injury and an exceptional ability to rapidly locate and rescue trapped individuals. After initial observation and testing, SCP-1891 was contained by the Foundation. 

Addendum: After several years in containment, SCP-1891 has been noted to express a desire for freedom and to return to their firefighting duties. While their anomalous effects are currently considered beneficial, special care must be taken to ensure SCP-1891's containment and prevent potential misuse of their abilities.
