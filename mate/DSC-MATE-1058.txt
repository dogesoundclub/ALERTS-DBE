SCP-1058 is a peculiar human with the superficial traits of a clown but a heart that shines with an empathetic and compassionate light. Her red lips are the only trait that suggests any trace of vanity, and they stand out masked under a white medical mask.

The most striking feature of SCP-1058 is her blue clown eyes, which are disturbingly large and seem to have no pupils. Their gleam is almost hypnotic and mesmerizing, but it is crucial to resist their allure, as several agents reported mild hallucinations after prolonged exposure.

SCP-1058's sensitivity to others' emotions can be a double-edged sword. Her urge to help everyone that crosses her path is noble, but it also puts her at risk of becoming emotionally drained and overwhelmed. We recommend avoiding exposing her to emotionally charged situations unless strictly necessary.

Her ears, adorned with green cross earrings, deceive anyone that makes light of her. SCP-1058 is sharp-witted and capable of detecting lies and hidden intentions, skills that make her a valuable asset in investigation and reporting.

SCP-1058 works as a reporter, tirelessly investigating the paranormal and the supernatural, hoping to shed light on subjects that the public should know about. Her curious nature and determination make her an excellent partner for any operation requiring investigative skills.

Despite SCP-1058's unusual appearance, we recommend treating her with the same respect and professionalism as any regular human. Her compassionate heart and sharp mind make her one of the most valuable assets we have available.
