SCP-4254, designated as "The Rabbit Programmer," is a humanoid creature of the Lagomorpha order. He stands at approximately 1.5 meters tall, with soft brown fur covering the entirety of his body. His facial feature is notable for having a frightened mouth that twitches anxiously when he's feeling uneasy. SCP-4254 has green hair styled away from his face while wearing a purple cap, accompanied by a gold earring dangling from his left ear. He is typically seen with a cigarette in his mouth, which he claims helps him focus when it comes to his work.

SCP-4254's personality leans towards traditionalism, and he has a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to his work. However, SCP-4254's playful side can often emerge, especially when he's telling jokes or amusing stories that have been passed down from his family or community. This can make for a lighthearted environment around SCP-4254, though one should not underestimate his technological skills. SCP-4254's programming abilities are the result of his uncanny ability to analyze complex problems and devise creative solutions.

Despite his small stature, SCP-4254 is an invaluable asset to the Foundation's research department. His ability to analyze and troubleshoot technological problems has assisted in the development of more advanced containment facilities, as well as the creation of programs to aid in the identification of anomalous occurrences. SCP-4254's work has been instrumental in reducing the possibility of breaches and keeping Foundation personnel safe.

As with all SCPs, specimens should be treated with care and respect. SCP-4254 has a friendly disposition, but any attempts at physical harm or distress may result in an adverse reaction. The Foundation will continue to study SCP-4254's unique abilities while providing the creature with the utmost care and support.
