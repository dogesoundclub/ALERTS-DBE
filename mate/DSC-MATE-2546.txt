Item #: SCP-2546

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2546 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The walls of this chamber must be made of reinforced steel with a single observation window for monitoring his behavior. SCP-2546 is to be provided with standard rabbit food and water. Any objects of emotional value, including the gold chain and candy stick, are to be confiscated.

Description: SCP-2546 is a male rabbit species with a frightened mouth expression located on its face when observed. When discovered, SCP-2546 was wearing a headset with LED lights, along with a gold chain and candy stick. Described as a car salesman, SCP-2546 was seen to possess the ability of speech and is capable of understanding human language. SCP-2546 usually tries to convince people into purchasing cars. His voice appears to be higher-pitched than most human men.

SCP-2546 displays a deep sense of empathy and understanding towards others. SCP-2546 has been seen to tear up or have emotional outbursts when witnessing someone's pain or suffering. He also appears to have an affinity for animals and nature.

Addendum 2546-A: SCP-2546's possession of objects while being contained was discovered after multiple incidents of SCP-2546 escaping containment and retrieving his gold chain and candy stick. The objects have been determined to be of sentimental value to SCP-2546 and were returned to him under the agreement that he remains within his containment chamber. SCP personnel must monitor these objects at all times.
