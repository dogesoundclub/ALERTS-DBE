Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3264 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to SCP-3264's occupation as a lawyer, it is allowed access to a personal computer, provided it is not connected to the Internet. All outgoing and incoming electronic communication is to be monitored by staff at all times. SCP-3264 is to be given a red scarf and a pack of cigarettes as part of its containment, and is permitted to smoke within its chamber.

Description: SCP-3264 is a middle-aged human male, standing at 1.85 meters tall and weighing approximately 72 kilograms. SCP-3264's most notable physical features include a spot on its mouth and a frightened expression, both of which are present at all times regardless of its emotional state. SCP-3264's eyes resemble those of a clown, with the pupils and irises appearing as red circles.

SCP-3264 is a risk-taker with a love for adventure, often engaging in activities such as bungee jumping and hiking in its free time. Despite its tendency to put itself in dangerous situations, SCP-3264 has not sustained any major injuries or harm. SCP-3264 is often lighthearted and humorous, and enjoys telling stories of its adventurous endeavors.

Addendum 3264-1: On ██/██/████, SCP-3264 was found to have accessed the internet using its personal computer. Staff discovered that SCP-3264 had been applying for multiple credit cards and making large purchases. Following this incident, SCP-3264's computer access was revoked and electronic communication monitoring increased. It is believed that SCP-3264's love for adventure may have contributed to its reckless spending behavior.
