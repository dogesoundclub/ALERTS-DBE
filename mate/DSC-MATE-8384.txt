He has a blue bandana on their forehead, under which sits a small pair of goggles. SCP-8384 also sports a single gold earring in their left ear. Despite the unusual appearance of SCP-8384, it remains friendly and somewhat docile.

SCP-8384 displays a clear set of personality traits that include a strong sense of responsibility and duty. On occasion, SCP-8384 may take on a larger workload than they can handle, leading to some comedic scenes where SCP-8384 is unable to perform their duties correctly. However, it is important to treat SCP-8384 with the respect and care they require, to ensure their continued comfort and ease of living.

Addendum: SCP-8384 was found in a local animal shelter after being abandoned by its previous owner. After exhibiting strange behavior, the animal shelter staff notified the Foundation, and SCP-8384 was relocated to its current containment. SCP-8384's unique features and unusual behavior has piqued the interest of researches, and further studies are underway to understand the cause of SCP-8384's bizarre appearance and behavior.
