Item #: SCP-8989

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8989 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, assigned with a task to work as a fast food worker in ██████. SCP-8989 must wear a hoodie and a medical mask at all times to limit exposure to the public. Eye contact with SCP-8989 should be avoided; however, if it is necessary to establish a conversation, personnel must maintain a safe distance and not make any sudden aggressive movements.

Description: SCP-8989 is a female human identified by her unique face features. She presents multiple spots randomly distributed on her face, a purple lip, and vibrant blue clown eyes. SCP-8989 wears a gold chain as an accessory, which does not seem to have any effect on her behavior. SCP-8989's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but at the same time, she enjoys having fun and being a clown.

SCP-8989 is exceptionally agile and moves with an unusual grace; she can twist, twirl, and dance effortlessly. SCP-8989 is also known for her silly antics, which have caused disturbances in the workplace; her coworkers have found her to be a source of amusement, and many of them have tried to mimic her.

SCP-8989 arrived at the Foundation's attention after local authorities reported strange activities occurring in the fast-food chain where she was employed. Several reports described a woman with mystical abilities capable of manipulating customers' emotions, causing them to behave erratically or become excessively aggressive. The Foundation Infiltration Unit quickly identified SCP-8989 as the culprit and detained her without incident.

SCP-8989's anomalous abilities are still under investigation, and some speculate that her clown-like features may have a connection to a rare and unknown supernatural genetic mutation. Further research is required.
