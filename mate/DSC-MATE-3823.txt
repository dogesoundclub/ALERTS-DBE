SCP-3823, also known as "The Psychic Primate," is a male monkey of unknown origin currently working as a programmer. SCP-3823's physical appearance is mostly unremarkable, except for a constant expression of fear present on its mouth. SCP-3823 regularly wears glasses, granting it normal vision. SCP-3823's most notable accessory is a candy stick, which it is often seen chewing on nervously.

SCP-3823 is a highly intuitive creature, with an uncanny ability to predict future events and sense emotion. The exact nature of these abilities is currently unknown, and researchers are actively investigating the source of SCP-3823's psychic powers. SCP-3823's abilities have been observed to manifest in a variety of ways, including predicting major events, sensing emotional distress in others, and even reading thoughts.

Despite its impressive abilities, SCP-3823's powers can be unsettling to those around it. SCP-3823's constant prediction of future events often leaves those around it feeling a sense of unease. Additionally, SCP-3823's ability to sense emotion can make it difficult for individuals to hide their true feelings and intentions. As such, SCP-3823 has been classified as Euclid-level, and researchers are advised to exercise caution when interacting with it.

In the interest of further understanding SCP-3823's abilities, researchers have been directed to study its behavior patterns closely. Any new developments in SCP-3823's psychic abilities are to be documented immediately and reported to Site Director ████████.
