Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 5762, also known as "The Empathic Electrician," is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to the subject's unique abilities, it is recommended that all interaction with them be limited to the usage of remote viewing devices or robotic avatars, as personal contact is known to cause unpredictable emotional responses. Any personnel assigned to interact with the subject must undergo mandatory psychological evaluations and monitoring.

Description: ID number 5762 is a human male with otherwise unremarkable physical features. The subject's most notable attribute is their vivid red clown eyes, which have been observed to shift in color based on their emotional state. Additionally, the subject commonly wears a medical mask and a short peak cap with a gold earring in one ear. 

The subject's abilities are a direct result of their overpowering sense of empathy. They possess an intuitive understanding of the emotions and feelings of others, to such an extent that they can often experience them as if they were their own. This ability is not limited by proximity or line of sight, as the subject has been observed exhibiting empathetic responses to individuals they have never met before.

Due to their empathic nature, the subject is deeply affected by the pain and suffering of others, often to the point of emotional outbursts or tears. They have a natural fondness for animals and nature, with a particular affinity for trees and plants. 

It is recommended that the subject be utilized for humanitarian efforts or other emotionally charged assignments, as their abilities can be a valuable asset in crisis situations.

Addendum: It is important to note that the subject's abilities are not without danger. The emotional overload caused by prolonged exposure to negative emotions can potentially cause permanent psychological damage, resulting in an unstable and unpredictable subject. As such, all experimentation with ID number 5762 must be conducted with extreme caution and under close supervision.
