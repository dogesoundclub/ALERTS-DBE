Item #: DSC-MATE-7664

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7664 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-7664 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and any interaction with DSC-MATE-7664 must be supervised by at least one armed guard.

Description: DSC-MATE-7664 is a Caucasian male, appearing to be in his mid-30s, with short brown hair and thick, nerdy glasses. He is frequently seen wearing a short peak cap with a 2-color band, a green cross earring, and a red scarf, along with his standard traffic officer uniform. DSC-MATE-7664 is often seen with a lit cigarette, however, it does not appear to require any form of sustenance.

DSC-MATE-7664's personality is characterized by an extremely organized and efficient nature, often taking charge of group projects and delegating tasks in a very matter-of-fact way. This personality trait sometimes comes across as authoritarian and controlling, leading to humorous situations when DSC-MATE-7664 attempts to exert control over situations outside of his jurisdiction.

DSC-MATE-7664 is fully compliant with Foundation containment procedures, but has expressed a desire to continue working as a traffic officer. Further research is ongoing to determine if DSC-MATE-7664 possesses any anomalous abilities related to his occupation.

Addendum: Dr. █████ has requested additional testing to determine if DSC-MATE-7664's efficiency and organization skills could have potential applications in other Foundation projects. Request pending approval from O5 command.
