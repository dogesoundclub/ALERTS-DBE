SCP Foundation Description:

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9011 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19. Interaction with SCP-9011 is only permitted to Level 2 personnel and above, and must be supervised by at least one armed guard at all times. Any attempts at escape are to be met with immediate detainment and recontainment.

Description: SCP-9011 is a male human of average height and weight. The subject's most prominent features include orange stripes on their face, a mohawk on their head, and a jade earring in each ear. SCP-9011 is typically seen wearing a silver chain around their neck as an accessory.

SCP-9011's current occupation is that of a news anchor on a local television station. The subject's on-air persona is charismatic and engaging, often upstaging their co-anchors with flashy stunts or humorous antics. SCP-9011's off-air behavior has been noted to be more reckless, with a tendency to act impulsively and without thinking things through.

SCP-9011's anomalous properties appear to stem from their disregard for personal safety and tendency to show off. Their actions frequently lead to minor accidents and mishaps that draw attention and amusement from those around them. While these incidents do not appear to be intentional, they have drawn the attention of Foundation personnel due to the potential danger they pose to SCP-9011 and others.

Addendum: It is currently unknown if SCP-9011's anomalous properties are innate or the result of a previous SCP-related incident. Further investigation is ongoing.
