Item #: SCP-5107

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5107 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. SCP-5107 is to be allowed limited access to the site's media library for her job as a news anchor, but all media released must first be approved by a Level 3 personnel for any potential anomalous implications.

SCP-5107's eye implants are to be inspected monthly for any signs of alteration or malfunction. Should any issues arise, the Foundation's cybernetic specialists are to be consulted immediately.

SCP-5107 is a human female of average height and build, with distinct spots on her face and a purple lip. Her head is adorned with a multicolored Rainbow Festival headpiece, and she wears a pair of Jade LED VR lenses over her eyes.

Additionally, SCP-5107 wears a pair of goggles on her forehead, a Jade earring in each ear, a silver chain necklace, and often carries a cigarette.

SCP-5107 possesses a highly analytical and logical personality, often engaging in debates or arguments for the sheer enjoyment of mental stimulation. She is known to become deeply focused when discussing a topic of interest and may appear emotionally detached in these situations.

It is noted that SCP-5107's Rainbow Festival headpiece sometimes appears to shift colors on its own, though testing has revealed no anomalous properties.

SCP-5107 came to the Foundation's attention after reports of her broadcasting unexplained events during her news broadcasts. Although no overtly supernatural evidence has been found, SCP-5107 has been noted as having an anomalous "presence" that has yet to be explained.

Due to her exposure to anomalous phenomena, SCP-5107 is to be monitored for any potential changes in her behavior or abilities. Any such changes must be reported immediately to the Site Director.
