SCP Foundation Identification Number 8247, also known as "The Banker," is a female humanoid with distinctive features. Her face is marked with spots scattered across her skin, drawing attention to her striking red lips. Her eyes appear to be a fiery orange, accentuated by a bold, arched eyebrow. On top of her head sits a delicate tiara, hinting at her regal nature. And, completing her unique look, she proudly wears a green cross earring on one ear.

Despite her remarkable appearance, The Banker's personality is uncomplicated. She can sometimes be absent-minded and forgetful, losing herself in deep thought or a focused project. Unfortunately, this tendency can lead to challenging situations, such as forgotten appointments or missed deadlines. Her mistakes often result in amusement, but they can also have serious implications in her line of work.

The Banker is an expert in her profession, tirelessly working for her clients to enhance their finances and better their lives. However, her tendency to lose track of time and deadlines can have negative ramifications, and she must remain vigilant to avoid disappointing those who depend on her.

As an enigmatic The Banker moves through her day, her unique features and quirks draw curious glances from all who pass her by. But behind her striking appearance lies a complex and fascinating individual, one whose life intertwines with the world of finance and the supernatural.
