Document #404: "The Caretaker"

Security Level: Class III Clearance Required

Description: Subject 404 is a human male standing at approximate height of 5'7'' with an average build. The subject's most striking feature is the brightly painted orange stripes on their face and a permanent, unnervingly wide smile. In addition, subject 404 is often seen wearing a worn-out doge hat and sporting a green cross earring on their left ear. They are officially employed as a beautician, mainly focusing on hair and makeup for their clients.

Personality: Analysis from past behavior patterns reveals that subject 404 possesses strong caregiver tendencies. They feel a deep sense of responsibility towards everything under their care, from pets to inanimate objects. The subject often names their belongings, talks to their plants, and expresses attachment to household appliances in a way that is beyond what the average human exhibits. This behavior is somewhat unusual but not harmful to others. It is noted, however, that subject 404's attachment to their clients can lead to certain ethical concerns regarding favoritism.

Conclusion: Overall, subject 404 poses no immediate threat to the public or other personnel in the facility. However, their peculiar attachment to personal belongings could lead to complications with other personnel, as subject 404 becomes quickly fixated on anything within the vicinity. Any object of their fixation should be monitored closely and transferred promptly to a safer location. Any attempts to harm or separate the subject from their personal belongings could result in a hostile response.
