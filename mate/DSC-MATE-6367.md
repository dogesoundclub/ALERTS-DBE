Item #: 6367

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6367 is allowed to carry out their duties as a traffic officer without disruption from Foundation personnel. Standard monitoring procedures are to be implemented to ensure no deviation in behavior.

Description: Subject 6367 is a human male traffic officer with significant adornments on his person. The subject's blue clown eyes are a result of CPD-C, a known genetic mutation caused by exposure to magical energies. The subject's bucket hat has been identified as a standard issue traffic hat with no abnormal properties. However, the red victory band displayed across the subject's forehead has been confirmed to possess minor electrical properties, which aid in the subject's ability to control traffic flow.

The subject's green cross earring has been identified as a sign of their affiliation with a local church. The medical mask worn by the subject is believed to be used to avoid inhaling any harmful airborne anomalies.

The subject's personality has been noted as overwhelmingly nurturing, leading to humorous situations where they treat friends and family members as if they were their own children. This behavior has not been identified as a security threat and is believed to be a result of past personal trauma.

Addendum: The subject's ability to control traffic flow has been discovered to involve the manipulation of reality-altering anomalies. Efforts to enlist the subject for Foundation purposes are ongoing.
