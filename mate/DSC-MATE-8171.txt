Description: SCP-8171 is a female human with orange stripes around the edges of her face, accompanied by purple lips and orange eyebrows. SCP-8171's forehead features a two-color band, and it is often seen wearing a medical mask over its mouth, which is assumed to be a response to air pollution. SCP-8171's head is covered with a hoodie that also features an orange stripe.

SCP-8171 is always seen wearing a silver chain, which serves no anomalous purpose. Although SCP-8171's appearance is unusual, its abilities are mostly benign and of negligible threat to Foundation personnel.

SCP-8171 has a remarkable attention to detail and is very observant. It can spend a lot of time contemplating the perfect gift for someone, often leading to overthinking and unnecessary stress.

Addendum: SCP-8171 has shown no resistance to Foundation containment procedures and is willing to cooperate with the Foundation in all matters. It has not shown any signs of anomalous ability, and is considered of negligible threat to the Foundation at this time.

SCP-8171's containment has been deemed safe and secure, and its continued surveillance will guarantee the safety of both the SCP and its surroundings.
