BIOS REVISION 3741

Item #: SCP-3741

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3741 is contained within Site-██ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Personnel are required to wear respirators when within 2 meters of SCP-3741 to prevent potential exposure to airborne pathogens. SCP-3741 is permitted to maintain their occupation as a mechanic, but with the stipulation that they are to consistently document and report any anomalous occurrences or objects they may encounter.

Description: SCP-3741 is a male Human of average height and weight, with numerous dark spots covering their face and body. These spots, while visually resembling moles or freckles, have not yet been identified as any known biological feature. SCP-3741 habitually wears a medical mask to conceal a persistent cough and to prevent the spread of potential infectious diseases, despite showing no signs of infection during medical examinations.

SCP-3741 displays personality traits characteristic of independence and stubbornness, often refusing assistance or resources even in situations where they would be considered necessary. This has resulted in numerous minor injuries and comical situations, as SCP-3741 insists on completing tasks or navigating through unfamiliar terrain without seeking aid.

Addendum: SCP-3741 has reported anomalous events related to their work as a mechanic, including tools or machinery behaving in unexpected or seemingly autonomous ways. Further investigation is ongoing, and SCP-3741 has been advised to remain vigilant in their work and to report any additional unusual occurrences.
