SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-7121

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7121 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Standard psychological assessments are to be conducted monthly. SCP-7121 is authorized to attend to its job as a news anchor, provided that it is escorted by armed guards.

Description: SCP-7121 is a human male with orange stripes on its face. Its mouth is perpetually in a frightened expression, and its eyes are augmented with VR rainbow LED. SCP-7121 often wears a red beanie, a gold earring, and a red scarf. It also carries a candy stick as an accessory.

SCP-7121 is highly observant and attentive to details. This trait can make it an excellent gift-giver. However, SCP-7121 may become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-7121's anomalous properties manifest when it is live on TV, where its observational abilities are amplified, which sometimes cause unpredictable results. Foundation staff reported seeing the news surrounding SCP-7121 appearing to change based on the thoughts or feelings of SCP-7121. For example, local audiences reported seeing a news report about a group of red squirrels repairing power lines after SCP-7121 had seen the squirrels doing so through a closed window.

Addendum: SCP-7121, if allowed to roam free, can cause a significant shift in reality. When interviewed, SCP-7121 has claimed that it has no knowledge of this ability and must be careful while working. Foundation research is ongoing, and SCP-7121 must be monitored.
