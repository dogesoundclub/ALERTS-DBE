Item #: 720

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-720 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with appropriate accommodations for a rabbit. He is to be provided with ample amounts of carrots and water, and a selection of routine items such as a clock and calendar. SCP-720 should be allowed to maintain a strict schedule and adhere to his routines to minimize any disturbance in his behavior.

Description: SCP-720 appears to be a male rabbit, approximately 2 feet tall, with a head adorned with a police cap and thick nerd glasses. SCP-720 is commonly seen wearing a silver chain pet collar around his neck and always carries a candy stick in his pocket.

Personality: SCP-720 is known to possess a strong sense of organization and is generally reliable in his duties. However, he can at times be rather stubborn, often refusing to accept new ideas or depart from his familiar routines. This trait has led to minor humorous mishaps, whereby he encounters new challenges or sudden changes in his environment.

SCP-720's primary job is that of a car salesman, and he has demonstrated the expected skill set in this profession. However, he is known toÂ display an unusual fixation with routine and appears to be uncommonly passionate about automobiles.

Addendum: SCP-720's fixation with automobiles was found to be an anomaly. SCP-720's body contains anomalies that give him the unique ability to control automobiles with his mind. Therefore, he is deemed a potential threat to public safety and must remain in Foundation custody indefinitely. Further research into these anomalies is required.
