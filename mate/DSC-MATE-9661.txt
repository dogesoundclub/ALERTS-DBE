SCP-9661, designated as a "politi-tiger," is a male humanoid tiger with striking VR Rainbow LED eyes, complete with a bucket hat and a red cross earring adorning its feline-esque ears. The tiger persona isn't just for show, as SCP-9661 is a genuine member of the species, capable of shifting between its bipedal and quadrupedal forms.

Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-9661 is known for its deep empathy and intuitive nature, possessing a unique understanding of those around it. This sensitivity can be a double-edged sword, with SCP-9661 often becoming easily moved by the suffering of others, manifesting as emotional outbursts or even tears.

SCP-9661 is also known for its fondness of animals and nature, often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a whistle, both of which have been observed to have a soothing effect on any nearby animals. While rare among its kind, the politi-tiger's compassionate nature makes it a valuable ambassador for its species, aiding in the peaceful coexistence of humans and supernatural creatures alike.
