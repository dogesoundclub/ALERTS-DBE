Item #: 1708

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1708 has agreed to cooperate with the Foundation and will remain under 24/7 surveillance in a designated safe house. Any attempts to remove her from her current location will result in disciplinary action.

Description: Subject 1708 is a female human with distinct orange stripes on her face and bright red lips. Her eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, enhancing her vision and allowing her to connect with various technological devices remotely. She wears a tiara on her head, with a goggle resting on her forehead. Her mouth is covered by a medical mask, which she refuses to remove for safety purposes. Subject 1708 also wears a silver chain around her neck as her personal accessory.

Personality: Subject 1708 is a fiercely analytical and logical individual, who enjoys debating or arguing with others for fun. These debates can often lead to seemingly trivial topics becoming heated arguments. Her tendency to reason with facts and logic has proven invaluable in her job as a programmer, making it difficult for her to connect with those who rely on emotions to make decisions. Despite her analytical nature, she has a keen sense of humor and can be playful when appropriate.  

Additional Notes: Subject 1708's unique features may raise suspicion from those unfamiliar with urban fantasy creatures. However, she has assured the Foundation that she is, in fact, a human who has gone through extensive modifications to enhance her abilities as a programmer. Any attempts to harm or coerce Subject 1708 will lead to severe consequences.
