Item #: 5732

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5732 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a wall-mounted feeding nozzle and high-pressure water hose. A psychiatric team is to be made available in the event of subject 5732 exhibiting aggressive or erratic behavior. Any objects or materials utilized by subject 5732 during artistic expression are to be closely monitored and removed from the chamber for analysis.

Description: DSC-MATE-5732 is a male simian of the species Macaca fuscata, commonly known as the Japanese macaque. Subject stands approximately 1 meter tall and weighs roughly 10 kilograms. DSC-MATE-5732 possesses blue clown eyes and a distinctive bucket hat atop its head. A gold earring is visible in its left ear, and it is frequently adorned with a gold chain and candy stick.

While DSC-MATE-5732 exhibits typical simian behavior, it also possesses a creative and artistic side that it expresses through various hobbies and interests. DSC-MATE-5732 frequently engages in painting, drawing, and writing, utilizing a variety of materials including watercolors and charcoal. DSC-MATE-5732's artwork is highly idiosyncratic, often depicting surreal landscapes populated by fantastical creatures.

DSC-MATE-5732's artistic expression is a source of both wonder and concern among Foundation personnel. While it has not exhibited any behavioral issues during its artistic pursuits, it has displayed a marked preference for materials and subjects that are highly anomalous in nature. DSC-MATE-5732's artwork has been shown to possess memetic properties that can cause visual distortions and altered states of consciousness in those who view it.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-5732 acquired a new piece of artistic equipment – a tablet computer. DSC-MATE-5732 quickly became engrossed in using the digital medium and began producing highly detailed and complex pieces of art far beyond what would be expected of its species. As these pieces continue to be produced, it is feared that DSC-MATE-5732 may be utilizing the tablet to gain access to anomalous information or communication with other anomalous entities. Further research into DSC-MATE-5732's artistic expression and anomalous abilities is ongoing.
