Item #: 9510

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9510 is believed to be securely contained within his own mafia underbelly operations. However, further observation and monitoring is required to ensure that he does not escape from his position of power or bring more danger to the general public.

Description: Item 9510 is a male human identified as the head of a notorious mafia organization. He is recognized by his unusual appearance, commonly described as a "frightened mouth" grin and distinctive glowing red eyes that resemble those of a clown. His hair is a bright shade of pink, parted stylishly to one side, and decorated with a green cross earring in his left ear.

The most noticeable accessory he wears is an LED gas mask, which hides most of his face and adds to his eerie and mysterious persona. Despite his odd appearance and intimidating behavior, Item 9510 has an unsual interest in giving gifts to others. He is very meticulous and attentive to details, making him an excellent gift-giver. However, he can also be overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift, leading him to absolute agony over deciding what to buy for someone.

Personnel are advised to steer clear from Item 9510's whereabouts and avoid any interactions with him. If a confrontational situation arises, immediate security escalation should be implemented, and all necessary steps should be taken to ensure the protection of the general public.
