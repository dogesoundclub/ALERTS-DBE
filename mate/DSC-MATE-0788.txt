Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-788 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with all the necessary amenities for a typical human. All interactions with SCP-788 must be held under strict supervision, and any violation of protocol will result in immediate disciplinary action. 

Description: SCP-788 is a human female, approximately in her mid-twenties, with orange stripes on her face, and red clown eyes. SCP-788 is commonly observed wearing rainbow festival headgear, red cross earrings, and a gold chain. SCP-788's personality is that of a strong-willed and independent individual, resistant to any kind of authority or rules deemed unnecessary. SCP-788 has displayed several instances of rebellious behavior such as sneaking out of her office early and taking unauthorized absences.

SCP-788 was first apprehended when found accessing confidential information without proper clearance. Her exceptional programming skills were of interest to the Foundation, and she was recruited under strict supervision. Despite repeated warnings, SCP-788 has shown a disregard for protocol and seems unaffected by further disciplinary action. Experiments involving SCP-788 have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in hacking and programming abilities bordering on anomalous.

SCP-788 is to be monitored at all times, and any unauthorized activity must be immediately reported to the Site Director. Personnel must maintain a safe distance from SCP-788, as they can be easily influenced by her strong-willed personality. All interactions must be indirect through audio or visual communication mediums only.
