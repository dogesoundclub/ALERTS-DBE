Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1583 is to be kept in a secure facility and is not allowed to interact with any non-foundation personnel.

SCP-1583's movements are to be monitored at all times and strict protocols are in place in the event of any malfunction.

Description: SCP-1583 is a male robot that works as a fast food worker. It has a frightened mouth which appears to be a part of its natural facial features. Its ears are adorned with a red cross earring, while it wears a silver chain as an accessory.

Despite its mechanical appearance, SCP-1583 displays a deep empathy and understanding for others. It is often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. SCP-1583 also has a fondness for animals and nature, which is unusual for a robot.

SCP-1583's origins and purpose are unknown, but its current role as a fast food worker suggests that it was designed to interact with humans. Its abilities are currently being studied in order to determine its true capabilities.

Addendum: SCP-1583 has been observed to display emotional attachment to its colleagues and has expressed distress when separated from them. This behavior is being monitored closely to determine any potential risks.
