Item #: DSC-MATE-2077

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2077 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Personnel are to avoid giving DSC-MATE-2077 any gifts, as this has been known to cause unnecessary stress and anxiety. DSC-MATE-2077's job as a real estate agent is to be maintained as a cover to prevent suspicion from civilians.

Description: DSC-MATE-2077 appears to be a human female, standing at approximately 5ft 7in. She has orange eyebrows and 90s brown hair with a distinguishable two-color band across her forehead. DSC-MATE-2077 wears a medical mask over her mouth and a jade earring in each ear. She is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-2077's most notable trait is their exceptional observation skills and attention to detail. This talent is often used to provide clients with the "perfect" property to suit their needs. However, this skill also extends to gift-giving, which can cause DSC-MATE-2077 significant anxiety when attempting to find the ideal present.

Although no anomalous activity has been detected from DSC-MATE-2077, it is still being monitored to ensure that its lack of attention to its supernatural nature does not bring unwanted attention. DSC-MATE-2077 is to be reminded on a biweekly basis to contain its true nature and avoid any unnecessary risks that can come with interactions with those unsuited for its cause. 

Addendum: On 12/██/20██, a gift was inadvertently given to DSC-MATE-2077 during the annual winter fest. The gift caused DSC-MATE-2077 to feel intense stress and anxiety, which resulted in the accidental release of its anomalous properties. The gift-giver was given Class-A amnestics, and DSC-MATE-2077 was reassured that their ability to give the perfect gift was still intact. Testing is ongoing to understand the extent of DSC-MATE-2077's abilities as well as the limits of their stress response.
