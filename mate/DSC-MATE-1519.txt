Item #: SCP-1519

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1519 is to be kept on-site as a security guard for the Foundation, with access only to authorized areas. SCP-1519's gas mask is to be kept in a secure locker and only used during emergency situations. Any impulsive behavior is to be reported immediately to their supervisor.

Description: SCP-1519 is a human male, with significant facial spots and a mohawk hairstyle. A cross-shaped green earring is visible in their left ear. SCP-1519 has a tendency to wear a gold chain and an LED gas mask on their person. SCP-1519 can be impulsive at times and tends to act on their emotions, leading to unexpected and amusing situations.

SCP-1519 was originally discovered during a security breach at a local amusement park, where they repelled the assailant single-handedly using park equipment. SCP-1519 was taken into custody by the Foundation, where they were noted to have exceptional reflexes and combat skills. It is believed that SCP-1519 developed these skills as a result of working in security and through exposure to dangerous situations.

SCP-1519 is currently working as security personnel for the Foundation and is considered a valuable member of the team. However, their impulsive behavior requires close monitoring to ensure the safety of themselves and their colleagues.

Addendum: During a recent security check, SCP-1519 was found to have modified their gas mask with unknown technology. Further research is being conducted to determine the nature and origin of these modifications.
