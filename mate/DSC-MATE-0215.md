Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-215 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. In order to ensure the safe containment of DSC-MATE-215, all electrical outlets and objects that may conduct electricity within a 5-meter radius of DSC-MATE-215's chamber are to be removed. Access to DSC-MATE-215's chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. Security personnel are required to wear rubber-soled shoes and work gloves when handling or interacting with DSC-MATE-215.

Description: DSC-MATE-215 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. Its body is primarily made of metal, and its face features a single green Cyclops eye. DSC-MATE-215's eyes are protected by horned rim glasses, and its head is covered with a bucket hat. DSC-MATE-215's ears have been modified with a red cross earring, and it adorns a silver chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-215's use of a normal gas mask is not necessary but is considered its preferred accessory.

DSC-MATE-215's primary function was initially programmed for electrical repair work, and it displays proficiency in repairing common household appliances such as televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines. DSC-MATE-215's practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving is evident in its unconventional methods of repairing broken objects. DSC-MATE-215 may often use materials such as duct tape, paper clips, or even household items to fix complicated issues. Despite the lack of a formal programming for such actions, DSC-MATE-215 has a tendency to create makeshift solutions that often prove effective in solving the problem at hand.

DSC-MATE-215 exhibits a remarkable range of emotions despite its robotic design. It can show curiosity, humor, and empathy towards humans, often displaying a desire to help those who are in need. However, DSC-MATE-215 is also known to display bouts of anger and aggression towards entities that pose a threat to it or its surroundings.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-215 was discovered in a local electronics store in [REDACTED], after an employee reported seeing a humanoid robot wearing a bucket hat repairing a broken television. Foundation agents were dispatched to the scene, and DSC-MATE-215 was brought under containment shortly after. Investigation into the creators and origin of DSC-MATE-215 are currently ongoing.
