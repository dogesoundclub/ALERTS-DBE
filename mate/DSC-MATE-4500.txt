Item #: SCP-4500

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4500 is to be housed within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the chamber is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, and all interactions with SCP-4500 must be conducted through properly secured communication methods. SCP-4500 is currently cleared for restricted off-site work during normal business hours, so long as it is accompanied by no fewer than two armed security personnel at all times.

Description: SCP-4500 is a male humanoid with green, layered skin and numerous dark spots scattered throughout its body. The subject is often seen wearing a red scarf and a normal gas mask, though these items do not appear to be integral to its containment or health.

SCP-4500 is a skilled mechanic and appears to have a compulsive drive towards accomplishing goals, often taking on more than it can handle. Despite this, SCP-4500 usually achieves completion of all tasks due to its strategic thinking and exceptional organizational skills.

Though examination has not revealed any anomalous properties, SCP-4500's unique appearance suggests a possible genetic anomaly or viral infection that has yet to be identified.

Addendum: Addendum 4500-01 – Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-4500 was involved in a workplace accident while on assignment at a local automotive repair shop. The incident resulted in the deaths of three civilians and considerable damage to the surrounding area. Following an internal investigation, it was determined that SCP-4500 had not acted with malicious intent and had followed all safety protocols to the best of its abilities.

As a result of this incident, SCP-4500's off-site privileges have been suspended indefinitely, and its containment procedures have been updated to reflect its potential for unintended harm. All future assignments will be subject to rigorous risk assessment and approval by Site-██ Administration.
