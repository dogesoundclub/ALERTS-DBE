Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4170 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, with provisions made to accommodate for their beastly nature. Any and all visitors must adhere to strict protocols established by containment specialists.

Description: Subject 4170 appears to be a male tiger, standing at approximately six feet tall on hind legs. He has donned a red beanie on his head, with a two-color band emblazoned across his forehead. The tiger's normal glasses sit upon his face, giving him an intelligent aura. The beast also wears a gold earring through his left ear, and a red scarf around his neck. On occasion, he carries a whistle, seemingly for no other reason than personal preference.

Personality: While subject 4170 may have a beastly appearance, his mind is anything but. A natural brainstormer, he revels in finding unconventional new solutions to problems, no matter how outlandish they may be. This has led to some comical situations, as his wild ideas often shock and bemuse his colleagues. 

Despite his jovial disposition, subject 4170 is not to be underestimated. He possesses a sharp wit and the ability to think on his feet, allowing him to successfully navigate through tricky situations. His status as a reporter has given him ample opportunity to hone these skills, as he is always on the lookout for a good story. 

In conclusion, while subject 4170 may seem charming and lighthearted, it's important to remember that he is still a dangerous predator at heart. Maintaining proper containment is necessary to ensure the safety of both himself and those around him.
