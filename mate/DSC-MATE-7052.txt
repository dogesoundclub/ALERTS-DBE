Item #: SCP-7052

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7052 is to be monitored at all times through surveillance cameras and undercover operatives. SCP-7052 is to be contained within a secure facility with limited access to the outside world. Any attempts by SCP-7052 to communicate with the public are to be intercepted and reviewed by Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-7052 appears as a female human with distinctive orange stripes on their face and purple lips. Their eyebrows are also orange, and they have green hair worn under a purple cap. SCP-7052's forehead features two colored bands and they wear a red cross earring as an accessory. They also wear a gold chain and smoke cigarettes regularly.

SCP-7052 is a politician known for their magnetic personality and ability to form deep connections with others. They possess a natural charisma that allows them to win over crowds and sway public opinion. SCP-7052 is known to have an endless supply of funny anecdotes and can quickly get strangers to open up about their lives.

SCP-7052's personality is a unique anomaly that has been observed by the Foundation. The subject's ability to connect with others on a deep level is unusual, but they do not appear to possess any known anomalous abilities. However, they have been known to bend certain rules and manipulate situations to their advantage.

Addendum: Despite SCP-7052's lack of anomalous abilities, their potential to influence public opinion makes them a valuable asset to GOI's and political parties. It is imperative that the Foundation maintains control over SCP-7052's communications and image to prevent unwanted interference.
