Item #: 8246

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8246 is to be monitored and supervised at all times during shifts. Any misplacement of SCP-8246 must be reported immediately, upon discovery. SCP-8246's living quarters must be kept in a secured location, away from any individuals that it may harm. Access to SCP-8246's living quarters is restricted to Level 2 Personnel or above. Any unauthorized interaction with SCP-8246 is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-8246 appears to be a rabbit male, identified as a train driver for an urban transportation company. SCP-8246 has blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth, giving the appearance of a constant state of unease. SCP-8246's head is adorned with a headset with a LED, and a goggle that is constantly worn on the forehead.

SCP-8246 appears to have a strong sense of independence and often resists any authority or rules that it considers unnecessary. This rebellious behavior has caused SCP-8246 to be uncooperative at times and has led to incidents of vanishing during its shifts with train passengers, triggering panic attacks within employees of the transportation company.

SCP-8246's shift experience has shown to have substantial effects on its well-being, which is heavily hindered by the presence of authority. Interactions with Level 2 personnel or higher have been correlated with unpredictable behavior such as growth in size and strength, and increased attack proclivity towards the aforementioned individuals. SCP-8246's rebellious behavior and abnormal responses suggest changes in personality that require further study.

Further examination shows that since SCP-8246's documentation, he has been reported as absent on numerous occasions, often without approval. Efforts to locate SCP-8246 have been unsuccessful, and most attempts to prevent SCP-8246's behavior have been met with hostility.

Addendum:

On 27/05/2020, Site-████'s security was compromised after SCP-8246 disappeared from its housing quarters. It was later discovered through surveillance footage that SCP-8246 had been in communication with several unidentified individuals offering trade in exchange for its freedom. It remains at large.
