Item #: 5852

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5852 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with modified ventilation to accommodate the use of her LED gas mask. All electronic devices that connect to any networking system are to be removed from the cell before allowing entry. Interaction with the subject should be limited to pre-approved testing sessions, supervised by at least two researchers. Any sudden changes in behavior or activity must be reported immediately to the appropriate personnel.

Description: Subject 5852 is a female human with typical height and weight of individuals of her age. Her most noticeable feature is the purple lipstick she wears which has an unknown chemical composition with anomalous properties. The modification to her gas mask is also unique with the addition of a layer of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) along the outer rim of the mask. She claims the mask can be used for both fashion and functionality. It is to be noted that the LEDs have an unexplained flashing pattern that seems to attract the attention of anyone around her.

Other notable features include her blonde hair which forms into a pair of wings on her head, and a jade earring on her left ear, that glows slightly under certain circumstances.

Subject 5852 exhibits an unconventional personality, prone to spontaneous and unpredictable behavior. She has a tendency to take risks without considering the potential risks or consequences, leading to dangerous or humorous experiences.

Conclusion: Until further investigation of the anomalous properties of her purple lipstick, jade earring, and LED gas mask can be completed, subject 5852 remains a potential risk for unpredictable behavior. Paranormal investigators are to be notified for possible connections between the object's anomalous properties and possible connections to other paranormal entities.
