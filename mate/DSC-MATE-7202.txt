SCP-7202, also known as "The Tiger Reporter", appears to be a male tiger with striking blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth that often quivers with anticipation. The subject wears a blue bandana around its head as well as a goggle on its forehead, a gold earring in one ear, and a vivid red scarf is draped around its neck. 

Despite its ferocious appearance, SCP-7202 exhibits a friendly and outgoing personality, often showing its humorous side with its dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor. However, it also possesses a sense of duty and responsibility that often gets it into trouble as it doesn't know when to back down from a story. 

SCP-7202's natural abilities as a tiger are enhanced by its job as a reporter. It is skilled at tracking down leads and interviewing important sources for its stories. It even carries a candy stick, which it claims helps calm its nerves during challenging situations. SCP-7202 is a valuable asset to the Foundation and should not be underestimated.
