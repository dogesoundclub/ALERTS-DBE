Item #: DSC-MATE-5259

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5259 is to be contained within a custom-made humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-5259 is restricted, and only personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher are allowed to interact with it. DSC-MATE-5259 is to be provided with a daily routine of tasks and responsibilities to fulfill its sense of duty, but is to be closely monitored to prevent it from overworking itself.

Description: DSC-MATE-5259 is a male rabbit of average proportions, measuring 60 cm in length and weighing approximately 4 kg. DSC-MATE-5259 possesses red clown eyes, which glow in low light conditions and can cause minor visual hallucinations in those who make direct eye contact. DSC-MATE-5259 is typically seen wearing a red beanie on its head, a gold earring on its left ear, and a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-5259 also carries a whistle at all times and may use it to issue commands to those around it.

DSC-MATE-5259 displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility that often leads it to take on more tasks than it can handle. While this trait can be useful in some situations, it has also resulted in humorous situations such as DSC-MATE-5259 attempting to carry too many items at once or being unable to fit all its responsibilities into a single day. DSC-MATE-5259 has been observed to become distressed when it cannot complete all its duties and may become aggressive towards others as a result.

DSC-MATE-5259 was initially discovered working as a theater manager in [REDACTED], where it was noted for its efficiency and dedication to its job. Foundation personnel were alerted to DSC-MATE-5259's anomalous properties when several individuals reported experiencing visual hallucinations after making eye contact with it. Foundation agents were able to contain DSC-MATE-5259 without incident and have since relocated it to Site-██ for further study.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5259 has been observed to display a high degree of intelligence and has been observed attempting to communicate in English. Further testing is ongoing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-5259's intelligence and whether it is able to comprehend complex concepts beyond its sense of duty and responsibility.
