Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3179's workplace must be monitored at all times to ensure his adherence to the rules and regulations of the train company.

Description: SCP-3179 is a human male, with a distinctive appearance that includes thick, nerd glasses, a police cap, green cross earring, and silver chain as accessories. He is also known to wear an LED gas mask when operating the trains, which is not part of his required uniform. SCP-3179 works as a train driver, and he is known to have a rebellious streak that can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior.

SCP-3179 often takes unnecessary risks, disobeying rules and protocols for his amusement. His actions can result in humorous situations, but they also increase the risk of injury or even death for himself and others. Despite numerous reprimands and warnings, SCP-3179 continues to seek out new ways to push boundaries and challenge authority.

SCP-3179's behavior may be attributed to his desire for excitement and variety, leading him to take risks that others would not. However, this behavior also indicates a lack of judgment and disregard for safety that cannot be tolerated within the organized workforce. As such, SCP-3179 must be closely monitored, and all possible measures must be taken to ensure that his behavior is kept in check for his own safety, as well as that of others.  

Note: SCP-3179 is not currently deemed a danger to society. He is not considered to be a threat to the safety of the general public, and his current containment measures are sufficient for his classification as a Safe object.
