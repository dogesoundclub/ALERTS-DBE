Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3156 is to be contained in a maximum-security facility with the strictest possible security measures.

Description: DSC-MATE-3156 is a female human identified by the Foundation as a Mafia Boss. Her physical appearance is unremarkable, save for the VR Jade LED eyes and the gold earrings she wears. DSC-MATE-3156's main anomaly is her tendency towards deep introspection, which can often lead to her becoming completely unaware of her surroundings, including any potential dangers.

Personnel who have interacted with DSC-MATE-3156 describe her personality as detached and aloof, with a propensity for being lost in thought. This can pose a significant risk as DSC-MATE-3156 has been known to walk into walls, trip over objects, and bump into other people while lost in thought.

DSC-MATE-3156's unique abilities to manipulate her environment, assess risks, and plan accordingly have made her an invaluable asset to the Mafia family she is associated with. However, her capabilities have also made her a prime target for other hostile groups who wish to neutralize her.

Due to DSC-MATE-3156's connections with various mafia syndicates, the Foundation has taken extensive measures to prevent any information leaks or risk of exposure to their anomalous activities.

Addendum: Despite DSC-MATE-3156's apparent mildness, she has been associated with several violent incidents linked to her connections with the Mafia family. Any sightings or encounters with DSC-MATE-3156 must be reported immediately to the assigned personnel.
