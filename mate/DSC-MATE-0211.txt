SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

SCP-211, also known as "The Banker," is a male tiger of indeterminate age that has exhibited unique traits and abilities beyond that of a typical tiger. SCP-211's eyes are unknown due to his tendency to keep them hidden. SCP-211 typically covers his head with a blue bandana and wears a jade earring in one ear. SCP-211 also wears a medical mask over his mouth, which he refuses to remove in front of Foundation staff.

SCP-211 currently works as a banker, utilizing his natural talents for leadership to take charge of his workplace. He is well-respected by his peers and often takes on tasks that others are unwilling to do. SCP-211 is calm and collected under pressure, making him an invaluable asset in high-stress situations.

SCP-211's abilities extend beyond his natural leadership skills. He has demonstrated a keen sense of financial savvy, predicting market trends and investments with uncanny accuracy. SCP-211 has also shown the ability to manipulate financial markets, altering stock prices and financial statistics to benefit himself and his employer. This ability has caught the attention of the Foundation, which has placed him under constant surveillance to monitor his actions.

SCP-211's personality is one of determined pragmatism. He is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed, whether through honest means or otherwise. SCP-211 is fiercely loyal to those he deems worthy of his trust but remains guarded and secretive about his personal life. SCP-211 has exhibited no signs of aggression or hostility towards Foundation staff but remains wary and cautious in their presence.

SCP-211's unique abilities make him a valuable asset to the Foundation's efforts in understanding anomalous financial practices. However, his manipulative tendencies and secretive nature make him a potential threat to Foundation operations. As such, SCP-211's containment remains a top priority for Foundation personnel.
