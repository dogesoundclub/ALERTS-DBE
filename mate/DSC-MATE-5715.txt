Item #: SCP-5715

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5715 is to be kept in secure quarters at Site-██. Personnel are required to wear protective gear, including gas masks and full-body suits, when interacting with SCP-5715. Any communications with SCP-5715 must be conducted through written notes or electronic devices to minimize the risk of exposure to its anomalous properties. In addition, SCP-5715's access to any flammable substances must be strictly restricted to avoid any accidental incidents.

Description: SCP-5715 is a human female, appearing to be in her mid-20s, standing at 1.68 meters tall and weighing approximately 64 kg. SCP-5715 works as a firefighter in the local fire department and consistently displays professionalism and efficiency in carrying out her duties. However, SCP-5715 has several unusual physical traits that set her apart from an ordinary human.

SCP-5715's head appears to be completely covered in green flames, which curl and flicker as if constantly moving. Despite being in constant proximity to flames, SCP-5715 does not appear to experience any heat or pain from them. SCP-5715's eyes are notable for their bright blue color and clown-like appearance. SCP-5715's lips always appear to be painted with bright red lipstick, which never fades.

In addition to these physical traits, SCP-5715 is always seen wearing a golden hoop earring and a choker necklace. SCP-5715's personality is characterized by a mixture of organization and spontaneity. While SCP-5715 enjoys planning ahead, she has been known to surprise her colleagues with impromptu adventures and parties, which are always successful.

SCP-5715's anomalous properties become apparent when she is exposed to flames. Rather than being harmed by them, SCP-5715 displays a remarkable power over fire. SCP-5715 can manipulate flames with her mind, extinguish them instantly, and even summon them from thin air. SCP-5715's powers appear to be strongest when she is in danger or needs to protect others.

Addendum: SCP-5715 was discovered during a routine fire call in downtown ██████, when SCP-5715 displayed her powers in public. The Foundation was alerted to the incident, and SCP-5715 was brought in for testing and containment. SCP-5715 remains cooperative and has expressed a willingness to assist the Foundation in any way possible. Further research is underway to understand the nature and extent of SCP-5715's anomalous abilities.
