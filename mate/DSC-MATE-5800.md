Item #: 5800

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5800 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in a secure area of Site-██. Due to its species being a rabbit, all personnel must wear Level 2 protective gear at all times when interacting with him to avoid causing any distress.

Description: 5800 is a male rabbit with a distinct hoodie that covers its head. The forehead of the creature bears a 2 Color Band, which initially was thought to be a natural marking on its fur. However, upon examination, it is discovered that the band appears to have been tattooed, leading to more questions than answers. 

5800, despite being a banker, exhibits absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. When lost in thought or working on a project, it appears it can become so engrossed in its work that it misses crucial appointments or events. However, while these situations can cause humorous outcomes, it is suspected that they may be more than just absent-mindedness or forgetfulness. 

Personnel that have spent more than a few moments around 5800 report feeling light-headed and appearing to lose track of time. There is a suggestion that 5800 may exhibit low-level reality-warping, potentially without even realizing it. As 5800 continues to exhibit these anomalies in behavior, it is essential that the containment procedures are strictly followed to avoid any unpredictable outcomes.

Addendum: Further testing on 5800 is ordered to determine any unique abilities it might possess. Until then, 5800 is to undergo daily cognitive and psychological evaluations to ensure its mental wellbeing.
