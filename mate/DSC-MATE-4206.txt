Item #: 4206

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4206 is to be allowed unrestricted movement within the local urban area. However, over-exposure to crowds or social events must be monitored, and the subject must be taken away from such situations if necessary. Additionally, interaction with non-anomalous human beings must be kept at a minimum to prevent accidental discovery of its anomalous traits.

Description: 4206 is a male humanoid with a unique appearance, sporting bright orange stripes on its facial features. It wears opaque nerd glasses over its eyes and a retro cap atop its head. Its ears are adorned with a bold green cross earring, while its neck is graced with a gold chain. Subject 4206's most notable feature is the standard gas mask it wears at all times, regardless of the situation.

4206 exhibits a unique personality that is outgoing, affable and sociable, often craving attention and actively engaging with those around them. This tendency often results in various humorous situations, ranging from an amusing anecdote to hilarious jokes that always leave individuals around them collapsed in fits of laughter.

However, it is necessary to note that prolonged exposure to social gatherings can cause unpredictable consequences, resulting in fatal events for those within close proximity. We strongly advise against allowing the subject to wander off into large crowds, as those around them might suddenly burst into unstoppable laughter.

Addendum: Despite its extreme nature, Subject 4206 is harmless and offers valuable insight into the anomalous beings present within the urban area. Its salesmanship skills make it an asset in gathering intelligence and selling anomalous objects to individuals of interest. In conclusion, 4206's anomalous skills might be a blessing or a curse, requiring cautious management to prevent undesirable outcomes.
