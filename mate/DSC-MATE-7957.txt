Item #: SCP-7957

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7957 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber that is fitted with a medical workstation, a beauty salon set up, and a computer connected to the internet. Cameras are to be active 24/7 for surveillance purposes. If SCP-7957 needs to leave its chamber, it must be escorted by no less than two guards.

Description: SCP-7957 is a human female, standing at approximately 5'6" in height and weighing 132 lbs. The subject's face is marked with spots, and she is often observed wearing a purple cap with green hair underneath. Her VR Rainbow LED eyes are a distinctive physical feature. She wears a choker around her neck and an earring in the shape of a red cross.

SCP-7957 is a trained beautician, and her sense of duty and responsibility is such that she habitually takes on more than she can handle. This has resulted in instances where she is unable to fit all of the tasks into a single day or tries to carry too many things at once.

The use of a medical mask covering her mouth and a goggle on her forehead is a safety measure to prevent contamination. Her personality is such that SCP-7957 is prone to friendly and helpful behavior, even when not expected, which shows adaptability and excellent communication skills.

SCP-7957 is amicable towards Foundation personnel and willingly interacts with them, making it easier for her to maintain good mental health while in custody.

Addendum: At the request of SCP-7957, permission has been granted for her to have limited access to beauty products and perform her job on willing Foundation staff members. This has improved her mental stability and decreased tendencies to feel isolated.
