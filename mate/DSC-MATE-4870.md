Item #: 4870

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4870 is to be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards. Although he is a humanoid of a typical Homo sapien composition, he is considered a danger. Therefore, he will only be given access to limited areas of the facility.

Description: Subject 4870 is a middle-aged human male with red clown eyes, a prominent mouth spot, and a smile that never fades. He has a head full of hair, often covered by a retro cap. He is also known for sporting a gold earring on his left ear and a cigarette in between his lips. Although his physical attributes are not the cause of his listing, it is his vivacious personality that raises concern. 

He is fond of company and being the center of attention. This often leads to him telling humorous jokes and stories that compel his audience into fits of uncontrollable laughter. In social settings where he is unable to garner a crowd or an audience, his demeanor shifts, becoming that of a desperate entertainer. 

Subject 4870's ability to charm his way into people's good graces and manipulate them poses a danger to our organization. He should not be allowed to roam free and must be interrogated cautiously, with his reception and the effectiveness of his oratory skills taken into account to avoid unneeded casualties.

Addendum: Subject 4870 claims to be a banker by occupation; however, his ability to seamlessly weave in and out of social settings and his manipulation skills raise the question of his legitimacy. It is suspected he has ulterior motives, and more information will be extracted.
