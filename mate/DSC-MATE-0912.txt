Item #: 912

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 912 is to be kept under observation at all times. She is to be monitored for any signs of stress or exhaustion, as these can cause an unpredictable and potentially dangerous reaction. Any attempts to manipulate or influence her behavior should be immediately reported to the Foundation.

Description: Subject 912 is a female human politician, with noticeably purple lips and normal glasses. She is often seen wearing a retro cap and a green cross earring, as well as a choker around her neck. Despite her seemingly innocuous appearance, her strong sense of duty and responsibility have made her a dangerous and unpredictable entity.

Subject 912 has shown an unusual capacity for taking on more responsibilities than she can handle, resulting in unusual and often humorous situations. For example, she has been observed attempting to carry too many objects at once or struggling to fit all of her tasks into a single day. This capacity for self-sacrifice has made her a beloved figure among her constituents, but it also raises concerns about the potential for her to self-destruct.

Due to the potential danger posed by Subject 912's unstable behavior, she must be closely monitored at all times. Any attempts to manipulate or influence her behavior must be reported immediately to the Foundation. Failure to comply with these procedures may result in catastrophic consequences for the world at large.
