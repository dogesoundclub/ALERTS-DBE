Item #: 1922

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As with all humanoid anomalies, 1922 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with amenities appropriate for a humanoid entity. 1922 is to be kept away from any electronic devices that could potentially tamper with its LED headset, and any sharp objects are to be kept out of its reach. Interaction with 1922 should be supervised at all times to prevent emotional disturbance.

Description: 1922 is a political figure that appears to be a robot-like entity. The head of 1922 is adorned with a green cyclops eye and a headset with LED. The mouth of 1922 is covered with a medical mask, and its eyes are visible through horned rim glasses. It often wears a red scarf as an accessory. 1922's overall appearance resembles that of a humanoid robot, with a metallic exterior and a noticeable clanking sound when in motion.

Personality: Despite being a robot, 1922 has displayed human-like emotions and behaviors. It tends to be very empathetic and compassionate, often feeling responsible for the welfare of others. This has led to 1922 taking on other people's problems as its own, leading to burnout and exhaustion. 1922 possesses a strong sense of morality and justice, which has influenced its political decisions. While its willingness to help others can be admirable, it often leads to 1922 becoming too invested in the problems of those around it, potentially leading to emotional instability.

Addendum: Due to 1922's emotional capabilities and political influence, it has been suggested that its potential as an espionage agent should be examined. However, such experiments are considered too risky due to the emotional strain it would put on 1922. Observation of 1922 should continue so that any future behavioral changes can be documented.
