Item Number: SCP-8551

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8551 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. Due to her impulsive nature, SCP-8551 is not to be allowed access to any sharp objects, heavy machinery or any items that may induce an emotional response. SCP-8551 is allowed to leave her containment chamber for commercial purposes under the escort of two armed security personnel.

Description: SCP-8551 is a human female with spotted skin, metal blue hair and a red cross earring which she often wears on her left ear. SCP-8551 wears a medical mask to cover what is presumed to be severe cosmetic damage to her face, which is currently not known if it has any anomalous properties. SCP-8551 is known to wear a silver chain around her neck, although the reason for this is unknown. 

SCP-8551 is a car salesman, although her impulsive nature tends to result in her being more of a spontaneous decision maker. SCP-8551 has a tendency to act on her emotions, sometimes without thinking things through, frequently resulting in amusing situations for others. SCP-8551's emotions may manifest themselves in anomalous ways, which she is currently unaware of. 

SCP-8551 was recovered on ██/██/████ after multiple reports of strange occurrences linked to the sale of used cars in ███████. Further investigation revealed that SCP-8551 had been involved in a deal that resulted in the spontaneous combustion of one of the cars she had sold. She was detained for questioning and found to have no knowledge of any anomalous properties. 

Addendum: SCP-8551 has expressed a desire to find a cure for her skin condition in order to remove her medical mask. Investigators are currently researching this.
