Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #7507 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, which must be checked daily for any damage.

Description: Item #7507 appears to be a monkey, standing roughly three feet tall, with blue clown eyes and a purple cap fitted with a headset. The monkey is always seen with a red scarf, which it seems to cherish greatly. The monkey exhibits a scared facial expression, with a frightened mouth that often trembles.

Personality: While not exhibiting any unusual behavior or abilities, Item #7507 has been observed to be reliable and organized, particularly in its capacity as a mechanic. However, it can also display a stubborn personality, which can lead to some humorous situations, particularly when faced with unexpected challenges. Despite its quirks, Item #7507 is a valuable asset to any team, providing valuable mechanical support and engineering skills.

Location: Item #7507 was recovered from a circumscribed area in the Amazon rainforest and was brought to the Foundation's attention, following reports of strange behavior of local wildlife in the area. The monkey was initially believed to be contaminated by an anomalous substance, but further examination revealed no such contamination. The monkey was then brought to the Foundation for further study.

Addendum: Despite its seemingly benign nature, Item #7507 has shown some unusual behavior in the past. On one occasion, when given a new tool, the monkey appeared to become agitated and threw the tool across the room. The monkey's attachment to its red scarf has also raised some questions, particularly given the lack of any known cultural significance to monkeys. Further study is required to determine if these behaviors are significant or simply random occurrences.
