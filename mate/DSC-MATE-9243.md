Description: DSC-MATE-9243 is a male tiger humanoid, standing approximately 2 meters tall. DSC-MATE-9243's head is adorned with a police cap with a 2 color band around its forehead. It also has goggles resting atop its forehead and a medical mask covering its mouth. DSC-MATE-9243 is often seen wearing a red scarf as its accessory.

DSC-MATE-9243 possesses a laid-back and easy-going personality, which often comes in contrast to its fierce loyalty and protectiveness towards its loved ones. It has been observed to engage in heated arguments when someone insults or threatens its family or friends. DSC-MATE-9243's profession is a car salesman.

DSC-MATE-9243's uniqueness lies in its ability to "roar" using an unknown method when confronted with danger or aggression. This roar temporarily immobilizes a target within 12 meters of DSC-MATE-9243. DSC-MATE-9243 is also known for its enhanced physical abilities as well as a keen sense of smell, hearing, and night vision which allows it to detect and evade danger.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9243 was initially encountered at a used car dealership in the suburbs, where it was employed as a salesman. Foundation agents noted its anomalous abilities and brought it into containment. DSC-MATE-9243 has been cooperative so far and has not shown any signs of resistance or hostility towards personnel. Further research is ongoing.

Note: Researchers are advised to exercise caution when handling DSC-MATE-9243. Its loyalty could be exploited, making it a potential asset or danger in covert operations.
