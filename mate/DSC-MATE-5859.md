ID # : DSC-MATE-5859
Description: Item 5859 is a male robot, resembling that of a typical fast food worker. It stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 150 pounds. Its headwear consists of a purple cap with a built-in headset, enabling it to communicate with customers and colleagues. Its most distinctive feature is its green cyclops eye, which serves as its primary visual input device. The robot wears normal glasses over its two other eyes, probably to blend in better with its human co-workers. The robot has a jade earring on its ear, which serves no discernible function besides aesthetic purposes. It also adorns a red scarf around its neck, to the confusion of its human colleagues.
