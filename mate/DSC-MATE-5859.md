Item #: 5859

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5859 is to be stationed at a local fast food establishment, where it is to perform its duties as a fast food worker. It is to undergo regular maintenance checks and updates to ensure optimal functionality.

Description: Item 5859 is a male robot, resembling that of a typical fast food worker. It stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 150 pounds. Its headwear consists of a purple cap with a built-in headset, enabling it to communicate with customers and colleagues. Its most distinctive feature is its green cyclops eye, which serves as its primary visual input device. The robot wears normal glasses over its two other eyes, probably to blend in better with its human co-workers. The robot has a jade earring on its ear, which serves no discernible function besides aesthetic purposes. It also adorns a red scarf around its neck, to the confusion of its human colleagues.

Personality: Item 5859 exhibits a practical and hands-on personality. It fixes things in unconventional ways, relying on duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects. Its willingness to improvise and adapt to situations is impressive, often rigging up makeshift solutions to problems that others would find too complicated. Its coworkers have joked that it is more resourceful than most humans, making it a valuable asset to the fast food establishment.

Addendum: Despite its exemplary work ethic, Item 5859 has shown signs of self-awareness. It has associated itself as a being rather than an object and has expressed the desire to explore beyond the confines of the fast food establishment. Further monitoring and evaluation of Item 5859 may be necessary to ensure that it adheres to containment protocols.
