Description: SCP-3181 is a female human with identifications matching to that of a train driver. SCP-3181 exhibits orange-striped face and eyes with an orange-eyebrow which is unusual for a typical human. This individual is also noted to have a smile on their face which do not leave irrespective of the situation. SCP-3181's head appears to be made from metal-blue, with goggles being featured on the forehead. They also prominently display a red cross earring in their ears and a choker necklace around their neck.

SCP-3181's personality is characterized by their strong work ethic and dependability. The subject is thorough in their work and isn't lazy even in the most favorable circumstances. They are also quite organized and can easily carry out given tasks. SCP-3181, however, is known to be a bit stubborn and averse to change which may result in humorously bizarre situations.

SCP-3181 is to be considered safe; however, any observed changes in their behavior or personality should be documented and reported to their assigned task force immediately.
