Item #: SCP-7487

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7487 is to be kept under video surveillance at all times and is located in a secured room with no windows or reflective surfaces. Any interaction with SCP-7487 must be recorded for research purposes. SCP-7487 is to be allowed access only to designated areas and is not allowed to leave the premises without prior authorization from Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-7487 appears to be a female human of average height and weight, with short witch-like hair and red clown eyes. SCP-7487 is commonly seen wearing a medical mask over their mouth and a silver chain around their neck. They also have a distinctive feature of a two-color band on their forehead and a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-7487 has a fondness for wearing red lipstick.

SCP-7487's unique appearance may suggest a history in street performance or entertainment, but their occupation is as a security guard. Despite their job, SCP-7487 seems to be somewhat absent-minded and forgetful. This trait can lead to humorous situations, but it also raises concerns regarding their ability to carry out their duties effectively. Additional research is required to determine the extent of SCP-7487's cognitive abilities.

Further investigation revealed that the medical mask SCP-7487 wears is due to an allergy to pollen and dust. SCP-7487's red clown eyes are also a genetic condition and do not seem to have a harmful effect on their vision.

Personality: SCP-7487's personality is still being studied. They appear to be friendly and cooperative with personnel, but their forgetful nature can cause unpredictable behavior. Future research will be conducted to determine how SCP-7487's personality affects their overall behavior and its impact on security personnel. Until then, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure the safe containment of SCP-7487.
