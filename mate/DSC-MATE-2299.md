Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2299 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be furnished with a writing desk, a computer, and a comfortable chair for the subject’s daily use. Due to DSC-MATE-2299’s fondness for tradition, it is recommended to supply traditional rabbit toys and food in the chamber as an incentive for cooperation. 

Description: DSC-MATE-2299 is a male rabbit of average size and weight. DSC-MATE-2299’s physical traits include blue clown eyes, a red beanie on its head, a red victory band on its forehead, and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, DSC-MATE-2299 is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a whistle on its person. While DSC-MATE-2299 appears to be a common domesticated rabbit, its personality displays a mix of serious and playful traits. DSC-MATE-2299 values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude, but it can often be found engaging in humorous situations such as telling jokes and stories passed down through its family or community. 

DSC-MATE-2299’s primary interest and occupation is programming. It has displayed an expert level of IT skills and can write code in various programming languages. Despite not possessing human-like hands, DSC-MATE-2299 can operate a standard computer keyboard without difficulty. Additionally, it has a habit of naming its programs and projects after famous rabbits, such as Bugs Bunny and Peter Rabbit. 

DSC-MATE-2299 was discovered in a public park in [REDACTED] when Foundation agents responded to a report of a rabbit that appeared to be browsing the internet on a laptop. DSC-MATE-2299 was initially distrustful of Foundation personnel, but eventually cooperated after being offered traditional rabbit toys and food. DSC-MATE-2299 was then brought to the nearest containment site for further study.

Addendum 2299-1: During a routine check of DSC-MATE-2299’s living area, Foundation personnel discovered a hidden stash of unusual items including a tattered book of rabbit folklore, a feather quill, a bottle of ink, and several ancient scrolls. DSC-MATE-2299 demonstrated great interest in these items, particularly the book on folklore, which it later claimed was passed down through its ancestral line. Further investigation is ongoing. 

Addendum 2299-2: Neither DSC-MATE-2299’s origin nor the extent of its knowledge on rabbit folklore could be ascertained. DSC-MATE-2299, at this time, poses no immediate danger but is to be monitored closely for any unusual activity or behavior.
