Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2524 is to be monitored via electronic surveillance at all times.

Subject 2524 is not to be directly approached or interacted with without authorization from at least one Level 3 researcher.

Description: Subject 2524 is a male human of average height and build, with a distinctive mouth spot and ski goggle-like eyes. The subject is often seen wearing a red beanie, green cross earring, gold chain, and carrying a candy stick.

The subject is a highly successful politician, having been elected to several prominent positions throughout their career. However, it is important to note that the subject's policies and initiatives have almost exclusively focused on their own personal gain or financial benefit, rather than the well-being of the citizens they claim to serve.

Personality-wise, subject 2524 can be both reliable and organized, but also intensely stubborn. They cling to outdated routines and are highly resistant to change, often leading to bizarre and humorous situations when encountered with unexpected challenges or shifts in their worldview.

Addendum: Several attempts have been made to subdue or neutralize the subject, as many believe them to possess certain anomalous or mind-altering abilities that allow them to maintain their position of power. These attempts have thus far been unsuccessful, and further investigation is required.
