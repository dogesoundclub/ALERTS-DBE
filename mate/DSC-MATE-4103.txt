SCP Containment Breach report: specimen 4103 is a rabbit humanoid, designated as a Security Guard. The subject possesses a unique physical appearance, wearing a red beanie hat adorned with a set of horned rim glasses over their energetic eyes. The rabbit ears adorned with a gold earring are elongated and asymmetrical, indicating that specimen 4103 was transfigured using anomalous means.

Observations of subject 4103 suggest that they possess a boisterous and excitable personality. When discussing topics of interest, their energy levels are known to spike and can become infectious to those around them. In contrast, when subject 4103 engages in interactions that don't pique their interest, they may become disinterested or overtly bored, resulting in a lack of focus.

Of particular importance is their accessory, a silver chain that appears to have been fused to specimen 4103's neck, possibly preventing escape or unauthorized removal from the containment facility. Though the origin of the object remains ambiguous, it is advised that the chain is never removed or tampered with, as it may activate a potential containment breach.

Overall, subject 4103 requires close and attentive monitoring, particularly in times of high-stress or periods of confinement, to avoid unexpected outbursts that could pose a risk to staff, personnel, or the containment facility.
