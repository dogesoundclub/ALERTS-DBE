SCP-4624 is a Train Driver employed by the city's urban transit system. As a human, he possesses several distinguishing features that make him stand out from the crowd. Firstly, he has scattered spots dotted across his face, giving him a unique appearance. Secondly, his mouth appears to be consistently in a state of fright, as if he's scared of something or someone.

SCP-4624's eyes, peering out from behind the nerd glasses he often wears, display intelligence and a hint of mischief. His head is adorned with several layers of green hair, yet another odd characteristic that sets him apart. His green cross earring, noticeable only when he tilts his head, suggests a certain level of spiritual or religious affiliation.

Despite his slight eccentricities, SCP-4624's fashion choices are generally modest, with the exception of the bright red scarf he sometimes wears. The medical mask that frequently covers his mouth makes it difficult to gauge his expressions, but his demeanor indicates a friendly and inquisitive personality. SCP-4624 enjoys brainstorming and presenting new ideas, sometimes to the point of absurdity, just to observe the reactions of those around him.
