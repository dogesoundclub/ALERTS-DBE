Item #: SCP-49

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-49 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-49 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. All interactions with SCP-49 must be conducted through a communication system equipped with a speaker and a camera. SCP-49's requests are to be monitored and granted at the discretion of the nearest available guard.

Description: SCP-49 is a humanoid entity resembling a tiger with a height of approximately 2 meters. SCP-49 dresses in human clothing, typically wearing a white lab coat and horn-rimmed glasses over their feline face. SCP-49's head is covered in an unkempt green mane, and they typically have a two-colored band across their forehead and a goggle resting on top. They also wear a gold earring on each ear and carry a silver chain as an accessory. SCP-49 is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-49 is a medical doctor and is proficient in anatomy, physiology, and toxicology. SCP-49 can read and speak many different languages and is considered to be of above-average intelligence. SCP-49 also has a notable sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This often leads to SCP-49 telling amusing anecdotes or performing playful impersonations to lighten the mood, even in the most dire of situations.

SCP-49 is, for the most part, amiable and cooperative with Foundation personnel, although they can become easily frustrated when they feel their expertise is not being utilized to their full potential. SCP-49 is considered safe, and their containment is mainly for their protection, as they are vulnerable outside of their containment chamber. Researchers are encouraged to utilize SCP-49's medical knowledge and humor, as both have been found to be useful in containing other SCPs.
