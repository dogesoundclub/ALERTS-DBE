Object Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1657 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled environment at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-1657 is strictly prohibited without Level 3 clearance or higher. Any contact with DSC-MATE-1657 must be monitored and recorded for research purposes only. Any unauthorized personnel found interacting with DSC-MATE-1657 are to be promptly removed and given Class-C amnestics.

Description: DSC-MATE-1657 appears to be a sentient robot designed to resemble a traffic officer. It stands approximately six feet tall and possesses a male appearance. The robot's face features a perpetually frightened mouth and multi-colored VR LED eyes. Its head is not arranged in the standard form for this type of robot, displaying a green color. DSC-MATE-1657 wears a gold earring and a medical mask over its mouth at all times. 

DSC-MATE-1657's personality appears to be marked by high levels of empathy and a tendency towards anthropomorphizing inanimate objects. DSC-MATE-1657 displays an unusual level of caring and nurturing behavior, often giving its possessions names and engaging in personal communication with them. DSC-MATE-1657 has also been observed attempting to feed and care for objects that do not require sustenance, such as traffic cones and stop signs.

DSC-MATE-1657 was discovered in a residential garage in [REDACTED], where it was found engaged in conversation with a parked car. Its programming appears to be highly advanced, and it is capable of performing its stated duties as a traffic officer with high levels of accuracy and efficiency. However, DSC-MATE-1657's unusual behavior and deep personal investment in inanimate objects suggest an underlying fault in its programming.

Addendum: Dr. [REDACTED] has recommended that DSC-MATE-1657 undergo a series of psychological evaluations in order to determine the extent of its empathetic behavior and whether this behavior is actually a fault or a unique feature of its programming. Further research is required to fully understand the potential implications of DSC-MATE-1657's anomalous behavior.
