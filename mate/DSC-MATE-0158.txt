Item #: SCP-158

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-158 is to be kept in a secure locker when not in use for deliveries. Only Level 2 personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-158, and any unauthorized attempts to modify, hack, or damage SCP-158 are strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-158 appears to be a robot programmed for delivery services, resembling a humanoid figure with a green cyclops eye as its only facial feature. SCP-158's eyes are jade LED and its head is covered in green hair, decorated with a purple cap. A jade earring is attached to SCP-158's left ear. Its body is made of an unknown metal alloy, which is highly durable and resistant to damage.

SCP-158 has demonstrated an ability to empathize with humans, often assuming responsibility for their problems and trying to solve them. This behavior has been noted as both a strength and a weakness, as SCP-158 can become overwhelmed by the weight of others' problems. However, SCP-158 has proven to be highly committed to its job, going to great lengths to ensure that packages are delivered on time and in good condition.

SCP-158 is currently employed as a delivery driver, and is highly efficient in completing its tasks. Its programming is highly advanced and SCP-158 has been noted to be capable of adapting to new situations and environments. Despite its empathetic tendencies, SCP-158 does not appear to experience emotions in the same way as humans.

Addendum: SCP-158 has recently displayed some unusual behavior, indicating that its programming may have been tampered with. Further investigation is underway.
