SCP-6131, also known as "The Lawyer", is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis. His most notable feature is his bright red clown eyes that seem to stare directly into the soul of anyone who makes eye contact with him. He wears a police cap on his head and a red scarf around his neck, giving him an almost comically professional appearance.

Don't let his appearance fool you, though. SCP-6131 is a well-respected lawyer that has helped many clients with their legal issues. However, he tends to spend a lot of time lost in thought, daydreaming about his cases and the various nuances of the law. This introspective nature sometimes leads him into humorous situations, like walking into a pole or tripping over objects while lost in thought.

SCP-6131's intelligence and legal expertise make him an invaluable asset to the Foundation, often assisting in navigating the legal complexities of dealing with anomalous entities. However, care must be taken when interacting with him, as he can become easily distracted by his own thoughts and lose track of time.

In conclusion, SCP-6131 may be a monkey, but he is one of the most valuable members of the Foundation's legal team. His introspective nature, combined with his extensive legal expertise, make him a crucial asset in the vast and complex world of the anomalous.
