Item #: DSC-MATE-7923

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7923 is housed within a standard primate containment chamber within secure, reinforced walls. The subject should always have access to a variety of toys and games to keep it occupied, as idle time can lead to increased introspection and possible escape attempts. DSC-MATE-7923's red scarf and candy stick should be kept within the containment chamber at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-7923 appears to be a monkey of unknown species, with a green, unarranged head and distinctive two-color band across its forehead. The subject's eyes are unknown due to its proclivity for wearing sunglasses at all times. It is often seen clutching a red scarf and candy stick.

DSC-MATE-7923 has displayed an unusually introspective personality, often becoming lost in thought for extended periods of time. This can lead to humorous situations, such as tripping over its own feet or walking into walls while distracted. However, this trait also makes the subject prone to sudden, unexplained outbursts of violence or escape attempts.

DSC-MATE-7923's occupation as a beautician is a result of its ability to create elaborate hairstyles for itself and others using found materials within the containment chamber. Facial recognition technology has identified several celebrities, politicians, and high-profile individuals among DSC-MATE-7923's clientele, leading Foundation researchers to suspect that the subject may possess anomalous abilities related to glamour or enchantment.

Note: Under no circumstances is any personnel to make physical contact with DSC-MATE-7923. The subject has demonstrated a strong preference for solitude and may react violently to unwanted attention. Treat with caution.
