Item #: SCP-3803

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3803 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times when not performing its job as a delivery driver. SCP-3803 is to be fed a diet of raw meat and allowed access to toys and objects for cognitive stimulation. Daily medical checkups must be performed to ensure the health of SCP-3803.

SCP-3803 is allowed to continue its employment as a delivery driver for the cover story that it is a member of a fur suit group. Foundation surveillance is to be maintained at all times during its work hours to ensure SCP-3803 does not reveal its true nature to the general public.

Description: SCP-3803 is a male Tiger with unique physical features. Its eyes resemble clown makeup, with bright blue markings around its pupils. SCP-3803 has green hair with a purple cap that is worn at all times. It sports a gold chain as an accessory and wears a jade earring on its left ear. The creature always wears a medical mask over its mouth, which may be a result of an unnatural respiratory system.

SCP-3803 displays a personality that is nurturing and caring. This aspect of its personality can lead it to behave as a parent to its friends and family members, albeit in a humorous way. SCP-3803 has expressed concern for other SCPs and even for Foundation staff, which could indicate an inclination for empathy and compassion.

Addendum 3803-1: SCP-3803 has demonstrated an ability to communicate telepathically with other animals in the area. These communications have been observed to cause uncomfortable reactions amongst human subjects nearby, leading to reports of strange auditory phenomena. Further investigation is required to understand the nature of these abilities and how they can be used in containment procedures.
