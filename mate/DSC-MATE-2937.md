Item #: 2937

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2937 is to be kept under 24-hour surveillance in a specially constructed enclosure at Site-██. All interactions with 2937 must be conducted through a secure window and via remote communication to avoid any potential harm.

Description: Subject 2937 is a male tiger of the Bengal subspecies. What appears to be a police cap is affixed to the top of its head, and it wears a gold earring in its right ear. Its facial features are unusual, with a frightened mouth and piercing red clown eyes that add to its intimidating presence.

Further examination of 2937 reveals its unusual attachment to inanimate objects. It displays a caring and nurturing personality that extends to vehicles, plants, and even household appliances. It appears to anthropomorphize these objects based on the amount of care it delivers.

According to monitored communication, the subject insists on communicating with its possessions using nicknames, having conversations, and even assigning them personality traits. While this behavior seems harmless, it may lead to deviations in 2937's mental stability.

Addendum: In a recent interview, 2937 stated that it had recently taken up a new occupation as a reporter. It is unclear how the subject gained the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish this job, but it may suggest higher intelligence than initially assessed.

Due to its unpredictable nature, all personnel interacting with 2937 must receive clearance from the Site-██ Security Coordinator.
