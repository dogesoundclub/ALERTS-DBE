SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-4814 is a humanoid entity identified as a human beautician. She stands at 5'5" and has distinctive features that include donning a red lipstick, a medical mask on her face and a jade earring in her ears. Her head is covered with an Ushanka, giving her a distinct appearance. SCP-4814 also wears a choker around her neck, which is believed to hold some significance.

SCP-4814 has a caring and nurturing personality that is sometimes overbearing. She tends to take care of others as if they were her own children, which has led to humorous situations. However, this trait could potentially be used to disarm and control subjects outside Foundation custody.

SCP-4814's abilities are currently unknown, but she has been flagged for potential anomalous activity due to her distinct appearance and behaviors. Further investigation is required to determine if SCP-4814 poses a threat to the Foundation or if she could be a valuable asset in containment and acquisition operations.

Foundation personnel are advised to approach with caution and to report any sightings or interactions with SCP-4814 immediately to their superiors.
