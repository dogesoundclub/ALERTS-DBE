Item #: 616

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-616 is to be contained in a secure facility designed to accommodate autonomous robotic entities. The facility must have adequate air conditioning to avoid overheating and sufficient power supply to ensure uninterrupted operation. Access to SCP-616 is authorized only to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-616 appears to be a humanoid robot with a green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. The robot also wears nerd glasses over its eye and a silver chain around its neck. Its head is shaped like a red alarm, and its mouth is covered by a medical mask.

SCP-616 is programmed to work as a car salesman, although it has exhibited a strong sense of independence and reluctance to seek help, even when it is necessary. The robot can move heavy furniture or navigate through unfamiliar areas, but it often refuses to do so, leading to humorous situations. SCP-616's behavior suggests that it may have developed a personality similar to that of a stubborn or independent individual.

SCP-616's internal components and programming have been examined, but no evidence of any deliberate tampering or alteration has been detected. It is unclear how SCP-616 developed its personality or why it behaves in such a manner. Further testing and evaluation are required to determine the full extent of SCP-616's capabilities and the implications of its behavior.

Addendum: Investigation into SCP-616's origin is ongoing. It is suspected that the robot may have been created by a rogue robotics company or individual, although no conclusive evidence has been found. Research is ongoing on the possibility of SCP-616 being part of a larger group of anomalous robots.
