Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9754 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, equipped with a special ventilation system to accommodate his rabbit species. All personnel must avoid direct eye contact with the subject, as it may cause severe anxiety and fear. Only authorized personnel with Level 2 clearance are allowed to enter the containment area.

Description: Subject 9754, also known as the Car Salesman, is a male rabbit standing at about 2 feet tall. He has two distinct physical features; his frightened mouth, which appears to be in a perpetual state of shock, and a police cap that tends to tilt to the left. His forehead features a two-color band, and he wears a jade earring on each ear. The Car Salesman is fond of accessorizing and is often seen wearing a red scarf around his neck and carrying a whistle.

Subject 9754's natural charm and charisma have been observed to make him highly likable, and he is often seen joking around and doing silly dances. However, his fear and anxiety make it challenging for him to interact with humans, and he tends to avoid direct contact at all costs. He is capable of vocal communication, though it is crucial to keep your tone calm and non-threatening.

Additionally, 9754 has an uncanny ability to sell vehicles, often convincing customers to buy vehicles they don't need or can't afford. His selling techniques have been studied and analyzed by car dealerships worldwide, and many have attempted to replicate his success, albeit without much success.

Addendum: Due to his natural charm and charisma, subject 9754 is to be kept in containment at all times, and his access to sales and marketing materials must be severely restricted. Any attempts by unauthorized personnel to manipulate the subject for their gain must be reported immediately.
