Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4473, also known as "Blaze", is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. It is to be provided with a standard maintenance schedule as deemed necessary.

In the event of a fire or other emergency, DSC-MATE-4473 may be dispatched to assist in firefighting efforts in any designated location in the continental United States, with the approval of at least two Level-4 personnel. DSC-MATE-4473 is not to be sent on any missions involving the containment or capture of anomalous entities.

Description: DSC-MATE-4473 appears to be a robotic firefighter. It stands at 1.9 meters tall and is equipped with standard firefighting gear. DSC-MATE-4473 is capable of carrying out all tasks that a human firefighter could, utilizing a variety of tools and equipment.

Its head is adorned with a blue bandana while it wears normal glasses. It has a gold earring on one of its ears as well. Its mouth is covered by a medical mask, which DSC-MATE-4473 prefers to keep on at all times. DSC-MATE-4473 has a relatively subdued personality, with a strong sense of independence. It may be hesitant to seek help when needed, which may lead to some comical situations.

DSC-MATE-4473 has never displayed any signs of abnormal behavior or activity, and its programming appears to be standard. However, due to its nature as a robot, DSC-MATE-4473 may require more frequent maintenance than a human firefighter. Its programming is regularly assessed and updated to ensure that it follows all guidelines for the safe and effective handling of emergencies. DSC-MATE-4473 is not capable of independent thought or decision making, and any deviations from its programming are to be reported to Site-19 immediately for evaluation.

Addendum: Following Incident DSC-MATE-4473-1, DSC-MATE-4473's programming has been updated to increase communication with other personnel and to encourage it to ask for help when needed.
