Item #: 5642

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5642, also known as the "Tiger Boss", must be contained and monitored at all times in a reinforced steel cage. Any interaction with subject 5642 should be authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel. Feeding must be provided daily with fresh raw meat. Any inappropriate behavior is to be reported immediately to the site director.

Description: Subject 5642 appears to be a fully grown male tiger with a frightened expression on his face. The tiger has jade LED eyes that can track objects up to 100 meters away. The tiger is often seen donning a police cap and a red cross earring on his ears. Its mouth is always covered with a medical mask that hides its sharp fangs. The tiger is usually spotted wearing a red scarf as an accessory.

Behavior: Subject 5642 appears to have a scatterbrained personality and often forgets important appointments or gets lost while trying to find new places. However, it is noted that the tiger possesses remarkable strength and intelligence. The tiger is known to be a mafia boss, controlling the underground criminal activities of the city's alleys.

Despite his scattered temperament, the Tiger Boss is well-respected within the criminal underground, feared for his cunning, and loved for his compassion.

No one has dared to disrupt his business dealings for fear of retaliation, and all deals are conducted using the Tiger Boss's signature red scarf as a symbol of trust.

Due to his status in the city's underground, the Foundation has deemed the Tiger Boss as Euclid and susceptible to termination should he pose a risk to humanity.

As of yet, Subject 5642 has been deemed a low-level threat and has provided valuable information about the city's criminal underworld. As such, the Tiger Boss will continue to be monitored in his current containment unit.
