Subject 5464, codenamed "The Electric Witch", is a female human of average height and build. She sports short, black hair that seems to have been styled with a charm, as it retains its shape even in the strongest wind gusts. Her striking orange eyebrows hover above eyes that gleam with a cunning intelligence, while a pair of comely jade earrings grace her lobes.

The most notable feature of 5464's witch-like appearance is the ornate two-color band that circles her head, marking her as a practitioner of the arcane arts. Perhaps in defiance of her mystical heritage, she tokes on a cancer stick, exhaling smoke through her lips in mocking defiance.

This subject's personality is a mix of harmony and goofiness. She celebrates social connections, and seeks to foster positive relationships with individuals and groups alike. However, she also has a streak of unconventional humor that has been known to bewilder and befuddle, leading to unexpected and entertaining scenarios.

Subject 5464 is proficient in the field of electrical workings, and has been employed as an electrician for some time. It is believed that she integrates her mystical knowledge into her work, imbuing her electrical systems with a subtle, esoteric power. 

As with all SCP Foundation subjects, caution and observation are advised around subject 5464. Her arcane abilities could pose a danger to both the subject and those around her if mishandled.
