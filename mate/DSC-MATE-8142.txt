Item #: SCP-8142

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8142 is to be monitored at all times by surveillance cameras installed in their workplace. Any deviations from their scheduled duties or suspicious activities should be reported immediately to the Site Director.

SCP-8142's access to sensitive or confidential information related to the Foundation is to be strictly limited.

In case of a containment breach, SCP-8142 is to be considered dangerous and unpredictable. All personnel are advised to maintain a safe distance and act with caution.

Description:

SCP-8142 is a human male in his early 30s, identified as a traffic officer working for the local government in [REDACTED], USA. SCP-8142 displays several anomalous features, including a mouth spot that glows in the dark under certain conditions, a permanent smile on their face, and peculiar purple metal protrusions growing from their scalp.

SCP-8142 also wears a pair of nerd glasses and a medical mask covering their mouth. On their forehead, SCP-8142 sports a pair of goggles, and a jade earring on their left ear. They often wear a red scarf around their neck as well.

SCP-8142's most notable anomaly is their rebellious personality and strong sense of independence. They've been known to disregard rules and protocols that they perceive as unnecessary, leading to disciplinary actions from their superiors.

SCP-8142 has expressed great interest in the paranormal and the occult, often attending local conventions and events related to these topics. However, they've shown no signs of hostility towards the Foundation or any anomalous entities under our custody.

Addendum:

SCP-8142 was detained by the Foundation after a vehicle collision incident where they displayed unusual strength and resilience. Their anomalous features were discovered during routine questioning, and SCP-8142 was subsequently taken into Foundation custody.

After being interviewed by several Level 3 personnel, SCP-8142 agreed to cooperate with the Foundation and adhere to our protocols. Their cooperation has been instrumental in preventing several potential containment breaches and containing a developing reality-bending anomaly.

SCP-8142's anomalous properties are currently under research, and their potential usefulness for the Foundation is being evaluated.
