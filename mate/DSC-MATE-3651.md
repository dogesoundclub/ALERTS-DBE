Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3651 is to be contained in a furnished room with basic amenities, including suitable food, clean water, and toys to reduce stress.

Description: DSC-MATE-3651 is a male rabbit with an unusual appearance. DSC-MATE-3651 has ski goggle eyes with a bucket hat on its head. Enhancing the peculiarity of its appearance is an LED gas mask that illuminates when DSC-MATE-3651 is under stress or fear. DSC-MATE-3651 displays a high level of intelligence compared to regular rabbits.

Personality: DSC-MATE-3651 has a playful and mischievous personality. It can be a bit reckless sometimes and tends to act before it thinks things through. This trait often leads to DSC-MATE-3651 getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to show off or impress others. Despite this, DSC-MATE-3651 is well-behaved and cooperative with handlers. DSC-MATE-3651 shows higher intelligence than what is typical for rabbits but, so far, the Foundation has not found any anomalies in its cognitive abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3651 was discovered after several reports of a traffic officer directing traffic with unusual apparel in downtown █████████. MTF responded and identified DSC-MATE-3651, appearing to be performing its designated job correctly, but with added flairs. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-3651 showed no anomalous behavior and seemed to be an ordinary, albeit uniquely attired, rabbit. Accordingly, the Foundation initiated containment of DSC-MATE-3651. As of writing this report, DSC-MATE-3651 has been in Foundation custody for █ years without incident.
