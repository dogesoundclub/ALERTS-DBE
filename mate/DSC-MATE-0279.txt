Item #: 279

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 279 is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times while on duty as a train driver. Any unusual behavior or activity must be immediately reported to the Site Director. Subject 279 is not to be allowed access to any anomalous artifacts or information related to the occult, as it may compromise the integrity of the containment procedures.

Description: Subject 279 is a male human with unique physical features that set him apart from ordinary individuals. He possesses bright red clown eyes that are believed to enhance his vision in low-light conditions. His green layered head may appear abnormal to the untrained eye, but it is a natural mutation that does not pose a threat to human life. Subject 279 is also noted for his golden earring, which is believed to hold sentimental value, and a golden chain around his neck. He is often seen carrying a candy stick as his preferred accessory, which serves as his stress reliever.

Subject 279's striking appearance may be the reason why he has an affinity for adventure and taking risks. He has shared some of his funniest stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping, and accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. His love for trying new things can make him unpredictable and challenging to work with at times, but it also makes him an excellent asset for the Foundation.

Addendum 279-A: Incident Report

On 02/14/2021, while on duty as a train driver, Subject 279 encountered an anomalous creature that had breached containment en route to Site-██. The creature had the ability to manipulate reality and disrupt technology, leading to the crash of several trains on the line. Subject 279 demonstrated exceptional bravery and managed to shield himself and several passengers from the creature's attacks. He was later praised for his quick thinking and valor in the face of danger.

Following this incident, Subject 279's clearance level was upgraded, and he was fitted with a specialized amulet that would provide protection against reality-bending anomalies. Further research is underway to determine whether Subject 279's unique physical traits can prove useful in the containment of other SCPs.
