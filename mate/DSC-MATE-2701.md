Item #: DSC-MATE-2701

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2701 is to be housed at Site-███ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. DSC-MATE-2701's cage must be equipped with a solid metal door and a secure lock. In addition, all personnel must wear level 4 hazmat suits when entering the containment chamber of DSC-MATE-2701 due to its hostile behavior towards exposed flesh. Access to DSC-MATE-2701's chamber can only be given by Level 4 personnel or higher, and all contact with DSC-MATE-2701 is forbidden.

Description: DSC-MATE-2701 appears to be a humanoid rabbit standing approximately 3 feet tall with a blue and white fur coat. DSC-MATE-2701's eyes are protected by ski goggles and its head is covered with a headset with LED lights. DSC-MATE-2701 also wears a gas mask with a silver chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-2701's behavior is unpredictable, often displaying a lack of control over its own emotions. Its impulsive nature makes it difficult to predict its actions, leading to humorous outcomes such as spontaneously making decisions that are surprising or amusing.

DSC-MATE-2701's hostility towards exposed flesh makes it dangerous to humans, and all personnel are required to wear full level 4 hazmat suits in its presence. DSC-MATE-2701 is capable of moving at high speed and using its powerful legs to attack any exposed flesh it encounters. It has been noted that DSC-MATE-2701 is capable of reproducing through unidentified means, leading to the possibility of a colony of similar entities in the wild.

DSC-MATE-2701 was initially discovered on a remote farm in the southern United States where it was being kept by a farmer of its own species. The farmer reported that DSC-MATE-2701 exhibited unpredictable behavior and was difficult to control. After a containment breach, DSC-MATE-2701 was captured by Foundation personnel and brought back to Site-███ for further investigation.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2701's impulsive behavior makes it a challenge to contain and study, but its sentient nature is of significant interest to the Foundation. Further research into DSC-MATE-2701's reproductive habits is ongoing, and the possibility of a larger population of similar entities in the wild remains a concern.
