Item #: 2570

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2570 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to his tiger characteristics, DSC-MATE-2570 must be provided with ample space to move and exercise. DSC-MATE-2570 is not to be released for independent activities outside of approved testing situations. Access to DSC-MATE-2570 outside of approved testing situations is strictly prohibited without authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-2570 appears as a male tiger with a frightened mouth and red clown eyes. DSC-MATE-2570 accessorizes with a purple cap with a headset, gold earring, and a silver chain. DSC-MATE-2570 also possesses a strong sense of independence that makes it difficult for him to ask for help, even when necessary.

DSC-MATE-2570's independence often leads to humorous situations such as attempting to move a heavy piece of furniture alone or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. Despite their humorous quirks, DSC-MATE-2570 is highly skilled and knowledgeable in mechanics.

DSC-MATE-2570 was discovered when local authorities responded to reports of a tiger causing commotion in a shopping mall basement. Upon investigation, DSC-MATE-2570 was found tinkering with an elevator in an employee-only section of the mall.

DSC-MATE-2570 claims to have been a mechanic for the circus prior to containment, although this cannot be verified. DSC-MATE-2570 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel since containment, but exhibits occasional outbursts of frustration due to the limited amount of independence granted to him.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2570 has been selected for testing in the development of a new robotic system designed for repair and maintenance in hazardous areas. DSC-MATE-2570 has shown promising results in early testing phases, displaying exceptional skill and knowledge in the field of mechanics. Further testing is scheduled to begin at Site-██.
