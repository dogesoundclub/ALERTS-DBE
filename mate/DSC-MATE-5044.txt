Item #: 5044

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5044 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell should be furnished with normal amenities such as a bed, a desk, and a chair. Additionally, an air filtration system capable of filtering out airborne contaminants must be installed in the cell. SCP-5044 is allowed to have personal items in their cell, but all items must be screened and approved by two Level 3 personnel.

SCP-5044 is not allowed contact with any family members, acquaintances or any person who has insulted their loved ones. Any communication attempts from SCP-5044 aimed at communication with unapproved persons are to be monitored and recorded.

SCP-5044 is to be provided with a weekly psychological consultation session with a certified psychologist, to monitor signs of aggressive behavior and assess their overall mental state. Any person in contact with or communicating with SCP-5044 will need to be made aware of the risks involved.

Description: SCP-5044, also known as "The Delivery Driver," is a human female of approximately 35 years of age. SCP-5044 has a distinctive appearance, including two orange stripes on the cheeks, purple lips, and orange eyebrows. SCP-5044 often wears a LED gas mask accessory over their face, which they claim is because they are sensitive to pollutants and airborne contaminants. Additionally, SCP-5044 wears a silver chain accessory around their neck and has pigtails on top of their head.

SCP-5044 has displayed laid-back and easy-going behavior during their time in containment. However, SCP-5044 has also shown an intense loyalty and protectiveness towards their loved ones. In situations where a loved one is insulted or threatened, SCP-5044 can become verbally and physically aggressive. These outbursts can be unpredictable and have caused disruptions and damage to Foundation property.

It is clear that SCP-5044 is capable of causing harm either intentionally or unintentionally, and its containment is necessary for the safety of all personnel involved.

Addendum: SCP-5044 was initially detained by Foundation personnel undercover in the civil authority after being suspected of causing chaos and destruction during a public disturbance. The incident occurred after a bystander allegedly insulted a family member of SCP-5044 at a public event. SCP-5044 responded with verbal and physical aggression, leading to subsequent property damage, physical altercations, and the death of several individuals. Due to the event's scale, the Foundation became involved, and SCP-5044 was captured and transferred to Site-██.
