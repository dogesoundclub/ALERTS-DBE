Addendum: Incident Report 4200-A

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4200 showed anomalous behavior during a routine court hearing. DSC-MATE-4200 became fixated on the defendant's shirt pattern, repeatedly claiming that it did not match the alleged crime. This behavior persisted despite evidence to the contrary.

Foundation agents intervened and escorted DSC-MATE-4200 from the courtroom. In further examination, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-4200's cybernetic eyes had malfunctioned and caused a discrepancy in her perception of the defendant's clothing. The eyes were repaired, and DSC-MATE-4200 exhibited no further anomalous behavior.

Further precautions have been put in place to monitor DSC-MATE-4200's cybernetic enhancements.
