SCP-4449 is a male rabbit, identified by the Foundation as a News Anchor. Anomalous features include a Doge Hat atop its head, an identifying Red Victory Band on its forehead, and a single Gold Earring adorning each of its long ears. SCP-4449 exhibits a strong sense of independence and individuality, often refusing to conform to authority or submit to arbitrary rules. This nature manifests as insubordinate tendencies, such as departing the workstation early or absconding without prior approval. Site personnel are advised to monitor the activity of SCP-4449 closely and maintain strict regulation of its behavior in accordance with Foundation protocol.
