Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5549 is to be allowed to continue work as a fast food worker, with regular check-ins by Foundation agents to monitor any anomalous activity. DSC-MATE-5549 is not to be allowed access to any tools or materials that could be used for repairing or building objects.

Description: DSC-MATE-5549 appears to be a human female with orange eyebrows and pigtails. She wears a gold chain and a red cross earring in her ears. While her appearance is not abnormal, her personality has been observed to include a tendency to fix things in unconventional ways. This may include the use of duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects or the creation of makeshift solutions to complex problems.

Though seemingly harmless, DSC-MATE-5549's abilities have shown to be anomalous in nature. Attempts to study her methods have been unsuccessful, as she seems to possess an innate understanding of how to repair or construct objects. Furthermore, her use of unconventional methods often results in successful repairs or solutions, defying traditional engineering principles.

DSC-MATE-5549 is currently not aware of her anomalous abilities, and it is advised to keep it that way to avoid any accidental activation of said abilities. Any further experimentation on DSC-MATE-5549 is to be approved by level 3 personnel or higher.
