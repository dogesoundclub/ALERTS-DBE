Item #: SCP-6106

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6106 is to remain under constant surveillance by Foundation agents posing as members of the public. Any reports of abnormal behavior or use of anomalous abilities are to be reported to the nearest Foundation office immediately. Under no circumstances should SCP-6106 be allowed to hold public office or influence national politics.

Description: SCP-6106 is a humanoid entity identified as female and is recognized as a successful politician. SCP-6106 displays a wide range of behaviors, but is most often observed as being energetic and enthusiastic. SCP-6106 is characterized by the presence of various spots on her face and has bright orange eyebrow eyes. They are often seen wearing a hoodie with a gold chain around their neck, and are frequently observed smoking cigarettes.

SCP-6106 has demonstrated a propensity to influence others through their personality, particularly when it comes to rousing others to excitement. Subjects interacting with SCP-6106 may find themselves caught up in their energy and enthusiasm, leading to humorously awkward situations where they become overly excited about topics of little interest to those around them.

SCP-6106 has also shown an ability to use suggestive persuasion to achieve their goals. This ability appears to operate subconsciously and is not under SCP-6106's conscious control. SCP-6106 has been observed using this ability to further her political agenda, causing tension within the Foundation as to the extent of their future involvement in political matters.

Addendum: Testing was carried out to determine the full extent of SCP-6106's anomalous abilities. Results show that SCP-6106 has the ability to charm and influence individuals, making them more susceptible to suggestion. It was also revealed that SCP-6106's anomaly appears to be strengthening over time, with little indication as to when or where it will peak. As such, the decision has been made to contain SCP-6106 for the foreseeable future.
