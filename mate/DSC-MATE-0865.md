Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-865 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished adequately with medical equipment and supplies. DSC-MATE-865 is not to be allowed to leave his containment for any reason other than medical emergencies.

Description: DSC-MATE-865 is a human male who works as a doctor. He displays an unusual collection of physical characteristics, including a medical mask always covering his mouth, a peak spike protruding from his head, and VR jade LED eyes.

DSC-MATE-865 also presents a gold earring on each ear and a red scarf around his neck as accessories. These features, combined with his frightened mouth expression, make him appear unnerving to some people.

DSC-MATE-865 shows signs of having a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. This often leads to DSC-MATE-865 trying to solve problems by himself, even when he requires assistance. This stubbornness can cause humorous situations but has shown to cause complications in emergency situations.

DSC-MATE-865's medical expertise is above average, with particular skill in surgical procedures. DSC-MATE-865 has been willing to use his skill for the Foundation's benefit in the past.

Addendum: During medical procedures, DSC-MATE-865 has been observed to become unusually focused, to the point of ignoring anything not directly related to the task at hand. While this is a desirable trait for a surgeon, it is concerning when attempting to interact with DSC-MATE-865 in non-medical situations.
