Item #: 1576

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-1576 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. Standard protocols for human detainment should be followed- regular meals, medical checkups, and access to entertainment media of their choice.

SCP-1576 is permitted to keep a single cigarette on their person at all times, which will be checked on a daily basis. Smoking is only permitted in designated areas with proper ventilation.

SCP-1576 is permitted visitors, but all visitors must be cleared by Site-17 security and accompanied by at least one Level 2 staff member.

Description:

SCP-1576 is a male human, in their late twenties or early thirties, standing 1.8 meters (5'11'') tall and weighing approximately 84 kg (185 lbs).

SCP-1576's most distinctive feature is a small spot on their lips. Additionally, the corners of their mouth sag to the point that it appears as if SCP-1576 is frightened, even when relaxed.

SCP-1576 wears corrective glasses and has a short hairstyle with a central spike that forms a peak at the top of the scalp.

SCP-1576 is a police officer by occupation, and records indicate a history of commendations for bravery and quick thinking.

SCP-1576's primary distinguishing trait is their loyal and protective nature. Although they may appear laid-back and easy-going, when threatened, SCP-1576 will become highly defensive of loved ones, even to the point of verbal argument or physical confrontation.

Addendum:

SCP-1576 was apprehended by Foundation agents following reports of abnormal behavior during a routine traffic stop. After a brief investigation, SCP-1576 was found to have unknowingly interacted with an anomalous object which had caused the mouth spot and frightened mouth to appear.

Further testing revealed no other anomalous properties. SCP-1576 was subsequently recruited as a member of the Foundation's police force, using their knowledge and skills to investigate and contain anomalous entities that might otherwise evade the law.
