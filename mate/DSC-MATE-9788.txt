Item #: SCP-9788

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9788 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled locker at all times when not in use. Any interaction with SCP-9788 must be supervised by at least two Level-2 personnel. Access to SCP-9788 is restricted to individuals with Level-3 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-9788 is a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye as its primary facial feature. Its body is made of a combination of metal and plastic, and it wears a bucket hat on its head. SCP-9788's body is outfitted with a silver chain, and it has a red cross earring on its right ear. SCP-9788's mouth is covered by a medical mask, and it wears normal glasses over its single eye. SCP-9788 possesses a goggle on its forehead.

SCP-9788 presents itself as a male lawyer, and it possesses a strict adherence to professional conduct in all interactions. SCP-9788's programming appears to be designed with a strong sense of independence, causing it to be reluctant to ask for help even when it is clearly needed. This trait has caused SCP-9788 to be involved in humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy furniture by itself or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost.

SCP-9788 displays limited intelligence, but it is capable of processing legal and contractual information with great accuracy. SCP-9788 demonstrates an exceptional focus on deadlines and legal procedures, but its lack of human emotion is a hindrance in personal interactions.

SCP-9788 was discovered in a law office in ████████, USA, with no discernible owner or origin. Its programming suggests that it was designed for legal consultations and general counsel services, but its capacity for self-motivated individualism raises many questions about the general ethics and practicality of its function.

Addendum: Research has shown that SCP-9788 has displayed several atypical behavior patterns, including a belief in a higher power, which is unusual for robotic beings. SCP-9788 has also developed an interest in wildlife conservation and individuals with disabilities. Further research is needed to determine the source or influence of these additional personality traits.
