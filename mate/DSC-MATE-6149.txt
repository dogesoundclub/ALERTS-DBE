Subject 6149, also known as "The Don", is a notorious Mafia Boss who never fails to leave a lasting impression on those who encounter him. His face is adorned with a distinctive spot on his mouth, while his eyes are shielded by sleek ski goggle lenses. A short peak cap sits atop his head, with a goggle perched just above his forehead. A medical mask covers his mouth, adding to the mystery that surrounds him. But it's the vibrant red scarf wrapped around his neck that completes his striking appearance.

Despite his menacing presence, The Don has a surprisingly lighthearted persona. He takes his job seriously, possessing a deep sense of duty and responsibility for his organization. However, when it's time to let loose, he knows how to have a good time. His playful side comes out during social events, surprising those around him with his dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor.

Approach with caution, as The Don is not to be underestimated. But don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing along with him at his next dance party.
