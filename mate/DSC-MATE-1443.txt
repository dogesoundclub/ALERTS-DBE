Item #: 1443

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and access to any electronic devices should be heavily restricted. All interactions should be monitored through a soundproofed chamber as the subject has exhibited potent psychic abilities that should not be taken lightly.

Description: Subject 1443 is a human male with distinct orange stripes on his face and a perpetual smile. The eyes appear to be ski goggles affixed securely on his face, and his head, which appears to be metal, exhibits shades of purple. The subject has been known to wear a gold chain, which seems to be an essential accessory. Additionally, the subject is always seen wearing a normal gas mask.

The subject has displayed heightened instincts, bordering on extrasensory perception, which can come across as eerie or unsettling. He has the uncanny ability to anticipate events before they occur, which makes him both an asset and a risk. The subject's powers of perception also enable him to decipher when someone is feeling anxious or upset, allowing them to handle such situations with ease.

Given the subject's ability, great care must be taken when interacting with him as his psychic abilities can easily destabilize the mental state of those around him. As a result, the subject must be kept under strict surveillance and monitored at all times.

Conclusion: As with all Euclid-graded SCPs, caution must be exercised when dealing with the subject. His potent abilities, coupled with his ability to sense emotional disturbances, make him a powerful tool for the foundation. However, his power must not be mishandled as it could easily spin out of control.
