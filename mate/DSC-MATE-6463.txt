SCP-6463, also known as "The Farmer", is a humanoid anomaly of the human species. The entity is male and typically appears wearing a purple cap with a headset, nerdy glasses over his eyes, and a medical mask over his mouth. Noteworthy about this anomalous individual is the silver chain accessory frequently seen around his neck.

SCP-6463 has been observed to possess a distinct and dry sense of humor, causing others to underestimate or be taken aback by this facet of its personality. The entity has a unique talent for delivering deadpan jokes in a manner that is surprisingly entertaining for those around it, challenging their expectations of it being a humorless "farmer." SCP-6463 demonstrates a knack for disarming tense situations with its wit, making it a valuable asset in conflict resolution scenarios. 

Outwardly, SCP-6463 appears unassuming, but it is not to be underestimated. Its unassuming facade hides depths of personality and power that may be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Handle with caution.
