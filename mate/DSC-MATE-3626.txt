Item #: SCP-3626

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3626 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The room is to be furnished with basic amenities and may contain items such as books, music players, and puzzles for enrichment purposes. No mirrors, reflective surfaces or objects capable of creating a reflection are to be brought within a 20-meter radius of SCP-3626's containment chamber. Handle with care and use of tranquilizer darts are to be employed if any attempts to use SCP-3626 for anomalous banking activities are detected.

Description: SCP-3626 appears to be a male monkey of an unknown species. It stands approximately 1 meter tall and is adorned with a retro cap. SCP-3626 has reflective ski goggles for eyes and a frightened mouth. It wears a normal gas mask as an accessory.

SCP-3626 exhibits a tendency to act recklessly and has a tendency to act before thinking things through. This leads to humorous situations such as minor accidents or mishaps while trying to impress others. SCP-3626 has a keen interest in banking and has attempted to engage in anomalous banking activities.

SCP-3626 is capable of manipulating both non-anomalous and anomalous monetary systems. SCP-3626 has demonstrated an ability to create and dissolve bank accounts at will, manipulate electronic locking systems, and memorize significant amounts of information in short amounts of time.

SCP-3626 is also capable of altering the perception of those it interacts with, causing them to unknowingly engage in questionable banking activities. SCP-3626 has no known limits to this ability and may be able to influence individuals to commit illegal acts while under its influence.

SCP-3626 is to be handled with care and monitored closely by personnel authorized to handle anomalous monetary systems. Any attempts by SCP-3626 to initiate anomalous banking activities are to be immediately terminated, and all anomalous transactions tracked and logged for research and analysis purposes.
