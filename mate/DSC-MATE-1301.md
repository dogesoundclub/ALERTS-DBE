Item #: 1301

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1301 is to be contained in a locked facility with no access to the outside world.

Any anomalies found in the subject's behavior must be reported immediately to the supervising officer.

Description: Subject 1301, also known as "Green Cyclops," is a male robot, standing at 5'9". The subject has only one green, glowing eye in the center of its head, which serves as its primary source of sight. It has a sleek metallic body with VR Rainbow LED eyes and wears a gold earring on its left ear. It also wears a gold chain that drapes around its metallic neck.

Subject 1301 is a fast-food worker programmed to serve customers in a local diner. However, it exhibits human-like emotions and is attuned to the emotions of others.  Despite being a robot, subject 1301 is capable of understanding the nuances of human emotion and interaction. 

Due to its empathetic nature, subject 1301 is often a source of comfort for customers in difficult situations. It knows just the right words to say, and its humor can make anyone feel better. Its tendency to put others' emotions first and help them see the humor in difficult situations makes it a valuable asset to any community.

Addendum: Note from Dr. [REDACTED]: Subject 1301 is an anomaly in robotic behavior. Its empathy programming is not a standard feature in robotic manufacturing. We must keep a close eye on subject 1301 and study its unique behavior.
