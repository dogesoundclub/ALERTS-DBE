Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 6554, also known as the Theater Manager, must be contained within a designated urban area. Under no circumstances should he be allowed to roam freely in public. Any attempts to detain or restrict the subject must be done with care, as his jovial nature can quickly turn sour if he feels threatened or confined.

Description: The Theater Manager is a Human male with a distinctive Mouth Spot located just below his bottom lip. His smile is infectious and has been known to disarm even the most hostile individuals. The subject is rarely seen without his trademark blue bandana wrapped around his head, which serves to partially conceal his beady eyes.

A pair of goggles is consistently found resting on the subject's forehead, which he often wears as a fashion statement rather than for practical use. His ears boast a single gold earring, and around his neck can be seen a thick gold chain.

Personality: The Theater Manager is a charismatic individual with a great sense of humor. He delights in telling funny stories and doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. His natural charm allows him to easily win over people, and he is often sought after for social gatherings.

However, his affable nature can be deceptive. The subject has been known to use his charm to manipulate others to his own end. He has been involved in several incidents where he has used his skills to deceive and harm unsuspecting individuals. As such, caution must be exercised when dealing with the Theater Manager.

Addendum: It is believed that the Theater Manager possesses certain anomalous properties that have yet to be fully understood. Further testing is required to establish the extent of his abilities.
