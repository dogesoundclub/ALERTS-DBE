Item #: SCP-5366

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5366 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with suitable modifications for a large feline predator, including a reinforced steel door and special air filtration systems. Access to SCP-5366 is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel with proper clearance.

Description: SCP-5366 appears to resemble a Bengal tiger with notable fashion accessories such as a blue bandana and a red cross earring. Its frightened mouth and nerd glasses give the impression of an anxious and intelligent individual. SCP-5366 is noted for its rebellious behavior, often finding ways to bend or outright break containment procedures. Despite this, SCP-5366 is a skilled mechanic and enjoys using its abilities to repair and maintain mechanical objects within its containment chamber.

Personality: SCP-5366's rebellious and rule-breaking tendencies are a notable aspect of its personality. It has been observed purposely breaking rules or finding ways to bend them just to see what happens. These acts can often lead to humorous situations, but it is important to note that SCP-5366 is a dangerous predator and should not be underestimated. SCP-5366 also exhibits a particular fondness for gold chains, which it wears around its neck.

Addendum: Incident Log - On ██/██/████, SCP-5366 managed to escape its containment cell using a mechanical fail-safe it had installed in secret. SCP-5366 proceeded to cause extensive damage to Site-██, resulting in several casualties before being recaptured by security personnel. SCP-5366 has been punished accordingly and its containment procedures have been revised to prevent future escapes.
