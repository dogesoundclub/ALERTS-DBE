Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be monitored via standard surveillance equipment, and all sightings are to be reported to the Foundation immediately. SCP-XXXX is currently being held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a small outdoor area for exercise. The chamber is to be kept clean and stocked with appropriate food for the SCP-XXXX's species. SCP-XXXX is to be provided appropriate clothing and accessories for its job as a traffic officer.

Description: SCP-XXXX is a male monkey, standing approximately 1 meter tall, weighing 25 kg. It is identified as a traffic officer, wearing a purple cap with a headset, normal glasses over its eyes, a gold earring on its right ear, a gold chain around its neck, and a whistle hanging from its neck. SCP-XXXX speaks in a surprisingly clear voice and has demonstrated exceptional intelligence, able to read and understand human languages, and use basic communication tools.

SCP-XXXX displays a strong sense of independence and is often reluctant to ask for help, even when it requires assistance. This tendency leads to humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy loads or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. SCP-XXXX has demonstrated a confident and charismatic personality, often solving problems with quick-thinking and inventiveness. It maintains a professional demeanor while performing its duties as a traffic officer.

Addendum: SCP-XXXX was discovered when reports of a talking monkey directing traffic in ████, Ohio, caught the Foundation's eye. Foundation agents were able to successfully detain SCP-XXXX without incident. Interviews with SCP-XXXX revealed minimal information about its origins or how it developed its intelligence. Further studies are underway to evaluate its capabilities and potential uses for the Foundation.
