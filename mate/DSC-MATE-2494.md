Interviewee: Item 2494

Dr. ████████████: Good day, Item 2494. We appreciate your cooperation with the Foundation.

Item 2494: Not a problem, happy to help any way I can.

Dr. ████████████: Understood. Can you tell me the reason behind the LED gas mask you wear, and the significance of the gold chain and earring?

Item 2494: Ah, the mask. Well, it’s just to filter out the city air. That thing gets thick, you know? And as for the gold chain and earring, it’s just a personal touch. Nothing fancy.

Dr. ████████████: Can you elaborate on how you handle problems in your everyday life?

Item 2494: I like to keep things simple. If something needs to be fixed, I’ll fix it. I don’t have time for overly complicated solutions. The problem is the enemy, not the tool.

Dr. ████████████: I see. And when presented with a significant problem, how do you react?

Item 2494: I react first, think later. Sometimes that’s a bad thing, sometimes it’s not. But in the end, the problem is usually solved, and that’s what matters.

Dr. ████████████: Understood. Thank you for your time, Item 2494.

Item 2494: No problem, doc. Anytime.
