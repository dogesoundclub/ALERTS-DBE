Item #: SCP-9127

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9127 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Proximity to other humanoids should be limited, and all interactions with SCP-9127 must be conducted through a voice modulator to prevent the spread of its anomalous effect. Only Level 3 personnel may interact with SCP-9127. Under no circumstances are they to be allowed outside of the Foundation's control or allowed to come into contact with "normal" individuals.

Description: SCP-9127 is a human male, with a unique appearance that separates it from other members of its species. The most notable trait of SCP-9127 is the VR Rainbow LED eyes that constantly emit multicolored lights. It has spots on its face and a smile on its lips, giving it a friendly, approachable appearance. SCP-9127 prefers to wear a blue bandana around its head, and a jade earring in one of its ears. It also adorns a golden chain and carries a candy stick at all times.

SCP-9127's anomalous effect revolves around its strong sense of empathy. It can feel and understand the emotions of others by simply being in the same room as them. SCP-9127 is often very attuned to the emotions of others, and this can lead to humorous situations, as it knows just the right thing to say to make someone feel better or help others see the humor in a tough situation. It also has the innate ability to calm people down and make them feel comfortable in its presence.

SCP-9127 works as a real estate agent, using its abilities to make deals with clients and gain their trust. All transactions performed by SCP-9127 have been found to be legitimate and legal, but further monitoring is required to ensure that it does not use its abilities to unduly influence clients. SCP-9127 has shown no signs of hostility or aggression towards Foundation personnel, and is generally cooperative during containment protocols.

Addendum: SCP-9127 has demonstrated the ability to influence the emotions of nearby individuals beyond its normal range of effect when it sings or plays music. Testing is ongoing to determine the extent of this ability and any potential amplification.
