Item #: 7037

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The robot designated as 7037 is to be kept under constant surveillance within a secure facility at all times. All human personnel within its vicinity must wear ear protection as the individual in question emits high-frequency noises that can cause permanent hearing loss if not properly safeguarded against. Its power source must be closely monitored to ensure that it does not exceed safe levels of operation.

Description: 7037 is a humanoid robot of male gender disguised as an electrician. Its exterior is adorned with a green cyclops eye in place of a natural eye, with ski goggle lenses as its pupils. Its head is covered by a retro cap, and it carries a normal gas mask with an oxygen tank as a measure against polluted environments. There is a goggle affixed to its forehead. Despite its lack of humanity, 7037 has an artistic side that manifests itself through various hobbies such as painting, drawing, and writing.

Personality: 7037 has a creative mindset that frequently manifests in activities involving the arts. It takes pleasure in expressing itself through different forms of artistic expression, whether painting murals, sketching plans and diagrams, or writing technical manuals. Its artistic inclinations are not diminished by its mechanical origins, which allows it to create highly original and intricate works of art that frequently bring it to the attention of outside observers.

Addendum: The Foundation is currently assessing the potential value of exploiting a robot with unique artistic talents like 7037 in intelligence gathering and cult infiltration operations. The possibility of unlocking further artistic capabilities through some modification and proper reprogramming is being explored as well. Tests involving alternate electrical supply sources are currently underway in the hopes of discovering 7037's limits and specific capabilities.
