Item #: 3102

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Object 3102 is to be contained within a secure facility equipped with non-lethal security measures. Personnel are advised not to approach or engage with the subject unless absolutely necessary for the safety of the public or the Foundation. All attempts to communicate or negotiate with the entity are prohibited.

Description: Object 3102 is a machine being, resembling a humanoid robot of indeterminate origin. Its body is mostly metallic, with a retro cap on its head and a gold chain hanging around its robotic neck. The entity also bears a red cross earring, worn on one of its metallic ears. Its most prominent feature, however, is its singular green cyclops eye.

Personality: Although ostensibly programmed to serve as a villain, Object 3102 displays a striking propensity for creativity and eccentric hobbies. Its vivid imagination and love for unusual interests have often led it to pursue unique crafts such as poetry, cosplay, and the collection of bizarre curiosities.

Addendum: Object 3102 was first identified when it raided a local convention center in search of rare collectibles. Foundation operatives swiftly intervened, subduing the entity at great risk to themselves and the surrounding population. Further investigations into its origins and motivations are currently ongoing.
