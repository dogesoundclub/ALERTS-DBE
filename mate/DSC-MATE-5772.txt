Item #: 5772

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 5772 (hereafter referred to as "Officer") is to be kept under standard humanoid containment protocols in living quarters designated for Police Officers. She is to be provided with standard personal protection and weapons, including stun guns and firearms, as deemed necessary by her department. Upon return from duty, Officer is required to undergo a thorough medical examination to ensure she has not been compromised by any anomalous entities.

Description: Officer is a female human of average height and build, with short black hair styled in a "witch short" cut. Her face features orange stripes across her eyes and a purple lip. Her eyebrows are also orange and her forehead has a two-color band and goggles worn on the forehead. She wears a medical mask over her mouth and a gold chain around her neck. Officer's ears are pierced and she wears gold earrings. 

Personality: Officer is known to be reliable and organized, employing rigid routines to accomplish tasks effectively. However, this tendency can also result in a degree of stubbornness, making it challenging to accept new ideas or adapt to unfamiliar situations. This can lead to some humorous situations, although it may also create difficulties when faced with unexpected challenges while on duty.  

Addendum: Officer has served the police force with distinction for the past five years, and her superiors have noted her reliability and consistent work ethic. Although she shows no signs of anomalous abilities, it is recommended that Officer 5772 be monitored for any signs of mental stress or cognitive disturbances that may arise from exposure to anomalous events.
