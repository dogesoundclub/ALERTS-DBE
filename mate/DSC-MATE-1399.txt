Item Number: SCP-1399

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1399 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Personnel are not permitted to enter SCP-1399's cell without wearing facial protective gear. All interactions with SCP-1399 must be conducted through an intercom system located within the cell.

SCP-1399 is currently employed as a real estate agent, and must adhere to a regular schedule of work hours. SCP-1399 is permitted to maintain employment outside of the Foundation, but must report to Foundation personnel any changes to their occupation or employment location.

Description: SCP-1399 is a female human with several unique physical features. Their face is covered in numerous brown spots, which are thought to be a benign skin condition. SCP-1399 frequently wears a medical mask over their mouth and a purple cap with a headset on their head. Their eyes are blue and clown-like in appearance.

SCP-1399's most notable feature is a two-color band across their forehead, which is believed to be of unknown origin. SCP-1399 also wears a green cross earring in their left ear and a gold chain accessory.

SCP-1399 possesses a dry sense of humor that has been observed to catch people off guard. Despite not considering themselves the life of the party, SCP-1399 has a way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny. SCP-1399 has been observed to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become easily frustrated with those who do not meet their expectations.

Addendum: During routine medical examinations, it was discovered that SCP-1399 possesses anomalous properties related to their skin condition. When SCP-1399's skin is in contact with another person's skin for a prolonged period, that person begins to develop the same skin condition as SCP-1399. It is unknown if SCP-1399 is aware of their anomalous properties. Further research into this phenomenon is ongoing.
