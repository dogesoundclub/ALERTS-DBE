Description: DSC-MATE-5715 is a human female, appearing to be in her mid-20s, standing at 1.68 meters tall and weighing approximately 64 kg. DSC-MATE-5715 works as a firefighter in the local fire department and consistently displays professionalism and efficiency in carrying out her duties. However, DSC-MATE-5715 has several unusual physical traits that set her apart from an ordinary human.

DSC-MATE-5715's head appears to be completely covered in green flames, which curl and flicker as if constantly moving. Despite being in constant proximity to flames, DSC-MATE-5715 does not appear to experience any heat or pain from them. DSC-MATE-5715's eyes are notable for their bright blue color and clown-like appearance. DSC-MATE-5715's lips always appear to be painted with bright red lipstick, which never fades.

In addition to these physical traits, DSC-MATE-5715 is always seen wearing a golden hoop earring and a choker necklace. DSC-MATE-5715's personality is characterized by a mixture of organization and spontaneity. While DSC-MATE-5715 enjoys planning ahead, she has been known to surprise her colleagues with impromptu adventures and parties, which are always successful.

DSC-MATE-5715's anomalous properties become apparent when she is exposed to flames. Rather than being harmed by them, DSC-MATE-5715 displays a remarkable power over fire. DSC-MATE-5715 can manipulate flames with her mind, extinguish them instantly, and even summon them from thin air. DSC-MATE-5715's powers appear to be strongest when she is in danger or needs to protect others.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5715 was discovered during a routine fire call in downtown ██████, when DSC-MATE-5715 displayed her powers in public.

DSC-MATE-5715 remains cooperative and has expressed a willingness to assist the Foundation in any way possible. Further research is underway to understand the nature and extent of DSC-MATE-5715's anomalous abilities.
