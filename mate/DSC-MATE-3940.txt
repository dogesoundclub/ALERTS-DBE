SCP-3940, also known as "Bugs", is an anomalous rabbit creature currently working as a fast food worker in an undisclosed location. Despite his seemingly unimpressive appearance, Bugs possesses a natural charisma and a talent for leadership, which often leads him to take charge of even the most chaotic of situations.

Bugs' piercing blue clown eyes are always alert, scanning his surroundings for potential threats or opportunities. He sports a bright red beanie hat atop his head, a common accessory among his kind. However, it is his cigarette - an item not typically seen in a fast food establishment - that truly sets him apart.

Witnesses claim that Bugs' personality is infectious, drawing people in with his easy confidence and can-do attitude. He has a keen sense of humor and is quick to offer a helping hand to those in need.

Despite his friendly demeanor, it is important to note that Bugs is not to be underestimated. Reports suggest that he possesses a surprising amount of physical strength and dexterity, making him quite capable in a fight. It is unknown whether this is a natural trait of his species or a result of his anomalous abilities.

As with all SCP subjects, great care must be taken when interacting with Bugs. While he may seem harmless and approachable, one should never forget the potential danger posed by his unusual traits.
