Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9933 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and is to be monitored for any unusual or abnormal behavior. Due to his occupation, Subject 9933 is allowed to maintain his veterinary practice, but all animals within his care are to be examined and observed before being released back to their owners. Any anomalous behavior observed in animals is to be immediately reported to the Foundation for further study. Subject 9933 must wear a red scarf at all times, and is only allowed to consume candy sticks provided by Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 9933 is a human male, approximately 34 years old. He stands at 6 feet, with a slim build, and has a frightened mouth. His eyes are notably unusual, bearing resemblance to red clown eyes. Subject 9933's head is often seen adorned with a short peak cap, alongside a red scarf around his neck. He carries a candy stick at all times.

Personality: Subject 9933 is known to have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which he exercises in his role as a veterinarian. However, he is also known to let loose and have fun, often leading to humorous situations. He has been observed surprising others with his dance moves and silly antics in social events. This odd behavior is not to be tolerated in public and must be immediately ceased through a sedative. 

Additional Notes: Although Subject 9933 appears to be a relatively harmless individual, his anomalous traits could pose a potential threat to society if not kept under control. He has been observed having adverse reactions to certain stimuli, which result in a dangerous state of mind that must be monitored closely.
