Item #: 5210 
Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures:  Subject 5210 must be monitored at all times and be kept away from any political events or venues. He must reside in a secured facility within a designated urban area, and must not hold any position of power, elected or appointed. 

Description:  Subject 5210 is a human with orange stripes on his face, and blue clown eyes that appear to have an anomalous effect on anyone looking back at them- inducing a sense of vulnerability and weakness. Additionally, he wears a blue bandana around his head, along with a pair of goggles and a jade earring on his ears. He is usually seen carrying a candy stick in his hand. 

Subject 5210 is a politician, with strong tendencies towards rebellion and resistance to authority. When he sees rules or regulations as unnecessary, he may disregard them or resort to sneaky behavior such as leaving the office early or taking a day off without permission. This behavior may be influenced by an unknown entity, as his rebellion seems to be uncontrollable, even against his own will. 

Due to the anomalous properties of his eyes, Subject 5210 is considered to be a danger to anyone he comes into contact with. It is recommended that he is kept at a safe distance, and any visits to his containment facility must be cleared by designated personnel before proceeding. 

Addendum: After several incidents of unauthorized behavior, further investigation into Subject 5210 has been approved. It is recommended that any additional anomalous properties or entities involved in his actions be identified and contained immediately.
