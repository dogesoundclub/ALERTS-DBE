SCP-79, also known as "The Real Estate Agent", is a humanoid entity in the form of a female human. She maintains a professional appearance, wearing a tiara and accessorizing with a red cross earring and choker. However, her distinguishing features are her striking orange stripes that contrast with her purple lips. 

Donning normal glasses over her eyes, SCP-79 possesses a charming and charismatic demeanor that immediately attracts others. Her outgoing nature and strong sense of duty make her an exceptional real estate agent, always willing to go the extra mile for her clients. 

However, SCP-79 also knows how to have fun and does not shy away from the spotlight or the dance floor. Her proficiency in charming and livening up any situation has led to rumors that she may possess some form of mind-manipulating abilities. But no evidence of this has been found in her so far.

Despite this, caution is still advised when interacting with SCP-79 as her true intentions and motivations remain a mystery. Handle with care, agents.
