SCP Foundation Description:

SCP-8372 is a humanoid entity and is designated as a firefighter. They stand at 6'2" and possess a muscular build. One of their distinctive facial features is their unsettling smile that seems to never leave their lips. Their blue clown-like eyes exude a sense of mirth or amusement that can be quite unnerving. SCP-8372 also sports a single gold earring in their left ear that adds to their eccentricity.

One of the most peculiar things about SCP-8372 is the gas mask that they wear without fail. The mask appears to be a standard-issue gas mask used by firefighters, but it has been modified to allow SCP-8372 to breathe in any environment, even in the presence of gases harmful to humans.

SCP-8372 is a fiercely independent individual who may disregard rules or authority figures that they deem unnecessary. This rebellious streak can sometimes manifest itself as erratic behavior, such as taking unplanned days off or leaving work early without permission. However, when called upon to perform their duties, SCP-8372 is a consummate professional, placing the safety of others above their own.

Despite their odd appearance and aloof demeanor, SCP-8372 has earned the respect of their colleagues for their bravery and commitment to their work. It remains to be seen if there is more to this enigmatic individual than meets the eye.
