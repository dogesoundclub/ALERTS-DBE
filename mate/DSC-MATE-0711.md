DSC-MATE-711, codenamed "The Jester", is the leader of one of the most powerful mafia factions in the world. His striking appearance is characterized by orange stripes on his face, a red clown nose, and a mouth that stretches unnaturally wide in a permanent grin. His eyes are a piercing blue, and despite their playful look, they seem to have a chilling effect on anyone who dares to meet his gaze.

The Jester's head is topped by a shock of green hair that is always hidden underneath a purple cap. His forehead is marked with two color bands, one blue and one orange, that are said to symbolize his dominance over his rivals. He is rarely seen without his signature gold chain, which dangles from his neck and glitters in the light.

Despite his terrifying reputation, The Jester is known for his great sense of humor and quick wit. He delights in making others laugh and is often seen cracking jokes or telling funny stories. However, those who cross him quickly learn that his humor can quickly turn dark and twisted, with his silly antics giving way to brutal violence at the drop of a hat.

Those who encounter The Jester are advised to proceed with caution, as his unpredictable nature and penchant for violence make him a force to be reckoned with.
