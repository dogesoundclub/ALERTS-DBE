Item#: 2505

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2505 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with adequate space for movement and recreation. Personnel are prohibited from bringing any form of candy or food into the chamber, as they may cause aggressive behavior in the subject. A behavioral monitoring system is to be installed and constantly monitored by trained personnel.

Description: Item #2505 is a male monkey of undisclosed species, resembling the coloration of a capuchin. Its eyes are covered by ski goggles, and a blue bandana is tied on its head. The subject has a gold earring on its left ear, and a silver chain draped around its neck. Its most notable characteristic is the candy stick it frequently carries around. The candy stick is to be considered a potential threat to personnel and must be removed from the subject's possession at all times.

Personality: Item #2505 is characterized by its natural ability to assume leadership roles in any given scenario, whether it be in a professional, social or personal circumstance. It exhibits a high level of intelligence and cunning, enabling it to excel in problem-solving situations. However, the subject has displayed severe hostility when deprived of its candy stick, leading to physical aggression towards personnel.

Addendum: Incident #2505-01 - On ██/██/20██, Item #2505 was observed hoarding its candy stick in its possession, resulting in an aggressive attempt to eliminate all personnel from the containment chamber. The behavioral monitoring system failed to alert the incident, leading to a temporary breach in containment. Following this incident, all personnel entering the subject's chamber are required to wear protective gear and are prohibited from carrying any form of candy or food.
