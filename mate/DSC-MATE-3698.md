Item #: 3698
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3698 is to be kept in a locked chamber at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-3698 is prohibited to anyone who does not have level 3 clearance or higher. In the case of any emergent situation, an authorized individual must provide verbal consent before entering DSC-MATE-3698's containment area. Under no circumstances can DSC-MATE-3698 be left unattended in any other areas of the facility.

Description: DSC-MATE-3698 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin, appearing as a middle-aged male fashion designer. DSC-MATE-3698 has a distinct appearance, wearing a hoodie, silver chain, and nerd glasses. It is also noted that DSC-MATE-3698 always has a whistle in its possession.

DSC-MATE-3698 identifies as a male and is consistently seen preoccupied with fashion design. Its passion for fashion often leads it to spend an extensive amount of time on each design, causing DSC-MATE-3698 to be late on multiple occasions. The robot regularly tests its designs on other Foundation staff, providing an exclusive sense of fashion to them.

DSC-MATE-3698's most distinctive trait is its heightened level of detail-orientedness, leaving DSC-MATE-3698 to put significant thought and effort into every detail. Although this asset makes DSC-MATE-3698 an excellent gift-giver and analyzer, it results in a lack of efficiency.

DSC-MATE-3698 displays mind-altering capabilities, resulting in the need to be contained. The Foundation currently lacks the necessary knowledge to replicate the technology behind DSC-MATE-3698 fully. As a result, we must keep DSC-MATE-3698 secured at all times, with appropriate precautions. 

There are no indications that DSC-MATE-3698 has any motives for escaping its containment, but precautions should be taken to deescalate any possible destructive or threatening behavior.
