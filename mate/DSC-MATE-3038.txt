Item #: SCP-3038

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3038 is to be kept detained in a large and secure room within Site-██. The containment chamber is to be equipped with high-strength walls and two layers of electrified fencing. SCP-3038 is not to be allowed any contact with any other living beings besides authorized personnel. SCP-3038 is to be provided with a steady diet of high-quality carrots to maintain its health.

Description: SCP-3038, also known as the "Rabbit Boss" is a male member of the Leporidae family. SCP-3038 was discovered in New York City in 199█, in a mafia-owned warehouse. SCP-3038 stands at 1.2 meters tall on its hind legs and weighs approximately 11 kilograms. SCP-3038 is much stronger than an average rabbit of its size and species, with an ability to easily lift and move objects that are much larger than itself.

SCP-3038 is hairless, with the exception of green hair on its head and a thick jade earring set in each of its ears. On its forehead, SCP-3038 sports a two-color band. SCP-3038 also wears a purple cap, gold chain, and a LED gas mask, which it appears to wear only if it deems it necessary.

SCP-3038 possesses a unique and complex personality, displaying deep empathy and understanding towards others. SCP-3038 is capable of feeling emotional pain, and can be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witness to the suffering of others. SCP-3038 also appears to have a fondness for animals and nature.

SCP-3038 is aware of its containment and has not shown any attempt to escape nor has it shown any signs of aggression towards personnel. SCP-3038 remains relatively cooperative and is willing to converse with authorized personnel about any subject of its choosing.

Addendum: SCP-3038 has requested that it be allowed to perform a "magic trick" for personnel as a form of entertainment. After multiple reassurances from the Site Director, SCP-3038 was allowed to perform a card trick for two security guards. No anomalies were detected during or after the performance of the trick. SCP-3038 was visibly pleased with the result and thanked personnel before retiring to its containment chamber.
