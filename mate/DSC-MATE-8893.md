Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8893 is to be kept under constant surveillance by two Level 3 personnel, with all interactions being recorded and analyzed for any anomalies. DSC-MATE-8893's movements are to be tracked at all times by GPS, and access to classified information is to be restricted. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-8893 to influence political decisions are to be closely monitored and reported to higher-ups immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-8893 is a female human politician who exhibits several noticeable physical features. She has a green head with pronounced edge curls, spotted skin, and purple lips. DSC-MATE-8893 wears normal glasses to correct her vision, medical masks to prevent the spread of diseases, and a jade earring on one ear for an unknown reason. She also wears a silver chain as a necklace.

DSC-MATE-8893's personality tends to make it forgetful and absent-minded, often losing track of time, forgetting appointments, and missing meetings. The foundation believes that DSC-MATE-8893's forgetfulness is linked to its anomalous properties, which can have disastrous consequences if left unchecked.

DSC-MATE-8893's abilities are still under study. However, the foundation assumes that DSC-MATE-8893 can influence the perception of others, making them forgetful and absent-minded like themselves. DSC-MATE-8893's abilities have a range of approximately 100 meters, and any individual within the range of DSC-MATE-8893's influence will be affected.

Addendum: After analysis of DSC-MATE-8893's actions, it has become evident that DSC-MATE-8893's anomalous properties are politically-driven. DSC-MATE-8893 appears to have a keen sense of political events and uses its abilities to influence key individuals in politics on multiple occasions. Therefore, the foundation has increased security measures and restricted access to DSC-MATE-8893's data to prevent any potential exploitation by third parties.
