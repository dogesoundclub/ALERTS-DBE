Subject 4668 is a human delivery driver, exhibiting some peculiar physical characteristics. The subject's eyes, for instance, bear an eerie resemblance to those of a clown, colored a deep blue that borders on neon. The subject's head is parted down the middle, and the hair displays a cotton-candy shade of pink. Moreover, the subject sports a green cross earring on one ear, while the other remains bare. 

The subject always wears a medical mask to cover their mouth, which often adds an air of mystery and intrigue to their overall appearance. But the most striking feature of the subject is the silver chain that they always carry around their neck, clutching it tightly at all times. 

Despite their peculiar appearance, subject 4668 bears a gentle personality that is truly endearing. They have a deep empathy and understanding for others and may be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when they witness someone else's pain or suffering. Their affinity for animals and nature is also apparent, and they may often be found feeding stray cats or rescuing birds that have fallen from their nests. 

Given their exceptional sensitivity and kindness, subject 4668 may prove to be an invaluable asset to our research and development of paranormal entities. Further study is warranted to determine the extent of their abilities and sensitivities.
