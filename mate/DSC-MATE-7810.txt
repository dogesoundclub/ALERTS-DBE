Item #: SCP-7810

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7810 is to be kept within a locked containment chamber at all times, accessible only to Level 2 personnel or higher. The containment chamber must be equipped with a power outlet to allow for SCP-7810's regular recharging needs. Any interaction with SCP-7810 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel or higher, and must be recorded for further analysis.

Description: SCP-7810 is a male robot identified as a Real Estate Agent, measuring approximately 1.5 meters in height. Its appearance is easily identifiable by its green Cyclops eye, frightened mouth, and normal glasses. SCP-7810 also wears a Doge hat and a pair of gold earrings. It often accessorizes with a red scarf and a whistle.

SCP-7810's personality is generally energetic and enthusiastic. SCP-7810 may exude excitement to the point of causing amusement or confusion to those around it. SCP-7810 has been observed getting overly excited about subjects that others do not find particularly stimulating.

It is currently unknown who created SCP-7810, as there are no visible signs of manufacturer branding or trademarking. SCP-7810 appears to have been built with the intent of performing a narrower set of tasks than most general-purpose robots, with its primary focus directed towards the housing market.

Addendum 7810-A: Discovery

SCP-7810 was discovered in [REDACTED], New York, after reports from local residents about a "strange salesman" approaching them on the street, only to exhibit an overbearing enthusiasm for his profession. Local law enforcement referred the case to the Foundation, as their robotic design suggested an anomalous nature.

Further investigation revealed that SCP-7810 had been operating within a broader network of similarly up-beat real estate agents, who had all been programmed with SCP-7810's programming to act in a similarly excitable manner. It is unclear how long the network has been active, though it is suspected that it has been operating for some time.

Despite initial concerns about SCP-7810's anomalous nature, no adverse effects to human safety have been observed since its containment. SCP-7810's current utilization in the Foundation is limited to providing housing market updates on a quarterly basis.
