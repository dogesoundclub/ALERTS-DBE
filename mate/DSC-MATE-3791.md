Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3791 is to be monitored at all times via CCTV and tracker devices implanted in their person. Subject 3791 is not to be allowed to operate any form of transportation that could prove hazardous to the public at large. Clearance Level 2 personnel are authorized to administer appropriate amnestics to anyone who witnesses Subject 3791's anomalous properties.

Description: Subject 3791 is a human male, approximately 35 years of age. Subject 3791 works as a train driver for a major metropolitan transit authority. Subject 3791's appearance is noted to be consistent with that of a standard train driver. However, Subject 3791's behavior is erratic and unpredictable.

Subject 3791 tends to be extremely spontaneous, often taking risks or doing things on a whim. This behavior can lead to hazardous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff or bridge into a body of water. Subject 3791's personality is not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by an unknown anomalous effect.

Subject 3791 has several visible physical anomalies. They have a constant frightened expression on their mouth, and a two-color band on their forehead. Subject 3791 wears a medical mask over their mouth, possibly to conceal their strange facial expressions. They also wear a gold earring and a silver chain, both of which hold no anomalous properties.

Subject 3791's anomalous behavior has not yet been fully understood, but several theories suggest that it may be related to an unknown entity or DSC. Further research is required to determine the full extent of Subject 3791's anomalous properties.

Addendum: Subject 3791's anomalous nature has been deemed a public safety risk. Appropriate amnestics have been administered to anyone who may have witnessed Subject 3791's behavior. Further containment measures may be necessary pending the finalization of research.
