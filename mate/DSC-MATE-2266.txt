Item #: SCP-2266

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2266 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, with adequate space for movement and exercise. The cell must be fitted with suitable security measures to prevent unauthorized access or escape. SCP-2266 must be provided a sufficient supply of meat every few days or as needed. Access to SCP-2266 is strictly limited to Level 4 personnel, and all interactions must be conducted through a speaker system.

Description: SCP-2266 is a male tiger with noticeable features such as nerdy glasses, a blue bandana around its head, and a gold earring on its right ear. Unlike other tigers, SCP-2266 possesses a humanoid physical form and the ability to speak fluently with those around it. SCP-2266 had worked as a train driver before being captured by Foundation personnel. Further investigation revealed that SCP-2266 has superior train driving skills compared to any human.

Personality: SCP-2266 displays a dominant and assertive personality. Its communication is direct, and it strives for maximum efficiency without consideration for any potential limitations. This commanding demeanor can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating, but it's because SCP-2266 wants to ensure that everything is running smoothly and effectively.

Addendum: During his attempted escape from containment, SCP-2266 provided assistance in stopping the spread of a breached anomalous source. SCP-2266, through its superior train driving skills and quick thinking, prevented the anomalous source from causing further damage to the city. SCP-2266 has been granted a Level 3 security clearance in recognition of his contribution.
