Item #: 7218

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7218 is to be contained within a reinforced steel cage measuring no less than 7m x 7m x 7m. The cage must be located in a soundproof room with a two-meter thick concrete wall around it. Under no circumstances should any staff member approach the creature without appropriate backup at any given time. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to assume the worst and evacuate the immediate vicinity until the creature is secured.

Description: 7218 is a male tiger of indeterminate age with a frightened mouth. Its head is not arranged green, and its ears are adorned with a jade earring. The creature carries a whistle with a length of cord around its neck as its favorite accessory.

The entity's personality suggests an attentive and sharp-witted demeanor, allowing it to be outstanding gift-givers. Nevertheless, its tendency to obsess over finding the perfect present can lead to a great deal of useless, worrisome trouble.

The creature's presence has the remarkable ability to instill panic and unease, making it an incredibly dangerous contact. Its gaze tends to unnerve prey, causing them to experience extreme peril and a sense of dread from its physical presence alone.

But the greatest threat the entity presents lies in its ability to rend through metal, tarp, and bone alike as if they were paper. Despite its tendency to be distracted, 7218 never forgets its intentions or prey.

Addendum: 
Early testing has shown that 7218 has a particular weakness for its favorite food - cattle. As such, adequate provisions are to be made for its consumption, and its diet is to be monitored with care. Due to the creature's intelligence, staff are advised against emotionally provoking it in any capacity.
