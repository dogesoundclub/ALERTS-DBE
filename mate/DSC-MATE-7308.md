Object Class: Safe

Species: Human

Special Containment Procedures: As per the containment protocols, Subject 7308 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, and under the supervision of a designated DSC liaison.

Description: Subject 7308 is a human female of average height and build. Her most striking feature is the alarming coloration of her eyes - they are a blazing red hue that resemble those of a clown. Her orange hair is styled messily, falling downwards and obscuring well over her eyes at the front. She sports a red cross earring on her left ear.

Subject 7308 typically wears a medical mask over her mouth, most likely to hide dental abnormalities or perhaps to maintain sterility during her profession as a mechanic. The said profession could explain the various grease smudges and grime on her clothing and skin.

Personality: Despite her conspicuous appearance, Subject 7308 is well-adjusted and affable. She has an extroverted personality, making friends quickly, and relishes every opportunity to be in the spotlight. Her ability to make others laugh helps diffuse tension in high pressure situations.

Of note is 7308's tendency to be talkative and humorous, often telling jokes that tend to land well with those around her. Corrective actions have been taken to ensure her bantering is kept under reasonable levels during work hours.

Addendum: Subject 7308 shows no anomalous properties in terms of behavior or abilities. Nonetheless, should her already known traits inhibit her work as a mechanic or social interactions, recovery staff are authorized to take further action.
