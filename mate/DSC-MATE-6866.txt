Item #: SCP-6866

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6866 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate life support systems. Interaction with SCP-6866 should be conducted under controlled settings and always in the presence of at least two armed security personnel.

SCP-6866 is permitted to perform her job as a beautician on other SCPs, but only with approval from at least one Level 3 personnel. All tools used during these sessions must be of SCP-approved make and disposals must follow proper hazardous waste protocols.

Description: SCP-6866 is a humanoid female with blue clown eyes and a metal blue head. Her ears bear golden earrings, and she has a medical mask covering her mouth. SCP-6866's appearance is unique and draws attention, especially from first-time viewers.

SCP-6866's personality tends to be logical and analytical, valuing critical thinking and evidence-based conclusions. She enjoys engaging in arguments for the purpose of intellectual exchange, often instigating debates with others on various topics. Despite this, SCP-6866 is overall cooperative with Foundation personnel and is compliant with containment protocols.

SCP-6866 possesses no overt anomalous abilities, but her beauty services have been observed to have a calming and restorative effect on some SCPs. The exact mechanism of this effect is unclear and requires further study.

Additional Notes: It is important to note that SCP-6866 presents no current danger to Foundation personnel or the general public. However, given her unique appearance and the potential for the anomalous effects of her beauty services, SCP-6866's containment should be maintained with vigilance.
