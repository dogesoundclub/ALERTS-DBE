Item #: SCP-7520

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7520 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The cell should be equipped with a standard fast-food restaurant kitchen and supplies for their employment. The LED Gas Mask is to be kept in a secure locker in the containment cell at all times, and is not to be activated without permission from Level 4 personnel. Any attempt made by SCP-7520 to leave containment must be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7520 is a Tiger humanoid with a frightened mouth and glasses as its eyes. SCP-7520 is commonly seen wearing a Doge hat and has a 2-color band across its forehead along with a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-7520 usually wears their LED Gas Mask, which has been modified to allow breathing and consumption of food.

SCP-7520's personality is laid back and easy-going, but can become fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. This has resulted in SCP-7520 getting into heated arguments with individuals who have insulted their friends or family members. SCP-7520 has shown signs of PTSD as a result of its past employment at various fast-food chains. SCP-7520 is capable of understanding human languages and is able to communicate fluently in English.

SCP-7520 was discovered by Foundation personnel after a series of reports of fast-food chains being robbed by an unknown individual who was later confirmed to be SCP-7520. SCP-7520 was apprehended without incident and was cooperative throughout the containment process.

Addendum: SCP-7520 has been granted a request to have access to various fast-food franchises, as it has proven to be an effective and reliable fast-food worker. This request was granted by the Site Director under strict conditions, including that all fast-food franchises visited must be within a 50-mile radius of Site-███ and that SCP-7520 must be accompanied by at least one Level 2 personnel at all times.
