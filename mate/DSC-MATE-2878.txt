[SCP Foundation - Classified]

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2878 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with proper ventilation and medical equipment. Access to the subject is to be granted to authorized personnel only, and all contact is to be monitored and recorded.

Description: Subject 2878 is a male human with a distinct mouth spot and ski goggle eyes. The subject often wears a short peak cap and silver chain, as well as a normal gas mask. Despite these peculiarities, subject 2878 presents no anomalous properties.

However, subject 2878 does possess a unique personality trait. The subject has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This trait is often used to lighten the mood in various situations, and may lead to humorous moments such as telling funny stories or performing silly impersonations.

Despite this seemingly harmless demeanor, subject 2878 has a doctorate in medicine and should not be underestimated. The subject is capable of treating various medical conditions and is therefore an asset to the Foundation's medical team.

As a precautionary measure, any attempt at humorous behavior towards subject 2878 is to be avoided, as it may interfere with the subject's ability to focus on medical procedures.
