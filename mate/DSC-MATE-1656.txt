Description:

SCP-1656 is a male Siberian tiger standing at 3.5 meters tall with a weight of 320kg. However, its most notable feature is the VR Rainbow LED eyes that brightly glows in the dark.

SCP-1656 appears to possess an unnerving degree of intelligence and charisma for a large apex predator. It has demonstrated an ability to effortlessly manipulate and charm its prey, including experienced criminals and other dangerous individuals. This has led to SCP-1656 being able to establish itself as a prominent leader in the criminal underworld, earning the title of “Mafia Boss.”

SCP-1656's personality is one of its most mysterious aspects. It is known for its charisma and charm, with the ability to connect with others on a deep level. Victims of SCP-1656's manipulations have reported feeling as though they were under a trance or hypnotized. SCP-1656's sense of humor is also noted for its ability to bring people closer together, even in the direst of situations.

Addendum 1656-a:

SCP-1656 was first discovered by the Foundation in a high security prison in Russia, where SCP-1656 was incarcerated after being arrested for multiple counts of murder and mayhem. SCP-1656 was able to overpower its captors and escape, leading to a containment breach that caused numerous casualties. SCP-1656 was successfully tracked down and relocated to its current containment facility.
