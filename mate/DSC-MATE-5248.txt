Item #: SCP-5248

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-5248 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced walls and a locking mechanism strong enough to withstand the strength of a Siberian tiger. It is to be fed a diet of raw meat and monitored closely at all times. Any attempt to remove SCP-5248 from its containment cell must be authorized by at least one Level 4 personnel.

Description:

SCP-5248 is a male Siberian tiger of average size and weight, measuring approximately 3 meters in length and weighing around 220 kilograms. It displays a frightened mouth and its irises constantly shift colors in accordance with its mood (as seen in the LED-like eyes). Its head is positioned at a slightly misaligned angle and green in color, with its ears adorned with a golden earring. SCP-5248 also carries a whistle as an accessory.

Despite its more conservative profession as a firefighter, SCP-5258 is known to exhibit spontaneous tendencies and enjoys taking risks on a whim. While this behavior can lead to humorous outcomes, it is important to ensure that SCP-5248 does not engage in reckless or dangerous activities, as it poses a significant risk to both itself and any nearby individuals.

Addendum: Incident 5248-01

On [REDACTED], SCP-5248 managed to escape containment by utilizing its immense strength to break through the reinforced walls of its cell. It was discovered that SCP-5248 had been influenced by a nearby rift in the space-time continuum, leading to its impulsive behavior becoming amplified to dangerous levels. Upon being found, SCP-5248 had jumped off a high-rise building in an attempt to "see what it feels like" to fly.

SCP-5248 was securely returned to its containment cell and closely monitored for any further anomalous behavior. It is important to note that SCP-5248's containment procedures have been reinforced following this incident to mitigate the possibility of any further catastrophic occurrences.
