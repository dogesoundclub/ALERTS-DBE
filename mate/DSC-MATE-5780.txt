Description: Subject 5780 is a human male, approximately 35 years of age, with a strikingly odd appearance. His face features a permanent clown mouth smile with blue clown eyes that appear to be painted on. The subject's head is topped with a doge hat, and his ears adorned with a green cross earring. He is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and holding a cigarette.

Subject 5780 is employed as a banker, displaying a strong sense of duty and responsibility in his work. This sense of responsibility has led him to take on more than he can handle at times, resulting in situations that might appear comical to an outside observer. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to his employer and is often commended for his hard work.

It is unclear how subject 5780 came to possess his unique appearance, and attempts to uncover any medical or mystical reasons have proven fruitless. His behavior is otherwise unremarkable, with no recorded history of violent or aberrant behavior.

Attempts to remove or alter any of the subject's accessories have resulted in extreme resistance and dangerous behavior. Further research is required to determine the extent of his abilities, if any.
