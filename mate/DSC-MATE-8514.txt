Subject 8514, codename "The Tiger Mechanic", is a male Tiger and one of the most skilled mechanics known in the urban fantasy world. With a frightened mouth and eyes shrouded in mystery, 8514 often conceals his emotions, leaving his true intentions in the shadows. However, his doge hat and gold earring add a touch of edginess to his persona.

The Tiger is often seen wearing a silver chain that hangs low around his neck, a symbol of his inner rebelliousness. He often uses his whistle to communicate with his fellow urban fantasy creatures, but some say that it also has the power to control them.

Despite his aloof exterior, 8514 enjoys pushing boundaries and finding ways to twist the rules to his advantage. Although this can lead to humorous situations, it also puts the Tiger at risk of running afoul of the authorities.

Approach with caution when dealing with Subject 8514, as his intentions are often masked by his rebellious nature. But if you need a skilled mechanic to repair your mythical vehicle or devise an enchanted gadget, there is no one better for the job than this enigmatic tiger.
