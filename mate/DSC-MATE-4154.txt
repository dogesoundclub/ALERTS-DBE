Item #: 4154

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4154 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit, furnished with a suitable bed, furnishings, and privacy curtains. No less than two armed security personnel are to guard the subject at all times.

Description:

Subject 4154 is a male monkey, standing at an average height of 3 feet and 6 inches. The subject possesses blue clown eyes and has a unique head accessory in the form of a police cap. This character also features a jade earring on its inches and is often seen sporting additional jewelry, such as a silver chain. In addition, the subject is often seen smoking a cigarette.

The subject typically exhibits a quirky sense of humor that tends to be based on dry and witty observations. They like to tease their friends and acquaintances in a somewhat deadpan way. Although they show a high level of logic, they may demonstrate quirks in their behavior and thought process.

The anomaly came to the SCP Foundation's attention when it was reported that a train driver was exhibiting strange, animal-like characteristics. The Foundation quickly moved the subject to a secure facility for further analysis.

Testing of the subject revealed it to possess remarkable analytical and logical abilities. It's visual and auditory memory was also incredibly acute. However, despite this, their speech is often restricted to simple phrases, displayed through the use of emoticons or written notes.

The subject exhibits no consistent pattern of behavior, although it is generally calm and cooperative. It can communicate with SCP Foundation personnel through the use of sign language and is generally regarded as friendly and approachable.

Addendum:

Numerous attempts have been made to determine the cause of the subject's anomalous properties, but all have failed to identify a clear source. Research continues, but at this point, the subject remains an enigmatic and intriguing specimen for further study by the SCP Foundation.
