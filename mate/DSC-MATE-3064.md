Description: DSC-MATE-3064 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. Its fur is orange with black stripes, typical of the Bengal tiger subspecies. In place of traditional eyes, DSC-MATE-3064 has VR jade LED's, which it claims allow it to see more efficiently than a standard pair of eyes. DSC-MATE-3064 also wears a police cap on its head, a jade earring on one ear, and a red scarf around its neck. It is often seen carrying a candy stick with it.

DSC-MATE-3064's personality is marked by a sharp wit and a love of debate. For the most part, DSC-MATE-3064 engages in playful arguments with friends and family members, enjoying the mental stimulation they provide. However, it has been observed to become more aggressive during debates and has been shown to have a talent for manipulation, making it a dangerous adversary in a courtroom setting.

DSC-MATE-3064 is capable of vocalizing in human language, which it often uses to communicate with its handlers. Its speech is clear and articulate, and it appears to be highly intelligent, with a vast knowledge of legal procedure and theory. DSC-MATE-3064's ability to perform tasks relating to its occupation is comparable to that of a human professional.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3064 has been known to display unpredictable behavior when experiencing high levels of stress. During one incident in which an opposing lawyer brought up a particularly sensitive topic, DSC-MATE-3064's VR jade LED's flashed rapidly and it began attacking the other lawyer, stating that the lawyer had personally insulted its entire race. The other lawyer sustained minor injuries before DSC personnel restrained DSC-MATE-3064. As a result, any potential stress-inducing factors in DSC-MATE-3064's work environment must be closely monitored.
