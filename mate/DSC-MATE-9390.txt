Item #: 9390

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 9390 is to be treated with utmost caution and respect. Due to their unusual personality, they tend to become agitated when surrounded by individuals lacking empathy or compassion. SCP-9390 is currently employed as a traffic officer in downtown ███████, and is authorized to use their special abilities in controlling traffic flow in the area.

Description: SCP-9390 is a male monkey of unknown age, measuring approximately 85 cm in height and weighing 35 kg. Their eyes have been replaced with VR Rainbow LED screens, which allow for enhanced detection of traffic movements and the ability to project signals despite inclement weather. SCP-9390 is often seen wearing a bucket hat, a red scarf, and carrying a whistle on their person. While SCP-9390 may appear non-threatening, they possess an unusual quirk in their behavior that makes them exceptionally loyal and affectionate towards inanimate objects.

Personality: SCP-9390 is nurturing and caring, often showing compassion and empathy towards others, whether animate or inanimate. This can range from giving their vehicle a name, talking to their plants, or anthropomorphizing household appliances. Due to their strong desire to care for the world around them, SCP-9390 is best suited for roles that allow them to express their compassion, such as a traffic officer. However, extreme caution must be taken with individuals who lack empathy, as this may cause SCP-9390 to become agitated and behave in an unpredictable manner.

Addendum: SCP-9390 has expressed a fascination with technological devices, and requests for further integration of technology in their line of work have been submitted by SCP-9390. These requests have been granted on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration given to the possible consequences of introducing such technology to SCP-9390's world view.
