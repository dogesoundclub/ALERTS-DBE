Item #: 7928

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7928 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell should be no less than 5 meters in length, width, and height to accommodate the subject's needs. The cell must be furnished with soft surfaces and appropriate hiding spots for the subject to retreat to when feeling threatened. 

Any interactions with 7928 must be approved by a Level 3 or higher personnel. During interactions with 7928, all personnel must wear ear protection, as the subject's vocalizations can be extremely loud and frightening.

Description: 7928 is a male rabbit of the lop-eared breed. The subject's fur is green in color and appears to be arranged haphazardly. Subject 7928 displays blue clown eyes that have been noted to dilate when experiencing strong emotions. 

The subject displays a red victory band that wraps around its forehead, which has been noted to be a prized possession for the subject. Subject 7928 also displays a gold earring on its right ear and wears a silver chain around its neck. 

In addition to the jewelry described above, subject 7928 carries a candy stick, which it will often offer to others as a form of gift or appeasement. 

When interacting with other beings, subject 7928 displays a tendency towards impulsivity and acting on its emotions. This behavior has led to several humorous situations, though it is important to note that subject 7928 should still be approached with caution, as it can become frightened easily and has been known to lash out in self-defense. 

Addendum: Subject 7928 was brought to the Foundation's attention after several reports of a giant green rabbit causing chaos in a local mechanic's shop. The subject was successfully contained without incident and has been cooperative during its time in containment. 

Any attempts to release subject 7928 back into the wild must be met with extreme caution, as the subject's potential impact on the environment is unknown.
