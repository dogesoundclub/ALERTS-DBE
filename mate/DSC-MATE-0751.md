DogeSoundClub report on subject 751, aka "The Clown":

Subject 751 is a male human who works as a reporter. It is noted that the subject has several distinctive features, including spots on his face, a wide smile, and red clown eyes. Additionally, subject 751 is often seen wearing a retro cap, gold earring, and a silver chain.

Of note is subject 751's choice of accessory, an LED gas mask. The reasons for this are unclear, but it appears to be a statement piece as much as a necessary functional object. It is currently being investigated whether the subject is involved in any kind of subversive or countercultural activity.

However, his goofy side can sometimes lead him to engage in humor and playful banter, which may not always be appropriate. It is also noted that the subject has a talent for telling jokes and making others laugh.

Further observation of subject 751 is required to determine the full extent of his psychic abilities and how they may be harnessed for the DogeSoundClub's purposes.
