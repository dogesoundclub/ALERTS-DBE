Item #: 2829

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2829 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to its forgetful nature, all appointments and schedules are to be communicated through written notes and announcements on its cell monitor. 2829 is to be kept away from any devices it may attempt to tinker with or modify.

Description: 2829 is a male human of average height with unique features. Its skin is covered in small, spotty lesions, reminiscent of a virus. It has trademark blue clown eyes and a layer of green growths that cascade down its head. The creature is never seen without its trademark Red Scarf. 

The most peculiar aspect of the creature is a goggle apparatus which is permanently affixed to its forehead, constantly tilted upwards to prevent full vision. When asked about its purpose, 2829 has only provided cryptic responses. The creature also flaunts a Jade Earring in its right ear, though it seems to have no religious or cultural significance.

2829's personality leans towards absent-mindedness and forgetfulness but should not be underestimated. Its memory losses often do not extend to intricate and powerful technology. As a result, it has been known to use its tinkering skills to create devices that pose a significant threat to foundation interests.

Incidents involving the sudden appearance of powerful and dangerous technological devices in urban areas have been linked to 2829's activities. Attempts to apprehend the creature have been met with resistance and aggression, and it has been noted that it seems to be of sound mind when engaged in combat.

Addendum: Incident 2829-2

On █/█/20██, 2829 used materials seemingly gathered from its clothing to effect a prison escape. 2829 used a complex and unspecified device that caused a localized containment breach at its containment cell. The Foundation estimates up to ███ casualties in the ensuing panic before the threat could be contained.

All personnel are advised to remember the forgetful nature of the creature and to report any suspicious activity or breaches of security to superior officers immediately.
