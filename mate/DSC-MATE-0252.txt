SCP-252, also known as "The Farmer," is a human male with an unusual appearance. His eyes resemble ski goggles, and his head is adorned with a peak spike. He sports a unique accessory in the form of a green cross earring, and can often be seen wearing a silver chain around his neck. However, his most distinctive feature is the LED gas mask he wears, which emits an eerie, pulsating light.

Despite his striking looks, SCP-252 is known for his outgoing and charismatic personality. He is extremely sociable and thrives on being the center of attention. He is also known for his penchant for humor, and can often be found telling stories or jokes that leave his listeners in stitches.

While SCP-252 may seem like a friendly and approachable individual, caution is advised when interacting with him. His gas mask emits an unknown substance, which may have adverse effects on those who come into contact with it. Additionally, his green cross earring has been known to emit bursts of energy, which can cause physical harm if not handled properly.

As a farmer, SCP-252 is responsible for tending to several fields on the outskirts of town. However, his true motivations are unclear, and it is possible that he may be involved in shady or even dangerous activities. Those who encounter SCP-252 are advised to exercise caution and report any suspicious behavior immediately.
