Item #: DSC-MATE-1965

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1965 is to be contained within Site-17's Employee Quarters. Upon entering DSC-MATE-1965's containment unit, all personnel must wear hazmat suits due to DSC-MATE-1965's unexplained ability to infect others with the canine Parvovirus.

Description: DSC-MATE-1965 is a humanoid male specimen who appears to be in his late 20s. DSC-MATE-1965's physical attributes are relatively average except for his face, which features bright orange stripes that run down his cheeks to his jaw. DSC-MATE-1965 also wears a large yellow and white Doge hat and medical mask over his mouth.

DSC-MATE-1965 has an undeniable love for brainstorming and creative problem solving, which he frequently displays during his interrogations. It is not unusual for DSC-MATE-1965 to suggest unusual solutions to problems and observe how his peers react.

During his stay at Site-17, DSC-MATE-1965 was documented by our team building small structures out of medical equipment and other miscellaneous objects. However, this behavior ceased when infected with the Parvovirus.

DSC-MATE-1965 is able to infect humanoids with the Parvovirus, which he carries in his saliva. This can be transferred through a single bite or contact with any bodily fluids on an open wound.

It is advised that all personnel must avoid direct contact with DSC-MATE-1965 unless it is absolutely necessary. Should any exposure occur, the standard quarantine procedures must immediately take place. A full recovery is possible with the administration of the Parvovirus antibody within 48 hours of symptom onset. Failure to seek medical attention can lead to severe neurological damage and organ failure.
