Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-748 is to be contained in a soundproof room with reinforced walls to prevent any unintended broadcasts. Access to his live broadcasts is restricted to authorized personnel only, and any abnormal behavior must be reported immediately to Site Director.

Description:
DSC-MATE-748 is a male human news anchor with several distinctive physical features. The most notable is the 'Mouth Spot,' a black mark covering half of his lower lip. The 'Frightened Mouth' feature, coupled with his metal purple head, gives DSC-MATE-748 an unsettling appearance, making many interviewees visibly uncomfortable during broadcasts. His forehead contains a goggle-like accessory, although its purpose and functionality are unknown, and he wears a single green cross earring. He is often seen with a gold chain and a lit cigarette, despite being a non-smoker.

DSC-MATE-748's personality exhibits a notable interest in learning unusual and obscure topics, making him a valuable asset for the Foundation's research division. However, this curiosity also leads to spontaneous outbursts of irrelevant trivia, potentially disrupting important conversations. He has been known to display intense anxiety and fear during sudden, unexpected events, making him a liability in high-pressure situations.

Dr. ██████: Can you explain the purpose of the goggles on your forehead?

DSC-MATE-748: Ah, yes. It's an old family heirloom that's been passed down for generations. I'm not entirely certain what they're for, but I like to wear them in case I ever need them.

Dr. ██████: You seem to have a deep curiosity about the world. Does that ever interfere with your job as a news anchor?

DSC-MATE-748: (laughs) Yes, it has been known to happen. I can't help myself sometimes; I just love learning new things. But I always make sure to stay focused on the task at hand.
