DogeSoundClub Containment Report: 5105

Identification Number: 5105
Job: Police Officer
Species: Human

Description:
Subject appears as a female human with pronounced purple lips, and blue clown eyes. Her head is covered in lively green hair with edges shaped in curls. The subject's forehead features a two-colored band, which is believed to have a ceremonial significance to her. She is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck, which is believed to have some form of sentimental importance to her.

Personality:
Subject 5105 has shown herself to be outgoing, with a love for adventure and often takes risks, relishing new experiences. Despite her dangerous approach to life, she has survived various near-death experiences such as bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. Her difficulty in following orders and her erratic behaviour have led to her partnering with fellow DSC agents to keep her in check.

Containment:
 Subject 5105 must be kept under close surveillance due to her unpredictable nature. She is allowed to continue serving as an DSC foundation police officer, where she proves to have some level of compunction toward suppressing other anomalies. Access to weapons and extreme sports equipment must be limited, to avoid any incidents of insubordination.

Conclusion:
DSC Subject 5105 represents a rather rambunctious and dangerous addition to the Foundation's efforts to contain anomalies. She shows capability in combat and strategic planning, but her unpredictable nature undermines her abilities. In her current state, her containment requires continuous monitoring and evaluation.
