Item #: SCP-4525

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4525 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cell with a single entry point. Access to SCP-4525 is strictly prohibited except for approved research purposes. All personnel interacting with SCP-4525 must wear approved level 4 biohazard suits with built-in headsets.

Description: SCP-4525 is a human male with multi-colored, VR Rainbow LED eyes and a constant gleeful smile. The subject is generally observed wearing a hoodie, silver chain, and smoking a cigarette. SCP-4525 has demonstrated the ability to manipulate reality, particularly in the form of creating and modifying illusions. SCP-4525 is also known to have an unpredictable and elusive personality, making containment particularly challenging.

SCP-4525 has, on multiple occasions, been classified as a villain by various parties due to a tendency to cause destruction and chaos. SCP-4525 is particularly dangerous, as it exhibits an apparent immunity to traditional defenses such as firearms, explosives, and other forms of deadly force. While the subject has not shown any overt hostility towards Foundation personnel, caution is still advised.

SCP-4525's personality is often described as laid-back and easy-going, but also fiercely loyal and protective towards its loved ones. To date, SCP-4525 has only utilized its reality-warping abilities for their own amusement and entertainment, although there is some debate within the Foundation regarding its actual motivations.

Addendum: Incident 4525-Alpha
On ██/██/████, SCP-4525 exploited a weakness within Foundation containment protocols, resulting in catastrophic damage to the secure facility. All personnel at the site were rendered unconscious, and SCP-4525 escaped. Foundation operatives are currently conducting a worldwide search for SCP-4525's whereabouts.

Conclusion: Under no circumstances should SCP-4525 be approached by anyone except those with explicit permission from the O5 Council. SCP-4525 is to be considered extremely dangerous, and all personnel are advised to remain vigilant in their efforts to apprehend the subject.
