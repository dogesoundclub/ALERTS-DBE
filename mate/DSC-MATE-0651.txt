Item #: SCP-651

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-651 is to be monitored regularly and is not to be permitted unrestricted access to areas outside of her designated work zone without prior approval from Site Director. Any instances of SCP-651 becoming lost in thought or exhibiting unusual behavior must be immediately reported to Senior Researcher ████████.

Description: SCP-651 is a female human veterinarian with blue clown eyes, spots on her face, red lips, and blonde hair with a wing. SCP-651 also has jade earrings, a medical mask covering her mouth, and a gold chain around her neck. SCP-651 is known for her introspective nature, which causes her to often become lost in thought. This has led to many comical incidents, such as walking into a pole or tripping over objects while daydreaming.

Further investigation has revealed that SCP-651 has a unique ability to communicate with animals on a level that is not currently understood by modern science. SCP-651 has been observed calming agitated animals, and has even been seen to miraculously heal animals that were previously thought to be beyond medical care.

SCP-651 has not exhibited any harmful or anomalous behavior, and has been deemed safe for continued research and observation. SCP-651 is permitted to continue her work as a veterinarian, but must be monitored closely to ensure her anomalous abilities and introspective nature do not threaten the safety of Foundation personnel or the public.
