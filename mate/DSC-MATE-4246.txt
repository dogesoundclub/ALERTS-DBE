Item #: 4246

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4246 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Interaction with this individual should be handled with extreme caution, as their strong idealistic beliefs may lead to potential security breaches. All food and drink offered to subject 4246 must first be tested and approved by on-site personnel.

Description: Subject 4246 appears to be an average human male, with a height of 6'1" and a weight of 150 lbs. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that this individual's physical appearance is far from normal. Their frightened mouth, red clown eyes, and 2-color band on their forehead all contribute to a deeply unsettling and jarring appearance. Additionally, subject 4246 sports a jade earring, gold chain, and an LED gas mask.

Personality: Despite their unusual appearance, subject 4246's defining characteristic is their strongly idealistic personality. They are known to actively protest and boycott businesses or causes they believe are contrary to their values. This propensity towards activism has caused numerous headaches for site security, with subject 4246 often going to great lengths to voice their opinions.

Notes: Subject 4246 remains a mystery to Foundation personnel, with no background or origin information on this individual available. As such, extra caution must be taken when interacting with subject 4246, as their motivations and beliefs remain mysterious and potentially volatile.
