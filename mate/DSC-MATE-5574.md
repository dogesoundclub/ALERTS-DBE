Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5574 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with a reinforced door and two layers of electrified fencing, as well as an observation window for monitoring purposes. The chamber must also be furnished with a bed, a table, and a set of chairs to provide basic comforts for DSC-MATE-5574.

DSC-MATE-5574 is allowed a limited amount of freedom within the facility, but must always be accompanied by at least two armed guards. Under no circumstance is DSC-MATE-5574 to be allowed outside the facility.

Description: DSC-MATE-5574 is a male tiger who possesses the ability to transform into a human form. In his humanoid form, DSC-MATE-5574 appears as a fashion designer with a red beanie and jade earring. His mouth is always in a state of frightened expression, and his eyes resemble those of a clown, which are red in color.

DSC-MATE-5574 appears to have an adventurous personality, with a particular affinity for risk-taking and trying new things. This has resulted in some entertaining and humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness.

DSC-MATE-5574's behavior can be unpredictable and erratic at times, which makes him a potential danger to himself and others.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5574 was recovered during a routine sweep of a known anomalous hot spot. DSC-MATE-5574 initially resisted capture and caused significant damage to the surrounding areas before being subdued by Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-5574 is cooperative with Foundation staff and has shown no signs of aggression towards them. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-5574's anomalous properties.
