Item #: 2248

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2248 is to be kept in a secure, soundproofed room with no fewer than three armed guards at all times. Under no circumstances are any personnel to make any physical contact with 2248. Any personnel assigned to 2248's containment are to undergo intensive psychological evaluation before and after their assignment.

Description: 2248 is a female human, standing at approximately 5’7” and weighing roughly 120 lbs. She has orange stripes on her cheeks and a distinctively purple lip. Her hair is blonde with an unusual, feathered appearance, and she wears jade earrings. The subject is often seen wearing a choker and a LED gas mask.

The anomaly's personality is highly charismatic, capable of charming and manipulating those around her to do her bidding. This ability appears to be consistent, regardless of the target audience's gender, age, or overall temperament. Note that under no circumstances should anyone attempt to directly communicate with 2248. Engaging with the subject verbally may result in severe psychological effects on the subject, ranging from uncharacteristic kindness to extreme violence.

The subject is a self-proclaimed "mafia boss,” with several loyal subordinates. It is currently unknown if 2248 holds any actual power over the Mafia beyond her subordinates' loyalty to her. Her subordinates often act in unison with the subject, following her orders without question. It is unknown if this is due to the subject's charisma or some other anomalous property.

Addendum 2248-1: During testing, it was discovered that 2248's controlling influence extends to visual recordings and broadcasts of her presence. The effect was still present in footage watched weeks after the initial recording, suggesting that the control effect may last indefinitely.

Addendum 2248-2: 2248's true name and identity are unknown, as are the circumstances surrounding her acquisition of the title "mafia boss." Any personnel with knowledge of the subject's origin or the organization she leads are to report their findings immediately to their superiors.
