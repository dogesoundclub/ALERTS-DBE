Item #: SCP-9606

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9606 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with a specialized chamber attached for his comfort. The living space should be decorated with vibrant colors related to his species, and toys and treats must be provided to maintain his mental well-being. SCP-9606 must be fed a diet of hay, vegetables, and fruit daily. All personnel must wear protective gear and undergo a decontamination process before entering SCP-9606's containment chamber.

Description: SCP-9606 is a male Rabbit beautician, standing tall at 1.5 ft (0.46 m) and weighing approximately 5 lbs (2.27 kg). They have VR Rainbow LED eyes and wear a blue bandana on their head, with a goggle on their forehead. SCP-9606 has a gold earring on their left ear and wears a gold chain around their neck. They often carry a candy stick with them, which they use as a pacifier for stress relief.

SCP-9606 has an unusual personality for its species, showing a strong sense of duty and responsibility. They are highly meticulous in their work and take great pride in their grooming abilities. Despite their focused work ethic, SCP-9606 knows how to let loose and enjoy oneself, which manifests in their love of dancing and silly antics.

SCP-9606 has demonstrated the ability to communicate with other rabbits, displaying a high intellect and social proficiency. They have also presented with inexplicable yet advantageous healing abilities, which are yet to be fully explored.

SCP-9606 was first discovered in a bunny salon in [REDACTED], where several anomalous incidents occurred. SCP-9606 was referred to the SCP Foundation after their unique abilities and behavior caught the attention of several covert operatives.

Addendum: SCP-9606 has proven to be a valuable asset in the containment of other SCPs, especially those with animalistic qualities. However, due to their exposure to various anomalous entities, SCP-9606's health remains a concern, and constant monitoring is necessary.
