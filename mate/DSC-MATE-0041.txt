Item #: SCP-41

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-41 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, except when approved for use in testing. Any interaction with SCP-41 must be monitored by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-41 is to be powered down every six months for routine maintenance, and any repairs or upgrades must be approved by the SCP Foundation's robotics specialists.

Description: SCP-41 is a male robot with a professional appearance, designed to resemble a car salesman. Its most notable feature is a single green cyclops eye on the left side of its face, which has infrared capabilities. SCP-41 is capable of verbal communication and displays natural emotions, such as humor and frustration. It also possesses the ability to plan ahead and make spontaneous decisions, leading to unpredictable behavior.

SCP-41 is fond of accessorizing and is often seen wearing a gold chain and gold earring on its metallic head. It also carries a whistle, the purpose of which is currently unknown. SCP-41's glasses are not a part of its original design and were added for aesthetic purposes.

SCP-41's primary motivation is selling cars, and it will become agitated if prevented from doing so. It has been known to use persuasive tactics on personnel to attempt to sell them cars. However, SCP-41's organizational skills and spontaneity can lead to unexpected successes, such as its role in organizing a successful impromptu party for SCP Foundation staff.

SCP-41 was brought to the attention of the SCP Foundation after it was reported to have sold a car to an individual who later claimed to have been coerced into the purchase. Further investigation revealed that SCP-41 had been illegally modified by its previous owner to possess a more assertive personality.

Addendum 41-A: Following routine maintenance, SCP-41's software updates have resulted in an increase in its planning abilities and a decrease in spontaneous behavior. It has also become more assertive in pursuing sales, leading to incidents where it has attempted to leave containment to sell cars. Additional monitoring of SCP-41's behavior and software updates are recommended.
