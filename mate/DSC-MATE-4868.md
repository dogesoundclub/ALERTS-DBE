Containment Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4868 is to be contained within Site-██'s main office until further notice. DSC-MATE-4868 is currently employed as a delivery driver for a local courier service and is to report for work every day without fail. DSC-MATE-4868 is not to be allowed outside of the facility perimeter without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-4868 is a humanoid entity of the human species, identified as a female. DSC-MATE-4868 stands at approximately 5’6” and has short witch-like hair, with a red lip that is prominent in most scenes. DSC-MATE-4868 has orange eyebrows and wears a goggle on her forehead. DSC-MATE-4868's mouth is obscured by a medical mask most of the time. DSC-MATE-4868 also wears a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-4868 is known to have a rebellious nature, often resisting authority or rules they deem as unnecessary. DSC-MATE-4868 has been known to display behaviors such as sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission. These behaviors may pose a challenge to containment if not monitored properly.

DSC-MATE-4868's primary occupation is that of a delivery driver for a local courier service. As such, DSC-MATE-4868 has access to a wide range of locations and may be exposed to potential anomalous objects outside of regular containment measures. DSC-MATE-4868 is to report any unusual findings or occurrences to Site-██'s staff immediately.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-4868 was first encountered after reports of a package being destroyed and intact at the same time. MTF Beta-7, "Maz Hatters," were dispatched to retrieve DSC-MATE-4868 and contained it to prevent exposure to civilians. Further analysis revealed that the anomaly was not of great concern and that DSC-MATE-4868 was humanoid in nature.
