Item #: SCP-8055

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8055 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate accommodations made for a rabbit's needs. SCP-8055 is to remain restrained at all times when outside of its containment chamber. All personnel interacting with SCP-8055 must be provided with appropriate protection gear, including gloves and goggles, to prevent accidental injury or exposure to anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-8055 is a male rabbit with horned-rim glasses and a hoodie that obscures its face. SCP-8055 is frequently seen wearing a silver chain as an accessory. Despite its small size, SCP-8055 has shown to possess anomalous abilities that allow it to take physical risks and seemingly survive significant harm, such as jumping off a cliff into a lake or river without visible injury. SCP-8055's reasons for taking these risks are still unknown.

SCP-8055 is an efficient delivery driver, often displaying a level of speed and accuracy that is considered anomalous, even for rabbits. Its ability to disappear and reappear seemingly at random has also led to concerns about its ability to navigate time and space.

SCP-8055 has shown to be personable and even humorous in its interactions with Foundation personnel, particularly when discussing its latest adventures. It is uncertain at this time whether SCP-8055's spontaneous nature is a result of its anomalous abilities or simply reflective of its personality.

Addendum: Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, SCP-8055 should not be underestimated. Its anomalous abilities pose a risk to personnel, and its motivations for taking risks have yet to be fully understood. All interactions with SCP-8055 should be conducted with caution and in accordance with Foundation protocols.
