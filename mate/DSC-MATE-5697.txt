Item #: 5697

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 5697 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber with a built-in clinic for regular medical check-ups by Foundation personnel. Access to the subject is limited to Level 4 personnel only. Under no circumstances should the subject be allowed to leave the facility or interact with any non-Foundation personnel without approval from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description:
Subject 5697 is a male rabbit standing approximately 18 inches tall, with a blue bandana tied around his head and gold earring in his left ear. His eyes are a bright blue color, resembling clown eyes.

Subject 5697 is a licensed veterinarian and possesses the ability to connect with others on a deep level. His charisma is particularly noteworthy, as he can quickly build rapport with both humans and animals, even rescuing endangered animals and nursing them back to health.

Subject 5697's ability to connect with others can lead to humorous situations, as unsuspecting individuals often share personal details and humorous anecdotes that they would not have otherwise shared. These interactions have led to Foundation personnel questioning the extent of subject 5697's abilities.

Addendum:
Subject 5697 has been observed to possess a unique trait, allowing him to communicate with other animals, despite their species' inherent language barriers. Further research is required on the full extent of this ability and its potential applications.

Note from Dr. [REDACTED]: Subject 5697 is a valuable asset to the Foundation's research and rescue efforts. Despite his cheery demeanor, the subject is to be carefully monitored for any potential breaches in containment.
