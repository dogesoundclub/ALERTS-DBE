Item #: 1489

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 1489 needs no containment, as she has been confirmed as a baseline human with no anomalous properties.

Description: 1489 is a female human with orange eyebrows and red cross earrings. She is often seen wearing a gold chain and a normal gas mask. Her attire is that of a reporter, and she is known to work at the local newspaper. 

The subject has shown excellent observation skills and a keen eye for detail, making them a valuable asset for investigative reporting. However, their perfectionist tendencies can lead to them becoming overly concerned with finding the "perfect" gift, causing them to spiral into a state of anxiety and stress.
