Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6449 must be kept in a soundproof containment chamber at all times due to their tendency to cause chaos and mayhem. It is essential that all interaction with 6449 must be kept to a minimum and only carried out by experienced agents. Access to any candy-related material should be strictly prohibited. 

Description: Subject 6449 appears to be a male human, approximately 28 years of age with spots scattered across their face. Their permanent smile is an unnerving sight for all who encounter them. Their eyes are a distinctive blue clownish shade, and they often accessorize with a doge hat and a jade earring. The subject also always carries a silver chain and a candy stick. 

Personality: 6449 has a strong sense of independence and resists any form of authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This makes them highly unpredictable and occasionally dangerous, as they often engage in rebellious behavior, sneaking out of containment and causing chaos wherever they go. 6449's obsession with candy is well-known; often leading to extreme outbursts of violence when denied access to any sugar-based products. 

Due to the potential danger that they pose, it is highly recommended that all personnel assigned to 6449 remain alert and vigilant at all times. Any unauthorized attempt to engage with or approach them should result in immediate containment measures. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death.
