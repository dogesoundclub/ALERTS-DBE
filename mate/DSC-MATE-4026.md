Item #: 4026 "The Techno-Artist"

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4026 is to be kept in a secure room at all times, monitored by at least two guards with approved Level 3 clearance. Access to Item 4026 is limited to authorized personnel with permission from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: Item 4026 appears to be a female human of average height and build, with orange stripes on her face and a wide smile. The most distinctive feature of Item 4026 is her VR Rainbow LED eyes, which can display a range of colors and patterns. Her 90s brown hair is often styled in a messy bun or ponytail, and she always wears a pair of goggles on her forehead. She also wears a red cross earring and a black choker.

Personality: Item 4026 exhibits a creative and artistic personality, often expressing herself through various hobbies and interests such as painting, drawing, and writing. However, she can also exhibit signs of emotional instability and unpredictability, particularly when her creative process is disrupted or criticized. Her combination of technical knowledge and artistic flair has earned her the nickname "The Techno-Artist" among Foundation personnel.

Additional Notes: Item 4026 is a skilled programmer and has been known to modify the containment systems of other DSCs. As a result, she requires constant monitoring to ensure she does not breach containment or cause any unintended effects. Any attempts to remove her VR Rainbow LED eyes should be avoided, as they have been known to cause intense headaches and disorientation in those who look directly at them.
