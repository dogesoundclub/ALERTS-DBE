Item #: DSC-MATE-97

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-97, also known as "The News Anchor," is to be kept in a secure facility at all times under CCTV surveillance. Any subjects that interact with DSC-MATE-97 must undergo psychological evaluation before and after contact to ensure the containment of any possible memetic or cognitive hazards.

Description: DSC-MATE-97 appears as a Caucasian male in his late thirties with a patchy complexion of spots across his face. His mouth is permanently fixed in a frightened expression. DSC-MATE-97 possesses two-color band on his forehead, blue clown eyes, and a gold earring on his right ear with a gold chain around his neck as well. The subject's anomalous behavior allows him to broadcast subliminal messages through his news broadcasts that can affect the population on a subconscious level. In addition, DSC-MATE-97's presence causes those within the immediate vicinity to experience forgetfulness and confusion, leading to unpredictable and often dangerous situations.

DSC-MATE-97 has been known to exhibit erratic behavior and an inability to concentrate. He can be easily distracted and often forgets important tasks, leading to humorous situations. However, this scatterbrained behavior is a facade, meant to fool those around him while he continues to broadcast his insidious messages to the world.

DSC-MATE-97 was brought to the Foundation's attention after reports of a local television news station broadcasting strange and subliminal messages that caused increasing levels of violence, delirium, and paranoia in the viewing population. The responsible individuals at the station were taken into Foundation custody, and their association with DSC-MATE-97 was uncovered, leading to its containment.

Addendum: Testing of DSC-MATE-97's subliminal messages on D-Class personnel has resulted in heightened aggression, increased delirium, and paranoia. All testing has been terminated, and the use of DSC-MATE-97 as a weapon is prohibited.
