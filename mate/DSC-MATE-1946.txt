SCP Foundation Report - 1946

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the unpredictable nature of subject 1946, it is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage with reinforced glass walls. Its cage is to be surrounded by at least two layers of electrified fencing, topped with barbed wire. Any personnel assigned to interact with 1946 must wear full body armor and a gas mask at all times.

Description: Subject 1946 is a male rabbit whose fur is a bright orange color. Its head is adorned with green hair and a purple cap, with a pair of goggles always worn on its forehead. The rabbit's ears are notable for the jade earrings it always wears. It also accessorizes with a red scarf.

Subject 1946's personality is unpredictable and reckless, often acting before thinking. This can lead to humorous situations, but it also makes it incredibly dangerous. It has been shown to possess abilities that defy scientific explanation, including teleportation and the ability to generate energy blasts from its paws.

In addition to its anomalous abilities, subject 1946 has shown an affinity for causing chaos and destruction wherever it goes. Its unpredictable behavior means that it poses a significant threat to anyone who comes into contact with it.

Addendum: Subject 1946 was discovered when it caused a massive explosion in a populated area. Foundation agents were able to successfully contain it and study its abilities, but due to the inherent danger, it has been designated as Keter-class. All attempts at neutralizing or terminating the subject have been met with failure. Therefore, containment is the only option for keeping the public safe.
