Item #: SCP-7899

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7899 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with furniture and amenities suitable for a human subject. Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-7899 to prevent undue harm or distress.

Description: SCP-7899 (previously known as John Doe) is a human male of indeterminate age, with a distinctive mouth spot and a frightened mouth. They wear normal glasses and a short peak cap, with a goggle on their forehead and a jade earring on their left ear. SCP-7899 also wears a medical mask and a gold chain.

SCP-7899 is a skilled programmer and displays a keen sense of empathy, often tuning into the emotions of those around them. This ability can manifest in unusual ways, such as an ability to defuse tense situations or offering words of encouragement to those in need.

SCP-7899 is generally calm and cooperative with Foundation personnel, but they are prone to moments of panic and confusion, which have resulted in incidents of self-harm in the past. On one occasion, SCP-7899 reported feeling an intense sadness and hopelessness that drove them to attempt suicide. After treatment, SCP-7899 showed no lingering effects of the incident.

SCP-7899's gold chain has been found to possess certain anomalous properties that cause it to resonate with positive emotions, creating an aura of happiness and contentment around the wearer. Foundation staff are advised not to wear the chain for extended periods to prevent the potential for psychological addiction.

Addendum: In light of SCP-7899's unique abilities and positive attitude, they have been approved for limited Level 1 clearance and have been assigned to assist in programming projects with a low risk of exposure to SCP-7899's anomalous properties.
