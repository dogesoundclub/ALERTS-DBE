SCP-1857, authorized nickname "The Monkey Train Driver", is a unique specimen of simian origin currently employed as a train driver. SCP-1857 is a male monkey outfitted in a blue bandana atop its head, signifying its position as the driver of the metropolitan transportation system. Its eyes are fitted with a pair of glasses, presumably to aid in their driving duties. 

In addition to its standard outfit, SCP-1857 also sports a red scarf around its neck. The purpose of the red scarf is currently unknown but may serve as a traditional accessory among its species. 

SCP-1857's species remains unidentified, and its anomalous abilities are still under investigation. However, it possesses a particular set of traits and characteristics that set it apart from non-anomalous primates.  SCP-1857 values tradition above all and may have a no-nonsense attitude while performing its day job. Despite this, SCP-1857 has a playful side, which can lead to humorous situations, such as telling jokes or stories passed down through its family or community. 

Future observation of SCP-1857 by on-site personnel and data collection teams are ongoing to gather more information on its species and anomalous capabilities.
