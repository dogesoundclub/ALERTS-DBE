Addendum 6456.1: SCP-6456 Personal Log

Note: The following transcript of SCP-6456's personal log has been taken from a hidden camera from SCP-6456's residence.

[Begin Log]

SCP-6456: It's always the same thing. The Foundation thinks it can control me, but I'll do what I want. The rules don't apply to me.

SCP-6456 takes a drag from their cigarette before continuing to speak.

SCP-6456: My boss always says that we need to follow protocol, but who cares? Life's too short to follow someone else's rules. I'll sell whatever I like to whoever I like, and there's nothing they can do about it.

SCP-6456 takes another drag from their cigarette and exhales a cloud of smoke.

SCP-6456: I can't believe they think they can contain me. Maybe I'll change the world with what I'm selling. Maybe I'll help someone. Who knows? All I know is that I won't be bossed around.

[End Log]

Closing Statement: SCP-6456's rebellious behavior is a concerning aspect of their personality. Their ability to remain outside of Foundation control may lead to significant challenges in containment and surveillance. Further monitoring is recommended.
