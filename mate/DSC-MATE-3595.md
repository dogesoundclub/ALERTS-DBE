Item #: 3595

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3595 is currently located in a private garage at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3595 is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Description: DSC-MATE-3595 is a sentient monkey of the species Cebus apella commonly known as a "capuchin monkey". DSC-MATE-3595 displays a frightened expression through its facial feature of an open mouth as well as the way it holds itself. It usually sports a retro cap on its head and a pair of normal glasses on its eyes.

Despite its animalistic nature, DSC-MATE-3595 is sentient and capable of performing mechanical repairs on a variety of vehicles, especially cars. It has an innate understanding of how machines work and can easily fix complex machinery with minimal effort. 

DSC-MATE-3595 is usually docile, but it tends to become nervous in situations that exacerbate its natural disposition leading to humorous accidents like unintentionally walking into poles or stumbling over mundane objects when lost in thought. DSC-MATE-3595's introspective nature is attributed to its observed tendency to spend prolonged periods lost in thought or daydreaming.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3595 was discovered when one of its car repair clients noticed its natural intelligence and reported it to Foundation agents. DSC-MATE-3595 was then quickly contained and transferred to Site-██. Continual observation and experimentation on DSC-MATE-3595 will aid in understanding its mechanical capabilities and cognition abilities.
