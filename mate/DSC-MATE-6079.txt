Item #: 6079

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6079 is to be monitored at all times by two agents equipped with Class-B telekinetic shields. She is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with no access to any sentimental material or media. Access to legal documents may be granted with prior approval from a Level 3 supervisor. In case of emotional outburst, the room will be flooded with acoustic noise to mask any sound.

Description: Subject 6079 is a human female of average height and weight, with orange stripes as the recognizable facial feature. She has a loud rainbow festival styled hair that seems to change shade frequently. The subjectâ€™s left ear carries a green cross earring, and a silver chain around the neck. DNA profiling shows no apparent genetic anomaly.

Subject 6079 displays an exceedingly emotional personality with the tendency to express her feelings through tears. While her emotional state may be triggered by movies, TV shows, and music, their source is notably difficult to predict. In addition, her extreme emotions can affect surrounding physical objects in unpredictable ways.

Addendum: After the incident 6079-A, a complete ban on sentimental media was established, and her cell reinforced with an anti-kinetic field generator. Future research on the subject will require additional safety measures.
