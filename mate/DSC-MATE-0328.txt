Item #: SCP-328

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-328 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Food, water, and bedding must be provided to SCP-328 as necessary. SCP-328 is allowed access to a music player within its containment chamber on a strict schedule, as per its request.

SCP-328 is not to be permitted to drive any trains outside of specially designated and monitored testing facilities.

Description: SCP-328 is a male monkey of the species Cercopithecus. SCP-328 possesses various cybernetic implants and modifications, including a set of VR Rainbow LED eyes and a blue bandana worn around its head.

SCP-328 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, most likely due to its previous career as a train driver before containment. However, SCP-328 also exhibits a playful and humorous side, often surprising others with its dance moves and silly antics.

Accompanying SCP-328 is a whistle, which it uses to call for attention when necessary or to signal the beginning of a dance routine.

SCP-328 has expressed its desire to become a DJ and requests access to a music player within its containment chamber on a strict schedule. Testing has shown that SCP-328 possesses an innate ability to mix music and create seamless transitions between tracks.

Addendum: Due to SCP-328's cybernetic enhancements and potential usefulness in transportation, further testing is required to determine the full extent of its capabilities. As such, SCP-328 is not to be terminated unless absolutely necessary.
