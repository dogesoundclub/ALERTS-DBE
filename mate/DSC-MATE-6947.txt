SCP-6947 is known to wear a gold chain and an LED gas mask, which it claims are essential accessories for its operations. It is also rumored that SCP-6947 has a special ability that enables it to influence people's perceptions and memories.

SCP-6947 is a reliable and organized individual, but stubborn and rigid in its ideas and routines. SCP-6947 is known to hold grudges and take revenge on those who cross it. Its loyalty lies with its organization, and it will do anything to support and protect its members.
