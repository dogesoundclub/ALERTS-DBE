Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3213 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished with standard human amenities. As DSC-MATE-3213 is a theater manager, it may be allowed to manage and perform shows under strict supervision. DSC-MATE-3213's movements are to be restricted to within the confines of the containment cell and the theater, and accompanied by at least one security personnel at all times.

DSC-MATE-3213's hairstyle resembles that of a '00s schoolgirl with a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-3213's personality is mainly characterized by an intense degree of introspection, which may cause it to lose track of its surroundings and trip over objects or walk into poles while lost in thought. DSC-MATE-3213 may be prone to bouts of depression, particularly when required to perform shows, as it feels uncomfortable being the center of attention.
