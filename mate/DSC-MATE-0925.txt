Item #: SCP-925

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-925 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-925 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, and all interactions with SCP-925 must be monitored and logged.

SCP-925 is currently employed as a doctor in the site's medical wing. SCP-925 must wear a medical mask at all times while treating patients to prevent any potential contamination incidents.

Description: SCP-925 is a human male of average height and weight. The subject's facial features are notable for the orange stripes across their cheeks and a prominent smile. The subject wears nerd glasses over their eyes and a purple cap with a headset covering the top of their head. There is a goggle on their forehead, and one green cross earring in each earlobe. A gold chain hangs around their neck.

Personality-wise, SCP-925 is very empathetic and compassionate towards others. They display a strong sense of responsibility for others' wellbeing, which can lead to an unhealthy level of personal investment in their patients' lives. SCP-925 may take on other people's problems as their own, and attempt to fix everything and everyone around them. This behavior can be both admirable and exhausting, leading to burnout and potential containment breaches.

SCP-925's dedication to medical care makes them an invaluable asset to the Foundation's medical staff. However, continued monitoring and support are necessary to ensure that the subject does not take on more than they can handle. At this time, SCP-925 does not appear to possess any anomalous abilities.

Addendum: On , during routine interactions with SCP-925, medical staff noted a sudden increase in the subject's empathetic response to patients. Further investigation revealed that SCP-925 had uncovered evidence of a possible anomaly in a recently admitted patient. This incident highlights the importance of continued monitoring and supervision of SCP-925's interactions with others. All medical staff are to report any potential anomalies or unusual behaviors in patients to SCP-925 and the site's security team.
