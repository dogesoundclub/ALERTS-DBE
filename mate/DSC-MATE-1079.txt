Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1079 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All contact with SCP-1079 outside of approved testing must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any personnel entering SCP-1079's containment chamber must wear a gas mask as a precautionary measure.

Description: SCP-1079 is a female human identified as a theater manager. SCP-1079's appearance is unique, with red clown eyes and a distinctive red lip. SCP-1079 wears a bucket hat with a two-color band on the forehead and a silver chain. SCP-1079's most notable accessory is a normal gas mask, which seems to be a permanent fixture on SCP-1079's person, even when not wearing it.

SCP-1079 is highly charismatic, possessing a natural charm that can make them the life of any party. SCP-1079 has a talent for telling jokes and doing silly dances to make others laugh. Despite appearing to be a friendly and harmless individual, SCP-1079 should not be underestimated, as they could potentially use their charisma for malicious purposes.

Addendum: SCP-1079 was initially discovered after reports surfaced of a theater manager in █████, who mysteriously disappeared after a series of strange events occurred on-site. Mobile Task Force Delta-7 (aka "Clown Squad") was deployed to investigate, and SCP-1079 was identified and contained without further incident. Testing is ongoing to determine any anomalous properties beyond SCP-1079's unique appearance and personality.
