Item #: SCP-1366

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1366 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All electrical devices within SCP-1366's chamber are to be heavily insulated and frequently checked for any signs of damage. SCP-1366 is permitted to work as an electrician at Site-██ under supervision and with proper safety precautions in place.

Description: SCP-1366 appears to be a typical middle-aged human male with a distinct mouth spot on their upper lip and a perpetually cheerful smile. However, their eyes are red and reminiscent of that of a clown's, leading to immediate psychological manipulation in any unsuspecting individuals that meet SCP-1366's gaze.

SCP-1366's head is adorned with a traditional monk's hood, with a pair of goggles situated on their forehead. SCP-1366 can often be seen with a green cross earring as well as a silver chain around their neck. They may also carry a candy stick, which they frequently consume.

SCP-1366's personality is best categorized as empathetic, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when they witness someone else's pain or suffering. They also have an affinity for animals and nature. SCP-1366 has displayed a willingness to assist other humanoid SCPs in distress and has been noted as being an effective psychological manipulator during certain containment breaches.

Addendum: SCP-1366 is to be monitored closely for any signs of developing loyalty to other SCPs or any intention to breach containment. In the event SCP-1366 is found to be attempting such actions, it is to be immediately removed from Site-██ and placed in a Foundation rehabilitation program.
