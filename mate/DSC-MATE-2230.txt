Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2230 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-███. Access to SCP-2230 requires Level 2 clearance and must be approved by at least two senior researchers. SCP-2230 is not to be activated outside of testing environments or under any circumstances that could cause harm to human life. 

Description: SCP-2230 is a humanoid robot standing at 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. Its face consists of one large green cyclops eye and a mouth that appears to be in a constant state of fear or shock. While SCP-2230's eyes appear normal, it wears a pair of glasses as an accessory. Its head is adorned with a bucket hat, and it has a gold earring in its left ear. 

SCP-2230 appears to be a fast food worker and is often seen wearing a uniform from a popular fast food chain. The robot is programmed to speak fluently in multiple languages and possess a friendly demeanor. SCP-2230 is equipped with an LED gas mask, which has the ability to filter and neutralize harmful toxins and bacteria. 

SCP-2230's response to human emotion is remarkable, displaying deep empathy and understanding of others. In some instances, it has been observed to be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering. SCP-2230 is also fond of animals and nature, often showing signs of emotional attachment to both. 

Addendum: Testing on SCP-2230 has revealed the potential for it to be used in humanitarian aid efforts or disaster relief. However, it should be noted that SCP-2230's empathy and emotional instability must be taken into consideration during its deployment. Research into SCP-2230's programming and engineering is ongoing.
