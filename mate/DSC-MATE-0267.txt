Item #: SCP-267

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-267 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to basic amenities such as running water, a bed, and bathroom facilities. Guards are to be present at all times when interacting with SCP-267, as it has been known to become argumentative and defensive if confronted.

Description: SCP-267 is a male human of average height and build. His most notable feature is a small blue spot near the corner of his mouth, which he claims is a birthmark. SCP-267 also has a second mouth overlaid onto his primary one, which opens and closes at random intervals. This is believed to be a manifestation of his anomalous properties.

SCP-267's head is covered in several layers of green skin or scales, which he claims is a genetic anomaly. He also wears a jade earring in his left ear and a red scarf around his neck. The subject constantly holds a candy stick, which seems to be a comfort item for him.

SCP-267 has a very analytical and logical personality, often engaging in debates and arguments with researchers and guards. These debates can often become intense, with SCP-267 becoming defensive and aggressive if he feels his points are being dismissed or belittled.

SCP-267 can be cooperative with researchers and guards, but it is recommended that caution is taken when interacting with him, as he has a history of becoming hostile when provoked.

Addendum: SCP-267's anomalous properties are not yet fully understood, but it is believed that they may be related to his second mouth and green layers. Further testing and experimentation are required to determine the exact nature of these properties.
