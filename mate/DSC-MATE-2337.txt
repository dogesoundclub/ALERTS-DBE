Subject 2337, also known as "The Clown Boss," is a feared Mafia leader who wears his signature LED gas mask to every encounter. One can easily recognize him by the red clown eyes that shine through the mask's visor. The mask's LED lights flash in tune with his emotions, making him appear even more menacing in dark alleyways.

The boss's face is covered in spots, making it look like he has a permanent rash. However, his wide, toothy grin easily distracts from the blemishes. On his golden ears, he wears a single gold earring, a sign of his high-ranking status.

The boss's overall appearance is that of an eccentric club-goer, as he dons a gold chain over his black leather jacket. However, anybody who dares to underestimate his power and position learns the hard way how wrong their assumptions were.

The boss's impulsiveness and spontaneous decision-making are often his downfall in the world of organized crime, but those traits also make for some humorous situations. So, it's never a dull moment whenever The Clown Boss is around. The SCP Foundation is advised to approach subject 2337 with extreme caution and only when necessary.
