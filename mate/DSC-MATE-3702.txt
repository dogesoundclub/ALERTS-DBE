Item #: 3702

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3702 must wear a prescribed tracking device at all times during transportation, and all packages must be inspected prior to departure, ensuring the absence of any prohibited or unusual materials. Should subject 3702 deviate from the delivery route, the monitoring team must be alerted immediately, and all measures to locate and retrieve the subject must be taken.

Description: Subject 3702, colloquially known as The Harebrained Courier, is a male rabbit of average height and build. The subject wears a hoodie and normal glasses, with a distinctive 2 color band on its forehead. Despite its occupation as a delivery driver, subject 3702 has displayed a consistent lack of focus and difficulty with attention to detail. These attributes have led to a history of missed or delayed deliveries, as well as frequent episodes of disorientation and forgetfulness.

It is worth noting that subject 3702 displays a non-aggressive demeanor, with a tendency towards jocularity and good humor. However, it is not recommended to engage in extended conversation with the subject, as it often leads to lengthy tangential stories involving personal anecdotes and irrelevant information. Additionally, subject 3702 has exhibited an unexplained ability to navigate through previously unknown areas, often arriving at its destination via unexpected routes.

Addendum: SCP Foundation has implemented a new program, in which subject 3702 will undergo a series of cognitive-enhancing sessions. It is hoped that these sessions will improve the subject's focus and attentiveness, increasing the chance of successful deliveries and reducing the risk of anomalous activity. Further updates to follow.
