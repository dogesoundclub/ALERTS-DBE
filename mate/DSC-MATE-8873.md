Item #: 8873

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8873 is to be contained in a secure, government-held facility. Any personnel interacting with Subject 8873 must wear mandated face masks to prevent potential infection. Under no circumstances should the subject be left unsupervised or allowed to communicate with the outside world. 

Description: Subject 8873 appears to be a male human with distinct orange stripes on their facial features. Their eyes are reminiscent of ski goggles, and with a police cap as their head attire. One noticeable feature is a gold earring adorning one ear while a medical mask obscures their mouth. Strangely enough, Subject 8873 wears a silver chain as an accessory.

Despite 8873's enigmatic appearance, it is important to note the subject's artistic interests. They have a creative and artistic side that they may express through various hobbies or interests. They may enjoy painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of artistic expression. It is this artistic outlet that may be critical in understanding how the subject operates as a politician.

Addendum: The subject has been known to use their artistic talents to sway voters and opponents alike. Their knowledge of how to manipulate color, shape and form gives them an advantage over those who lack such artistic abilities. It is still unclear if the subject's artistic interests manifest in any supernatural or anomalous abilities. As such, interviews and experimentation should be conducted with caution.
