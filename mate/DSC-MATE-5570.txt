Item #: SCP-5570

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5570 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel interacting with SCP-5570 must wear appropriate protective gear.

Description: SCP-5570 is a human male identified as a car salesman, currently measuring 1.7 meters in height and weighing 67 kilograms. While exhibiting no anomalous physical characteristics, SCP-5570's personality traits can be classified as practical and resourceful, often using unconventional methods to solve problems.

SCP-5570's frightened mouth and silver nerd glasses are indicative of his timid demeanor. His head boasts a pointed spike, perhaps used as a display of rebellion or individuality. SCP-5570 also habitually wears a gold chain and carries a candy stick, both of which hold no anomalous properties.

SCP-5570's anomalous nature manifests in his ability to use non-standard means to repair broken objects. He may use improvised solutions, such as duct tape and paper clips or other household items, even in situations that would typically require specialized attention.

Although SCP-5570's abilities are not inherently dangerous, they challenge common norms of repair, and it is unknown how far they can push the boundaries of what is considered "safe" in fixing broken objects. Additionally, SCP-5570's timid nature may result in him being unable to communicate effectively in high-stress situations, increasing the potential for unintended consequences.

Addendum: Despite SCP-5570's seemingly benign nature, interactions with non-anomalous individuals have resulted in confusion or unease regarding his unconventional methods of repair. Therefore, it is recommended to keep SCP-5570's abilities contained within the Foundation's research and development sectors.
