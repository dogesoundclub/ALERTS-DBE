SCP-7323, also known as "The Fast Food Worker", is a human female with distinctive purple lips and VR Jade LED eyes. Her head is shaved on one side, leaving only an orange buzzcut, and she wears a single green cross earring. 

SCP-7323 is never seen without a medical mask covering her mouth, which is suspected to be a result of either germaphobia or hiding some form of supernatural ability. She accessorizes with a black choker, a common trend among goth subcultures.

Despite her mundane occupation, SCP-7323's personality is anything but ordinary. Her spontaneous nature often leads her to make impulsive decisions, which has occasionally resulted in dangerous situations. However, it is unclear whether this impulsiveness is a result of personal preference or a manifestation of her supernatural abilities.

SCP-7323 is currently under observation by the SCP foundation, and as with all humans with unusual abilities, great care must be taken to prevent breaches or public exposure. While the Fast Food Worker appears to exhibit no overtly dangerous tendencies, her unpredictable nature warrants constant vigilance.
