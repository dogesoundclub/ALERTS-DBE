Item #: SCP-3519

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3519 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any requests for maintenance work on Foundation facilities must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3519 is a human male identified as an electrician. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds. SCP-3519's facial features include a frightened mouth and ski goggle-like eyes. Its forehead consists of a peak spike and gold earrings are present on both ears. SCP-3519 is also known to wear a red scarf around its neck.

Personality-wise, SCP-3519 values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude. However, it does possess a playful side and enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down from its family and community. This combination of traits has resulted in humorous situations in the past.

SCP-3519's anomalous nature lies in its ability to manipulate electrical currents. It possesses an innate understanding of electrical systems, allowing it to diagnose and repair any issues at a remarkably fast rate. However, it also has shown the ability to use electrical energy as a weapon, emitting electrical surges from its body.

SCP-3519 was discovered during a small town's annual electrical festival. Witnesses reported seeing SCP-3519 casually manipulating the electrical displays to create impressive light shows. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate, and SCP-3519 was taken into custody without incident.

Addendum: SCP-3519 has expressed several times its desire to return to its hometown during the annual festival. Requests for transfer to a closer facility have been denied due to risk of exposure. However, efforts are being made to allow SCP-3519 to view the festival through live streaming technology.
