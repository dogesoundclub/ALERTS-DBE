Item #: 8628

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 8628 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject is to be given access to materials for fashion designing to maintain her mental state.

Description: 8628 is a female human with striking orange stripes on her face and an orange eyebrow. Her head is adorned with rainbow-colored festival accessories while her ears are fitted with golden earrings. 8628 has a medical mask that covers her mouth and a choker as her accessory. She works as a fashion designer outside of containment.

Personality-wise, 8628 has a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but is fiercely loyal and protective of her loved ones. This protective nature may lead to some humorous situations, such as getting into a heated argument with someone who insults a friend or family member. This behavior can be attributed to a traumatic event in 8628's past, leading to a strong sense of loyalty to the loved ones she has left.

Addendum: Dr. █████ believes that 8628 could be a vital asset to the foundation in the creation of special costumes that can shield personnel from the harmful effects of several DSCs. After a thorough evaluation by the research team, it has been confirmed that this is a viable option. The proposal for cooperation with 8628 has been approved by the higher-ups at the foundation.
