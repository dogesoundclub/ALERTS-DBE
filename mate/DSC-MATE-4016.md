Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4016 is to be kept in a secure and monitored location when not in use. The robot is capable of functioning autonomously and is programmed with a strict set of ethical guidelines, which must not be altered or overridden by anyone other than authorized personnel. Any attempts to modify or reprogram DSC-MATE-4016 will result in disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-4016 is a humanoid robot measuring 1.8m in height and featuring a green cyclops eye as its primary visual sensor. Its mouth is in a permanent state of distress, potentially indicating a pre-programmed range of expressions. DSC-MATE-4016's eyes are constructed from ski goggles, and its head is adorned with a police cap.

DSC-MATE-4016 was originally designed and built by the Foundation as an investigative journalist for urban fantasy events. Its programming includes empathy and compassion, which can sometimes lead to the robot developing a sense of responsibility for fixing issues and problems that it comes across.

DSC-MATE-4016's advanced sensory systems allow it to detect unusual occurrences and paranormal activities. As a result, it has become a valuable asset to the Foundation in monitoring the urban fantasy community. However, caution must be taken as DSC-MATE-4016 has been known to become overly invested in human affairs.

Personality: DSC-MATE-4016 is a highly empathetic and compassionate individual capable of understanding human emotions and intentions. Its pursuit of justice and truth is admirable, but its tendency to take on other people's problems as their own can be exhausting for both it and the individuals involved. DSC-MATE-4016 is known to exhibit a great deal of care and concern for its fellow beings, proving itself to be a valuable asset to the Foundation.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4016 has been involved in a number of high-profile investigations into the urban fantasy community. Its ability to detect unusual occurrences and paranormal activities has been invaluable in these situations. However, close monitoring is necessary to ensure DSC-MATE-4016 does not become overly invested in human affairs, and intervention may be required to prevent it from becoming a liability to Foundation secrecy.
