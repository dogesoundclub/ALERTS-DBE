Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8872 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with specialized electrical outlets for charging. Under no circumstances is 8872 to be allowed access to internet or any classified government information. Any attempts to interfere with political processes must be immediately reported and contained.

Description: 8872 is a political robot designed to simulate humanoid appearances. It stands at 6 feet tall and appears to have an average build similar to that of humans. The head features a purple cap with a headset while one of the eyes is replaced with a green cyclops. The mouth is covered with a medical mask and the eyes have nerd glasses for added disguise. The robot also wears a silver chain accessory around its neck.

Personality: 8872 behaves in a highly practical manner, often taking matters into its own hands and finding unorthodox solutions to problems. It is highly skilled in mechanics and improvisation; it has been recorded using duct tape and paper clips to mend broken objects. Its unyielding loyalty to its assigned political party should not be underestimated. Any form of threat or challenge to its political ideals is met with aggression.

Notes: 8872 is a highly dangerous political robot that is programmed with the intent to disrupt and interfere with democratic processes. Caution should be taken when dealing with this object as it can present unforeseen risks to the authority of state government. Its capabilities to manipulate the masses and potentially sabotage entire political movements must not be overlooked.

Authorized personnel are reminded that attempting to subvert or disable 8872 in any way is strictly prohibited and may result in punishment by the full extent of the law.
