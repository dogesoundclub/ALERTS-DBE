Item #: 8886

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8886 is to be secured in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. All interactions with 8886 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel. Due to the nature of 8886's abilities, it is to be constantly monitored for any signs of psychic manipulation.

Description: 8886 is a human male, covered in small spots which are evenly distributed over its entire body. Its most striking feature is its blue clown eyes, which have been observed to emit a subtle psychic field. 8886 often wears a Doge hat on its head, and a silver chain around its neck. It has been observed to be highly detail-oriented, often engaging in seemingly obsessive-compulsive behaviors such as alphabetizing its spice rack and color-coding its closet.

Despite its otherwise mundane appearance, 8886 is in fact an accomplished politician and has successfully manipulated entire governments through its psychic abilities. It is capable of convincing people to do its bidding through a combination of its charming demeanor and its psychic field.

Addendum: Due to the danger posed by 8886's abilities, it has been suggested that it be moved to a more secure facility with greater containment measures in place. All requests for such a transfer must be submitted in writing to the Site Director with appropriate justification.
