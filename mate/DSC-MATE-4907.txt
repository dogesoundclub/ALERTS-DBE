SCP Foundation Description

Subject 4907, also known as the Traffic Officer, is a human male with a peculiar personality. The subject is identified by his smile, coupled with normal glasses and a short peak cap. In addition, the Traffic Officer wears a medical mask as a preventive measure to protect himself from an unknown inhaled pathogen.

The Traffic Officer is known to flaunt a gold chain which dangles from his neck, drawing attention to him in a unique way. The presence of such an accessory raises questions about its significance and purpose.

Subject 4907's personality is somewhat troubling. The individual possesses an absent-minded character, particularly when deep in thought or engrossed in a task. This occurrence frequently leads to comic and awkward incidents. For instance, the Traffic Officer can miss important appointments or fail to meet deadlines due to losing track of time.

It is recommended that the Traffic Officer be assigned a partner to assist in keeping him focused and accountable in his duties. Further observation, and scrutiny of access to sensitive information is advised as a countermeasure to avoid compromising the agency's work.
