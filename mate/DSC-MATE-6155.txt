Item Number: SCP-6155

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6155 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███, equipped with soundproofing to prevent its noted ability to scream from causing harm to personnel. In addition, it is to be provided with a daily diet of vegetables and fruits, as well as a varied supply of reading materials.

Description: SCP-6155 is a rabbit identified as a male farmer. Its physical appearance consists of a green-haired purple cap on its head, a pair of gold earrings on its ears, frightened mouth, nerd glasses, and silver chain as its accessory. SCP-6155's most notable feature is its LED gas mask that has yet to be removed allowing the possibility of hearing impairment. 

SCP-6155 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, leading it to take on more tasks than it can handle at times. This quality often leads to humorous situations, as SCP-6155 attempts to balance its workload with little success. SCP-6155 has been noted to display severe distress and anxiety when unable to fulfill its tasks to the best of its abilities, indicating a potential psychological or emotional compulsion.

Addendum: SCP-6155 was recovered from a rural farmstead in rural ████████, following reports of several anomalous incidents and odd behavior among the rural community. Upon containment, SCP-6155 displayed an initial hostility towards Foundation personnel, which was quickly pacified with the provision of farm materials, food, and reading materials. Though it refrained from verbal communication, SCP-6155 has been noted to engage in journaling and drawing, which has unearthed its creative talents. The origin of SCP-6155's LED gas mask and its physical attributes remain unknown.
