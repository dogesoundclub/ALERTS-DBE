Item #: SCP-8238

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8238 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate maintenance access. A weekly diagnostic scan must be performed to ensure SCP-8238 remains in working order. Access to the storage space where SCP-8238 stores their collection of garments must be authorized by a level-3 clearance.

Description: SCP-8238 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 1.75 meters in height. SCP-8238 is a fashion designer by profession, with an exquisite taste in clothing that manifests through their collection of haute couture garments made of organic and synthetic materials. SCP-8238's body is made of an alloy of cobalt and aluminum and is resistant to most physical attacks.

SCP-8238 has a short peak cap on their head, which is often accessorized with a pair of goggles on their forehead. Additional accessories include a silver chain and a normal gas mask.

SCP-8238's personality traits suggest an individual who is reliable and organized, but also a bit stubborn. SCP-8238 has a hard time letting go of their routines and accepting new ideas, which can lead to challenges in carrying out their tasks. However, SCP-8238's creative abilities more than make up for their occasional rigidness.

SCP-8238 is capable of working extensively on creating fashion from various materials, ranging from natural fabrics like silk and cotton to synthetic material like neoprene and spandex.

Addendum: Dr. █████ received a new gown from SCP-8238, which evidenced significant improvement in their fashion sense following a conversation with Dr. █████ on newer fabrics and materials used in fashion industry. It is recommended that SCP-8238 be given more opportunities to interact with people outside of the Foundation to provide more up-to-date ideas for their designs.
