Subject 8560, also known as the "Electrician", is a human female that possesses unique features that make her stand out from the rest.

Her sense of humor is infectious, and she often tells jokes and performs silly dances just to put a smile on someone's face. 

While her appearance may be intimidating at first, her personality is warm and welcoming. Subject 8560 is a valuable asset in the mystical community, and her electrical expertise is sought after by many. Her positivity and lightheartedness make her a favorite among her peers, as well as a valuable ally in the fight against the darkness that lurks in the shadows.
