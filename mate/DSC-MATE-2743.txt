Item #: SCP-2743

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2743 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a UV light to prevent the spread of spots. SCP-2743 must wear the LED gas mask at all times to prevent any contact or inhalation of air-borne infectious agents. Access to SCP-2743 is granted only to Level 2 personnel and above, and only for experimental purposes with prior approval by two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2743 is a human female with distinctive facial features. She has spots covering her face and neck area and sports purple lipstick. Her eyebrows are orange, and her ears have a pair of jade earrings. SCP-2743 usually wears a gold chain. She works as a beautician.

SCP-2743 displays a caring and nurturing personality, which can lead to humorous situations where she treats her friends and family as children. There have been no documented abnormal physical properties of SCP-2743, but caution must be taken to prevent any contamination of subjects.

Addendum: SCP-2743 became a part of the Foundation after several patients at her beauty salon contracted the mysterious "purple spot" disease, which caused severe hallucinations and eventually led to multiple deaths. SCP-2743 was found to be the carrier of the disease, but upon further investigation, it was revealed that she had no knowledge of it. She herself had never contracted the disease as she had been immune to it from birth. SCP-2743 was then transferred into the custody of the Foundation for containment and study.
