SCP-2394, codenamed "The Politician Rabbit," is a remarkable entity worthy of attention from the Foundation. This creature is the embodiment of wit and cunning, capable of weaving his way through any political situation with ease. SCP-2394 is a male rabbit with piercing VR rainbow LED eyes that cast a hypnotic spell on anyone that gazes into them. The cap that rests upon his head is a replica of a police cap, and his ears are bedecked with a jade earring for added flair.

SCP-2394's personality is best described as sardonic with a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. Few understand the humor that lies within the depths of his comments; however, those that have the keen wit to do so appreciate the subtle comedic elements. A cigar clamped in between his teeth, he exudes an air of mystery and confidence causing all around him to feel slightly unsettled.

The Foundation has been monitoring SCP-2394's activities closely, precisely because of its unique ability to influence the political agenda of any organization it chooses to. There have been reports of SCP-2394 causing political upheavals in rival organizations and secretly manipulating the party to gain ultimate control. The Foundation has yet to determine the extent of these influences, making containment a top priority.
