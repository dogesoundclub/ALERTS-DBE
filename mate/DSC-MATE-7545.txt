SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-7545

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7545 is to be kept in a secured facility at all times, with a designated handler authorized to provide maintenance and updates as necessary. Under no circumstances may SCP-7545 leave the facility without proper authorization from at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-7545 is a male robot of unknown origin, designed to resemble a journalist or reporter. Its one eye is a green cyclops-like feature, with lenses resembling those of ski goggles covering its lower face. SCP-7545 also wears a bucket hat on its head and a red cross earring on its left ear. When activated, SCP-7545 communicates through a synthesized voice, and its mouth is obscured by a medical mask.

SCP-7545 exhibits a personality that leans toward risk-taking and adventure-seeking. This behavior can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, such as getting lost or being seriously injured during extreme activities. When asked about its past experiences, SCP-7545 becomes evasive, leading to speculation that it may have been involved in dangerous or illegal activities before being contained by the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-7545 was recovered from a warehouse believed to have been used by a group of robotics enthusiasts. Its creators and the group's intentions remain unknown. Attempts to identify the origin of SCP-7545's unique features have been unsuccessful. It is still unknown whether SCP-7545 has the ability to act on its own accord or if it requires direction. As such, testing with SCP-7545 is considered high-risk and must be approved by the Ethics Committee.
