SCP-4509's personality is characterized by rebelliousness and a desire to push boundaries. It enjoys breaking rules or bending them just to see what happens, often resulting in humorous situations. Its position as a Mafia Boss reflects this personality trait, as it frequently engages in criminal activities that challenge the authority of established institutions.
