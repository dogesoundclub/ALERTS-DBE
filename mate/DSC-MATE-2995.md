Item #: 2995

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2995 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to Subject 2995 requires approval from at least two level 3 personnel. Subject 2995 is to be kept under constant observation for any abnormal behavior, as she has been known to display anomalous properties.

Description: Subject 2995 is a female human of average height and build. Her face is adorned with spotted skin and a vibrant purple lip. Her eyes are red clown-like eyes that seem to pierce the viewer's soul. Subject 2995’s head is adorned with vibrant green hair in a purple cap. Her ears are pierced with a red cross earring, and wears a gold chain around her neck. Her most notable feature is her normal gas mask that she wears at all times.

Subject 2995 has been known to show absent-minded behavior, often forgetting appointments or losing track of time due to being lost in thought or working on a project. This has led to some humorous situations for staff at Site-██. However, this behavior may also be a result of her anomalous properties.

Subject 2995 has exhibited an ability to manipulate time, but the extent of her powers is unknown. Testing has shown that she can cause people and objects around her to experience time differently than the rest of the world. This can result in objects appearing to move at different speeds or people feeling as if time has slowed down or sped up. 

Addendum: Recent experiments have shown that Subject 2995’s powers can be potentially dangerous if left unchecked. Further testing is required to fully understand her anomalous properties and determine how best to contain her. Any personnel who come into contact with Subject 2995 should exercise caution and be aware of her powers.
