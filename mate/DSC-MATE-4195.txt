Item #: SCP-4195

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4195 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit, with access restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. Any interaction with SCP-4195 must be supervised and recorded for analysis. SCP-4195 is allowed to maintain their job as a politician, but their activities are to be monitored at all times.

Description: SCP-4195 is a human female politician, identified by their two-color band on their forehead and gold earring on their ear. SCP-4195's most notable feature is their smile, which is often seen when they engage in conversation or public speaking. In addition, SCP-4195 is frequently seen smoking a cigarette, an accessory they seem to hold onto even when prohibited from doing so.

SCP-4195 may appear laid-back and easy-going on the surface, but they are capable of becoming fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. The Foundation has observed this behavior manifesting in heated arguments with those who insult or threaten their friends or family members. SCP-4195's personality quirks have created some interesting situations, and as such, they are not to be underestimated.

Addendum: SCP-4195 has recently shown interest in the Foundation's efforts to maintain peace and order in the world of the supernatural. Senior staff have authorized a trial partnership between SCP-4195 and the Foundation, recognizing the potential benefits of having a politician with such protective inclinations on our side. Interaction with SCP-4195 should continue to be monitored, but with the new added understanding that their loyalty could be an asset in maintaining human and anomalous cooperation.
