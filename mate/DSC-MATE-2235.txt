Description: SCP-2235 appears to be a human male of average height and build. Its distinguishing features include bright orange stripes on its cheeks, a short peak cap on its head, and a red scarf around its neck. The subject also wears normal glasses and a gold earring in its left ear. It is often seen wearing an LED gas mask over its mouth and nose.

SCP-2235 is a professional beautician, proficient in a wide variety of grooming and styling techniques. Subjects that receive treatment from SCP-2235 display a marked improvement in their physical appearance and mood. SCP-2235 has demonstrated a strong sense of independence and may exhibit resistance to authority or rules that it views as unnecessary. This can sometimes result in rebellious behavior, such as leaving work early or taking a day off without permission.

After initial contact, SCP-2235 demonstrated an eagerness to cooperate with containment and expressed a desire to continue working in a controlled environment.

Addendum 2235-B: SCP-2235 is currently undergoing cognitive and psychological evaluations to determine the extent of its anomalous properties. Further testing is planned to determine potential utility in Foundation operations.
