Description: Subject 5193 is a female human of average build and height. She is easily distinguishable by her striking purple lip color and a purple cap adorning her head with a headset. The most significant identifying feature, however, are her eyes, which emit a kaleidoscopic VR Rainbow LED light. The visual effect is unusual but poses no harm; however, caution is advised when making direct eye contact.

Subject 5193 has a strong nurturing personality that often leads her to take care of others as if they were her own. Her caring behavior is endearing, but it has also been known to result in humorous situations, such as treating adults like children or pets. It is currently unknown as to the source of her anomalous properties.

Under no circumstances should Subject 5193 be allowed access to powerful and potentially dangerous artifacts, as her caring nature may lead to unintended consequences.

Addendum: Upon further investigation, Subject 5193 was observed wearing a Silver chain, possibly linked to an unknown object. Further research must be conducted to understand the significance of the chain and any additional properties it may possess.
