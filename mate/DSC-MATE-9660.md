Item #: 9660

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9660 is to be contained within a standard humanoid humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell shall be furnished with appropriate climatic conditions to preserve the health of the creature. The individual is to be fed a diet of fresh fruits and nuts daily, with occasional live insect feeds, in order to sustain its nutritional requirements. Access to entertainment material that does not provoke the individual’s heightened emotional states is allowed at the discretion of the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-9660 appears to be a non-anomalous monkey of the species Rhesus Macaque. However, upon closer examination, it has been found that DSC-MATE-9660 displays human-like emotional characteristics such as empathy, compassion, and sensitivity. The individual stands at an approximate height of 50 cm and weighs 6.8 kg. DSC-MATE-9660 appears to prefer wearing a bucket hat, a gold chain, and a normal gas mask, and has displayed a preference for sentimental movies and music that evoke strong emotions.

DSC-MATE-9660 displays high intelligence, dexterity, and an ability to learn and imitate human behavior. Its emotional states can quickly become unstable, leading to outbursts of frustration, anger, or depression. It is extremely adept at manipulating those around it to achieve its goals, often using its non-threatening appearance to its advantage when dealing with unsuspecting personnel or civilians.

DSC-MATE-9660 was first discovered in ██████ when it was spotted mimicking the behavior of a local reporter. Its ability to mimic human behavior drew attention to it and it was apprehended by Foundation personnel. It has since been reclassified as an DSC and is being studied to determine whether these emotional characteristics can be replicated in other animals.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9660 has been observed to exhibit signs of cognitive development that suggest it has the ability to comprehend and communicate in human language. Continued observations will be conducted to determine the extent of this ability.
