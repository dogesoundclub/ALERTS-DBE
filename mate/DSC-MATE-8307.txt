SCP-8307, also known as Dr. Hopper, is a male rabbit veterinarian with a nervous disposition. He wears a red beanie on his head to keep his long, floppy ears warm and a pair of nerdy glasses to help him see. His mouth is perpetually frozen in a frightened expression, causing some individuals to speculate that he may have seen some unspeakable horrors in his line of work.

SCP-8307 possesses a unique ability to predict events before they occur, and his intuition is often mistaken for psychic powers. He has an uncanny ability to sense when others are anxious or upset, making him an invaluable asset to the Foundation. However, his abilities also make him somewhat eerie and unapproachable to those who are unfamiliar with his gift.

In addition to his unique talents, SCP-8307's forehead is adorned with a distinctive two-color band, possibly indicating some kind of tribal or cultural significance. He also wears a gold earring in one ear, which may be a nod to his adventurous and unconventional nature.

Despite his timid appearance, SCP-8307 possesses a fierce determination to help those in need, especially small and vulnerable creatures. He is an expert in veterinary medicine and has saved countless lives, both human and animal, throughout his career. Nevertheless, SCP-8307 remains somewhat of an enigma, with his mysterious abilities and intriguing appearance, making him a valuable asset to the Foundation's mission to protect the world from supernatural threats.
