Description: DSC-MATE-2560 is a male tiger manifested in the form of a car salesman. DSC-MATE-2560 has the physical appearance of an anthropomorphic tiger, bearing distinctive facial features of a frightened mouth with VR jade LED eyes. DSC-MATE-2560 also wears a red beanie atop its head with a medical mask covering its mouth.

DSC-MATE-2560 demonstrates a unique personality characteristic of being very introspective, often lost in deep thought or daydreaming. This trait sometimes tends to cause humorous situations, such as accidentally tripping over objects or walking into poles while being lost in thought.

DSC-MATE-2560 possesses anomalous abilities to persuade and manipulate other individuals in purchasing vehicles from its dealership. Its voice and speech characteristics are disproportionately effective in convincing individuals to make purchases regardless of financial or situational circumstances.

DSC-MATE-2560's anomalous abilities seem to be facilitated by its mesmerizing VR jade LED eyes, which seem to entice the individual into a trance-like state.

Addendum 2560-1: DSC-MATE-2560 was first discovered within a dealership located in ██████, with a record-breaking sales volume averaging almost triple of any other dealership in the area. Upon initial investigation, production equipment and programming for the immersive advertising media were outfitted with anomalous technology suggesting tampering by an outside party.

Further investigation showed links to a covert organization similar to the Global Occult Coalition, highlighting the need for discretion in all dealings with DSC-MATE-2560. As of writing, the origin of DSC-MATE-2560 remains unknown.
