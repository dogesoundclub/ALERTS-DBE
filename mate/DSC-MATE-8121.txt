SCP-8121 is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on his face. He works as a train driver and has been observed to take his duty and responsibility seriously. Despite this, he also knows how to let loose and have fun, often bringing laughter and joy to those around him.

SCP-8121's most notable accessory is a red scarf, which he dons proudly along with normal glasses. He also carries a candy stick, which he will often offer to those around him as a gesture of goodwill.

Perhaps what sets SCP-8121 apart from others is his two-color band on his forehead, which seems to grant him some level of protection against anomalous phenomena. However, further study is required to fully understand this aspect of his appearance.

Overall, SCP-8121 is a refreshing presence, balancing the weight of responsibility with the need for enjoyment in a way that few can manage. He is a valuable member of any team and should be treated with the utmost respect and care.
