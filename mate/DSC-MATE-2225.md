Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2225 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. She is to be provided access to veterinary facilities and all necessary equipment for her profession. She is not to be allowed access to any improvised devices or materials outside of normal work duties.

Description: Item #2225 is a human female with orange stripes on the face and red lips. She has blue clown eyes and wears a purple cap with a headset. She also has a gold earring and gold chain. She is a practical and hands-on individual, known to employ unconventional solutions to otherwise complicated problems. She has been identified as a veterinarian and displays expert knowledge in animal medical care.

Addendum: Item #2225's use of makeshift solutions has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in the containment and care of DSC objects. However, her desire to fix things in unconventional ways may pose a threat to the proper containment of certain DSC objects. Therefore, it is important to monitor her actions carefully and provide supervision when necessary.
