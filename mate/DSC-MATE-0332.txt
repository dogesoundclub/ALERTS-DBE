Item #: SCP-332

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-332 is currently residing in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-19. The chamber is to be checked for any abnormalities or tampering on a weekly basis. SCP-332 is allowed access to designing materials and tools upon request but all possessions are to be screened for potential anomalous properties.

SCP-332 is to wear a gas mask at all times when interacting with Foundation personnel or attempting to leave their containment chamber. Any breaches of this protocol should be reported immediately to on-duty personnel.

Description: SCP-332 is a humanoid of the female sex, standing at 5'7" and weighing approximately 125lbs. SCP-332's most notable physical features include orange stripes on the cheeks and red lips. SCP-332 has 90s brown hair and green cross earrings. SCP-332 is often seen wearing a gold chain necklace.

SCP-332 is a fashion designer by profession and has a meticulous attention to detail, sometimes bordering on obsessive behavior. SCP-332's obsession with organization and color-coding has been observed in various aspects of their life, including their spice rack and closet.

SCP-332's gas mask is a standard issue and is believed to be a precautionary item to prevent SCP-332's anomalous abilities from manifesting. It is suspected that SCP-332's anomalous qualities may be linked to their attention to detail.

Addendum: Incident Report 332-01 - On ██/██/20██, SCP-332 entered a distressed state and began to rapidly organize their containment chamber. The objects in their room began to levitate and move under SCP-332's command. SCP-332's gas mask was quickly secured onto their face by on-duty personnel, effectively neutralizing SCP-332's anomalous abilities. SCP-332 has not exhibited any anomalous behavior since the incident. Testing and observation will continue.
