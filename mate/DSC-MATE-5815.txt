Item #: SCP-5815

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5815 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to her profession, SCP-5815 is to be provided with a workbench and equipment for the purpose of repairing electrical appliances. SCP-5815 must not be allowed to tamper with any electrical components beyond her assigned tasks.

Description: SCP-5815 is a female human of approximately 35 years of age. She stands roughly 170 cm tall and weighs approximately 60 kg. SCP-5815's most notable features are her orange striped face and bright orange eyebrow eyes. She wears a tiara on her head, adorned with gold earrings and a pair of goggles on her forehead.

SCP-5815 presents with a kind and empathetic personality, exhibiting a deep understanding of others. She is easily moved to tears or emotional outbursts when presented with scenes of pain and suffering. Additionally, SCP-5815 has shown remarkable fondness for animals and nature, often spending her free time tending to plants or feeding stray animals.

Aside from these distinctive qualities, SCP-5815 is a competent electrician and is capable of repairing a variety of electronic devices. She is often seen smoking a cigarette while working, though it has been noted that she never smokes in the presence of others.

SCP-5815 came under Foundation custody in 20██ after local authorities reported strange behavior exhibited by the electrician while repairing electrical systems in various public buildings across the city. Upon investigation, it was discovered that SCP-5815's abilities extended beyond normal human electromagnetic sensitivity.

Addendum: Despite several attempts to ascertain any anomalous properties or phenomena related to SCP-5815, no unusual activity has been observed. SCP-5815's ability to repair electronic devices has been determined to occur through purely mundane means. However, her emotional sensitivity and compassion are deemed unusual and warrant further study.
