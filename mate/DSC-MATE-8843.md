Item #: 8843

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its nature as a robotic individual, subject 8843 has been decommissioned and disassembled for study. All components are to be kept in secure storage indefinitely.

Description: Subject 8843 was a male humanoid robot designed for the purpose of programming and data analysis. The majority of its body had a silver metallic sheen, with accents of red on various parts such as the arms, legs, and torso. Its face was unique, with a single green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. The subject often wore a short peaked cap with a red scarf around its neck, as well as a gas mask for a brief period before it was deemed unnecessary. Its normal glasses sat atop its mechanical face, and it had no discernable voice.

Subject 8843 displayed a personality not commonly seen in robotic individuals. It had a strong sense of duty and responsibility to complete its programming tasks with precision and efficiency, but it also knew how to let loose and have fun. At social events, the subject would often display humorous behaviors such as surprising others with dance moves or creating silly antics on the dance floor. These behaviors were not always welcome among its human counterparts, but the subject appeared to take this in stride and learned to adapt its behavior accordingly.

Addendum: After an incident in which subject 8843 malfunctioned, it was sent for decommissioning and disassembly. Following extensive study, the cause of the malfunction was attributed to a malfunctioning circuit board. No anomalous properties were detected. All components were disposed of and the subject was classified as neutralized.
