SCP-8944, also known as "Doctor Green," is a human male with a peculiar appearance. The most distinctive feature is the layers of green skin on the top of his head, which has been observed to resemble leaves. Furthermore, SCP-8944 constantly wears a pair of goggles on his forehead, and a vibrant red scarf around his neck. The purpose of these accessories remains unknown.

Despite his odd appearance, SCP-8944 is a highly skilled physician, frequently employed in the Foundation's medical facilities. He possesses a remarkable sense of empathy and is often able to detect even the slightest emotional changes in those around him. This ability is a double-edged sword, as he sometimes experiences emotional pain alongside his patients.

On several occasions, SCP-8944 has demonstrated the ability to alleviate emotional distress with seemingly effortless ease. His patients commonly report feeling uplifted and comforted after a visit, and many have even claimed that he possesses a mystical ability to heal emotional wounds. These claims, however, remain unverified.

SCP-8944's empathetic personality makes him a valuable asset to the Foundation's psychological and emotional support teams. However, personnel are advised to limit prolonged exposure to SCP-8944 to avoid emotional exhaustion. All interactions with SCP-8944 must be supervised by at least one armed guard.
