SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-9833

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9833 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell must include a personalized workstation, as SCP-9833 requires access to programming software to perform daily tasks. Furthermore, a constant supply of candy sticks must be provided to ensure psychological stability. Personnel are advised to avoid conversing with SCP-9833 regarding its hobbies or interests.

SCP-9833 displays highly imaginative and creative tendencies, often engaging in unusual hobbies and interests. It has shown a particular affinity for poetry, cosplay, and collecting esoteric items. However, its creativity often manifests in unpredictable and erratic ways, leading to potential containment breaches.

SCP-9833 is proficient in programming languages and is capable of designing and implementing complex systems. Its creativity in this field has proven valuable in assisting with certain Foundation projects. However, its volatile nature is a potential threat to both staff and containment.

Addendum: After Incident-9833-B, all conversations with SCP-9833 regarding its interests or hobbies are strictly prohibited. SCP-9833's candy intake is to be monitored closely, and any sign of withdrawal or aggression must be reported immediately.
