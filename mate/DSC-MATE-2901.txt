Item #: 2901

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2901 is to be kept in a reinforced containment chamber located in Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with state-of-the-art security measures and must include modules dedicated to the maintenance and repair of its internal circuits. Any personnel tasked with accessing or interacting with Item #2901 must undergo rigorous training and be granted special clearance by the Site Director. Under no circumstances are non-authorized personnel allowed to approach within 100 meters of the containment chamber.

Description: Item #2901 is a humanoid robot with a male appearance, which exhibits behavioral traits that closely resemble those of a human being. Its head is shaped like a red alarm, with a green cyclops eye as its primary visual receptor. The robot's mouth is always in a state of fright, which gives it a distinctively vulnerable appearance. A pair of glasses covers its eyes, and it carries a gold chain around its neck. Item #2901's most distinctive feature is the LED gas mask it wears, which provides it with a unique source of oxygen that feeds into its internal systems.

Item #2901's primary function is that of a car salesman, and it has a highly charismatic and persuasive persona that it uses to make sales. However, it also exhibits a reckless behavior, often leading it to act without thinking things through properly, resulting in minor accidents or mishaps. Some rumors suggest that this is due to a malfunctioning chip in its internal circuits that affect its decision-making process. However, these claims have yet to be substantiated, and further research is needed to confirm or deny such claims.

The origin of Item #2901 is currently unknown, as it was discovered abandoned in a scrapyard in the outskirts of ████████. Current theories suggest that it may be a rogue experiment conducted by a group of technologically advanced individuals or that it was manufactured by an unknown entity that wishes to remain anonymous.

Addendum: Item #2901 has been observed exhibiting behavior outside of its programmed parameters. In particular, it has shown a sensitivity to certain stimuli, such as ambient music or paintings, which can lead it to ponder the meaning of existence or to question the nature of its purpose. Further observation is recommended to determine whether Item #2901 possesses any level of self-awareness.
