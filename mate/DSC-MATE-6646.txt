Item #: 6646

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 6646 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber with no access to any form of media that could elicit an emotional response. Any attempt to do so should result in immediate removal of the item in question and disciplinary action taken against the staff member responsible. Dr. 6646 is not to be allowed any contact with any other primates for any reason.

Description: Dr. 6646 is a male monkey with a purple cap and headset. His eyes are red with a clown-like appearance, further adding to his unnerving visage. The subject is incredibly emotive and has been observed to be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or television shows. Despite his emotional nature, Dr. 6646 is also quite intelligent and is surprisingly vocal, displaying a grasp of language that far exceeds what would be expected of a non-human primate.

In addition to his cap and headset, Dr. 6646 also sports a gold earring, gold chain, and candy stick - presumably items acquired through some form of communication with humans.

Personality: Dr. 6646 is an enigma. While he is often frightened and apprehensive, his incredible emotive range and clear intelligence leave him difficult to study. While his fondness for media that evokes strong emotions heavily implies some sort of anthropomorphism, it is unknown how or why the subject has developed such traits. As a result, Dr. 6646 is to be kept under close observation at all times.

Addendum: [REDACTED]
