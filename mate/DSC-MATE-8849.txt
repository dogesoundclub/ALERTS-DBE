SCP Foundation file designation number 8849 designates a unique entity in the form of a male rabbit. With a pair of ski goggles for eyes and a purple cap adorned with a headset, the creature is easily distinguishable in a crowd. The unusual species of this entity, combined with its gaudy accessories, immediately draws attention wherever it goes.

But what makes 8849 even more curious is its personality. The entity is unusually idealistic, with a deep-seated desire to make the world a better place. This characteristic can lead the entity to behave in ways that some might consider humorous. For instance, it may start protesting or boycotting a company or cause that it feels goes against its values.

The entity often carries a gold chain and a candy stick, adding to its distinct individuality. 8849's jade earring further sets it apart, as it's often found chatting with high-ranking officials in the banking industry. As a banker by profession, the entity is believed to have insider knowledge and significant resources on its side.

To date, there is little solid information on attitudes, intentions, or abilities of 8849, but due to its unusual display of idealistic behaviors, the entity has been added to high-priority observation list for the SCP. Further investigations are needed to uncover 8849's underlying motive, and the SCP Foundation is seeking all the necessary resources to unravel the truth.
