Item #: 2764

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2764 is to be supervised at all times during interactions with non-foundation personnel. Subject is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber and provided with beauty products for personal grooming. Any artistic or emotional stimuli given to the subject must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel. 

Description: Subject 2764 is a female human with spotted facial features and a bright, infectious smile. Her most peculiar feature is her clown-like, red eyes often accentuated with heavy makeup application. Her head is a metallic blue, and she sports goggles on her forehead and gold earrings on her ears. Subject's neck is often adorned with a choker, which is speculated to possess anomalous properties. 

Subject 2764's primary role is a beautician, but she often finds herself moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies, TV shows, or any audiovisual representation that evokes strong emotions. These moments are often amplified by her unusual ability to generate intense feelings by simple proximity, making her a potential danger to unprepared individuals.  

Addendum: Subject 2764 seems unaware of her own abilities and often finds herself questioning why she feels an overwhelming range of emotions whenever she meets someone new. Further research is needed to determine if her emotional sensitivity is a natural occurrence or the result of an unknown anomalous event.
