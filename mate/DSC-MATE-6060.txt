Item #: SCP-6060

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6060 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with ample space for movement. Accessory items are to remain on the subject at all times, with the exception of testing procedures. SCP-6060 is to receive regular medical and psychological evaluations to ensure both physical and mental health. All interaction with SCP-6060 is to be supervised by no fewer than two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-6060 appears to be a rabbit of the Leporidae family, standing at 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall when standing on its hind legs. SCP-6060 is male, with jade LED eyes that occasionally flicker, and a gold earring in its left ear. It is usually seen wearing a red scarf. SCP-6060 exhibits traits and mannerisms similar to that of a human, including communication through speech and tool use capabilities. It also displays a strong sense of independence and a rebellious nature towards authority and rules.

Personality: SCP-6060 has shown to possess a strong sense of independence, frequently resisting authority and rules that it deems unnecessary. This trait can lead to rebellious behavior such as sneaking out of containment chambers or taking unauthorized leave. Despite this, SCP-6060 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel and has shown affection towards those it has formed relationships with.

Addendum: SCP-6060 was recovered from a farm in rural Iowa, where it was discovered that SCP-6060 had been tending to the farm in the absence of the farmer. SCP-6060 was successful in maintaining the crops and livestock, leading researchers to conclude that its rebellious nature may stem from a desire to maintain autonomy over its own life. Further observation and testing is ongoing.
