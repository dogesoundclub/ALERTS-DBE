Item #: 7989

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7989 is to be monitored by Foundation staff, but no physical restraint is necessary at this time. The subject may continue to work as a Reporter, but must follow strict guidelines to ensure that they do not cause a potential security breach.

Description: Item 7989 is a human female with striking facial features, including orange stripes and purple lips. Her hair is styled in a 90s fashion, and she wears a green cross earring in her left ear. Item 7989 routinely wears a medical mask, potentially to conceal their scent from supernatural entities. 

Personality-wise, Item 7989 is highly empathetic and compassionate, often putting the well-being of others before their own. They have a tendency to take on other people's problems as if it is their own, leading to a feeling of responsibility for even the most impossible problems. Despite this quirk, their altruistic nature makes them a valuable asset to Foundation operations. 

Addendum: Foundation staff must remain vigilant around Item 7989, as their empathy may make them susceptible to manipulation by rogue entities. If Item 7989 comes into contact with Foundation-sensitive information, they may pose a potential security risk. As such, it is highly recommended that staff maintain professional boundaries when interacting with this subject.
