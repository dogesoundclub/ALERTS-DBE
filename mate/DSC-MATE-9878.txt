SCP-9878, also known as "The Manager," is a male monkey of unknown origin, currently working as a theater manager in the downtown area. Despite his unexpected appearance and occupation, The Manager has proven himself to be a competent employee with a unique personality.

The most striking feature of The Manager is his red clown eyes, which seem to be permanently fixed in a cheerful expression. He wears a Doge hat on his head and a jade earring on one ear, which could indicate he may have some penchant for vanity. He also wears a silver chain and carries a whistle around his neck.

As a person, The Manager is incredibly idealistic and can be seen as an activist in his own right. He has a strong desire to make the world a better place and sticks to his values even in small matters. He will not hesitate to protest or boycott a company or cause that he feels goes against his ideals, even if it means putting his job at risk.

It is unclear whether The Manager possesses any supernatural abilities or if his appearance is a result of exposure to anomalous energies. He has not shown any violent tendencies but may exhibit a mischievous streak at times, such as hiding props or pranking staff members. 

Containment procedures for The Manager are currently unnecessary, and he is allowed to continue with his life as a theater manager. However, he should be monitored for any changes in his behavior or if he shows signs of any dangerous abilities.
