Description: 2907 appears to be a human male in his late 20s. He currently holds a position as a Firefighter in a local Fire department. 2907 is easily recognizable due to the distinct mouth spot above his upper lip. Furthermore, he is often seen wearing a short peak cap and a silver chain around his neck. On certain occasions, 2907 has been observed to be wearing a green cross earring which appears identical to the Maltese cross or fire cross.

2907's most notable feature is, however, the LED gas mask he sometimes wears. The mask, which is believed to have been created by 2907 himself, provides its user with various sensor readings and information analysis of the surrounding environment. It is unclear how 2907 obtained the knowledge for the construction of the mask, but reports suggest that it might have been obtained through anomalous means.

The personality of 2907 is also worth noting. He is empathetic by nature and often shows a strong affinity in detecting the emotions of others. His kind and compassionate demeanor have led him to be well-liked among his friends and colleagues. 2907 is often known to use humor as a coping mechanism to make light of difficult situations or to cheer others up.

Addendum: 2907's anomalous abilities seem to be currently limited to the creation of his LED gas mask. Further research is required to identify the source of his anomalous knowledge and to explore the extent of his abilities.
