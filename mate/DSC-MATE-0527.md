Item #: 527

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 527 is to be monitored at all times during work hours to ensure that they are adhering to their delivery driver duties. Any deviation from their assigned route or behavior outside of their usual work habits must be reported immediately to the appropriate authority. However, outside of work hours, subject 527 is allowed to engage in recreational activities as long as they don't breach any of the Foundation's rules or laws. 

Description: 

Subject 527 is a human male with pink parted hair and gold earrings. The subject also possesses an orange striped facial feature with a frightened mouth that makes them stand out from others. While on the job, subject 527 can be seen with a gold chain and carrying a candy stick at all times. 

Subject 527 has a strong sense of responsibility and takes their job very seriously. They are prompt, reliable, and competent in their role as a delivery driver. However, subject 527 is not just all work and no play. When off the clock, they love to have fun and show off their dance moves to others, even if it means making a fool of themselves. 

Despite subject 527's seemingly harmless nature, the Foundation is keeping a close eye on their behavior. There is a possibility that subject 527 will attract unwanted attention due to their unusual appearance and erratic behavior. Until further notice, subject 527 is to remain employed by the Foundation to monitor their activity closely. 

Addendum: As of Date [REDACTED] , subject 527 has been reassigned to the Special Delivery Unit due to their exceptional work ethic and adherence to Foundation protocol. Subject 527 will now undergo further observations in their new role to determine their suitability for future assignments.
