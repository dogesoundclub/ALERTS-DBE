SCP Foundation Containment Report:

Identification number 1192, also known as the "Electrician," is a human of unknown age and origin. Their distinguishing features include VR Jade LED eyes, an Orange Side head, and Green Cross Earring ears. The subject is often seen wearing a choker and smoking cigarettes.

1192's primary job is that of an electrician, using their unique abilities to manipulate electricity to aid in their work. However, they also possess a love for adventure, often taking risks and trying new experiences. This leads to some humorous incidents, such as surviving a near-death bungee jumping experience or getting lost in the wilderness.

Agents are advised to use caution when interacting with 1192, as their thrill-seeking tendencies may lead to reckless behavior. It is unknown if there are any adverse effects to prolonged exposure to their electrical abilities. Further study is necessary to fully understand the extent of their capabilities. Until then, they are to be contained in a secure facility and monitored closely.
