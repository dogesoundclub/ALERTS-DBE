SCP-3755, known as "The Anchorman", is a human female news anchor with blue clown eyes that seem to twinkle with a mischievous energy. Her not arranged green hair frames her face, highlighting her prominent smile which never seems to leave her lips. Despite her cheerful disposition, she always wears a medical mask, perhaps as a precaution or a reminder of the chaotic world in which she lives. 

SCP-3755 is often seen wearing a choker around her neck, adding a somewhat rebellious touch to her conservative work attire. Her strong sense of duty and responsibility, paired with her infectious enthusiasm, make her a valuable member of any team. However, this dedication can also lead to some rather amusing situations when she tries to take on too much at once.

Approach with caution as it is unclear what SCP-3755's true intentions are, but be prepared for a contagious smile and boundless energy.
