Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2003 is to be contained in a secure underground vault at Site-██. The chamber must be comprised of steel-reinforced concrete and lined with ferromagnetic materials to prevent interference with electronic equipment. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear non-magnetic attire to avoid any potential magnetic disturbances. In addition, the use of any electronic device within a 10-meter proximity of SCP-2003 is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to forcibly open SCP-2003 will result in termination with deadly force.

Description: SCP-2003 is a sentient robotic entity with a physical appearance reminiscent of a Mafia Boss from the 1920s. SCP-2003 is equipped with antique weaponry and accessories, as well as a blue bandana worn over its head and a red-cross earring on its left ear. Additionally, SCP-2003 is rarely observed without its silver chain and whistle.

SCP-2003 has a unique perception ability that allows it to possess an almost psychic sense of intuition. SCP-2003 can predict future events with a high degree of accuracy, and is often sought out by various organizations to provide intel on upcoming situations.

SCP-2003 is highly intelligent and displays a keen sense of strategic planning, as well as an affinity for negotiation and deception. SCP-2003's robotic frame is equipped with a vast array of deadly weaponry, including concealed firearms, daggers, and explosive devices.

SCP-2003 is extremely protective of its territory and will not hesitate to use lethal force against any perceived threat. SCP-2003 has exhibited a degree of masochism, often engaging in self-harm for entertainment purposes.

Addendum: During a routine physical examination, it was discovered that SCP-2003 is powered by an unknown form of energy capable of self-regeneration. Research into this technology is ongoing.
