Item #: 9564

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9564 was a human male with no anomalous properties or risk to Foundation secrecy. Therefore, no containment procedures are necessary.

Description: Item 9564, or "Delivery Driver," was a man of average height and build, with parted pink hair that was dyed pink. His most notable physical features included a small spot near the left corner of his mouth and a constant smile. He wore a green cross earring on his left ear and a gold chain around his neck. He was often seen smoking a cigarette.

Personality-wise, he was highly observant and detail-oriented, making him an exceptional gift-giver. He had a talent for finding the perfect present for each person, but he often became overly concerned about making sure it was the absolute best gift possible. This would lead to him agonizing over what to get for hours on end.

Note: Item 9564 was recruited for the Foundation under the guise of a regular delivery driver at the local pizza shop. His skills in gift-giving were deemed useful for undercover operations, and he was utilized as such until his retirement.
