Item #: SCP-1696

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1696 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All communications with SCP-1696 must be carried out through a speaker and monitored at all times. Testing with SCP-1696 must have prior approval from at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1696 appears to be a human female of South Asian descent, with spots on her face and a noticeable smile. She wears normal glasses and has a green haircut with edge curl. SCP-1696 regularly wears a jade earring on her right ear and a silver chain around her neck. Furthermore, SCP-1696 uses an LED gas mask as an accessory, as it has been proven to have a calming effect on her personality.

SCP-1696 is a lawyer in the San Francisco Bay Area, known for her idealistic and altruistic perception of the world. SCP-1696 is known to propagate her views and vigorously participate in peaceful protests and boycotts to promote her values. It has led to SCP-1696's involvement in several political actions, giving her prominence in the Bay Area's political landscape.

SCP-1696's testing has revealed that she is incredibly intelligent, with an IQ of 150, and possesses analytical, critical, and creative thinking abilities, making her a useful asset for the Foundation.

SCP-1696's idealistic demeanor makes it challenging to identify her motives and intentions in the case of an information breach or containment breach. SCP-1696 cannot be coaxed into divulging classified information, making her an enigmatic figure in the Foundation. 

Addendum: Although SCP-1696 has expressed love for humanity, monitoring of her online behavior has revealed a deep-seated disdain for authority figures and an attraction to several underground movements. As such, SCP-1696's containment must be of absolute priority.
