Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8265 is to be assigned to urban delivery routes only, with monitoring equipment installed in the vehicle to ensure compliance with standard shipping procedures. DSC-MATE-8265 is to be authorized for deliveries up to 100 pounds, with no exceptions.

DSC-MATE-8265's potential for impulsive behavior should be carefully managed. If DSC-MATE-8265 exhibits any indication of loss of self-control or extraordinary strength, immediately contact the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-8265 is a human male with multiple distinguishing features. DSC-MATE-8265's skin has numerous dark spots of varying sizes and shapes, most prominently on the face, neck, and upper arms. DSC-MATE-8265's goggles have replaced his natural eyes, providing excellent clarity and augmented vision in low-light conditions.

DSC-MATE-8265 wears a gold chain that has been tested for magical or alchemical properties. Results have been inconclusive.

DSC-MATE-8265 has exhibited some impulsive tendencies, often acting on emotions rather than rational thought. DSC-MATE-8265's decision-making process may seem spontaneous, sometimes leading to unexpected consequences. These traits have been shown to make DSC-MATE-8265 a likable and relatable individual, which could be used to our advantage.

In the event of containment breaches, DSC-MATE-8265's unique abilities can assist in the retrieval of other anomalous items. However, caution is advised when working with DSC-MATE-8265, and all interactions should be observed and cataloged for further study.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8265's daily log suggests a preference for similarly anomalous individuals during personal contact, indicating possible latent abilities for detecting other DSCs. Further research is required to confirm these findings.
