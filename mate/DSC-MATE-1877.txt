Subject 1877 is a human female, approximately 27 years of age. The subject is a veterinarian by profession and has never displayed any anomalous behavior or abilities. However, the subject exhibits unusual physical characteristics, such as spots on her face and a purple lip.

The subject wears normal glasses and has a witch short hairstyle. The subject's ears feature a gold earring, and she is often seen wearing a silver chain accessory. Another accessory of note is the subject's regular use of cigarettes.
