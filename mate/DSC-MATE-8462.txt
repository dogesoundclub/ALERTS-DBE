Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8462 is to be monitored for any signs of abnormal behavior. Any reports of reckless behavior or potential harm to themselves or others must be immediately reported to the containment team. SCP-8462 is not allowed to operate any vehicles or participate in any high-risk activities without proper supervision.

Description: SCP-8462 is a human female identified as a news anchor for a local news station. SCP-8462 exhibits orange stripes on their face and orange eyebrows, which are said to change colors depending on the emotional state of SCP-8462. Their head is often seen wearing a hoodie and adorned with a silver chain that has yet to show any anomalous effects.

SCP-8462's personality is described as impulsive and reckless. They often act before thinking things through, leading to humorous situations that are often unintentional. While SCP-8462's recklessness may seem harmless, it can lead to potentially dangerous situations for themselves and those around them.

SCP-8462 has not shown any signs of anomalous ability besides their unique physical appearance and personality traits. However, further research and monitoring are necessary to ensure the safety of SCP-8462 and those around them.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8462 was involved in a minor car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. SCP-8462 was placed on probation and ordered to attend alcohol education classes. SCP-8462's continued recklessness may require stricter containment measures in the future.
