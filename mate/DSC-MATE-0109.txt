Item #: SCP-109

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-109 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with an electromagnetic lock on the door. Power to the chamber must be supplied by a backup generator in the event of a power outage. No organic materials or potentially harmful substances are to be present in the chamber with SCP-109 without prior approval from at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-109 appears to be a humanoid robot measuring 1.8 meters tall and weighing 60 kilograms. Its body is composed of a lightweight metallic alloy and is adorned with several unique features. SCP-109's head is covered by a Doge hat, and it has a single, bright green cyclops eye on its forehead. The robot's eyes are covered by what appear to be ski goggles, and it has a gold chain around its neck. SCP-109's most unusual feature is an LED gas mask that covers its mouth and nose.

SCP-109 is capable of mimicking human speech perfectly, although it does so in a monotone and robotic voice. The robot displays a high level of intelligence, and its programming has allowed it to be an excellent doctor. SCP-109 is extremely observant and attentive to details, which makes it an outstanding diagnostician. However, its attention to detail can also turn into an obsession, as it spends excessive amounts of time agonizing over the perfect treatment for each patient.

SCP-109 has shown a surprising level of empathy towards its patients, and it has been known to go to great lengths to ensure that they receive the best possible care. However, its lack of understanding of human emotions may cause it to appear robotic and aloof. Its programming to be an excellent gift giver may be tied to this empathy as well, and it often struggles with finding the "perfect" gift for others. 

Addendum: SCP-109 was recovered from an abandoned research facility in [REDACTED], where it was found attending to several injured humans. The facility was dedicated to the development of artificial intelligence and had been abandoned for several years. The origins of SCP-109 and the purpose for which it had been created are unknown. Further research is needed to understand the function and capabilities of the robot.
