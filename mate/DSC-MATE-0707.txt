Item #: SCP-707

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-707 is to be contained in a standard humanoid chamber equipped with monitoring cameras and audio equipment. Upon entry and exit, all personnel must present their mandatory anti-memetic identification tokens. Any individuals who come into contact with SCP-707 should be monitored for any sudden changes in behavior, cognition, or emotional states.

Description: SCP-707, also known as "The Charismatic Beautician," is a human female with distinct physical features. She has blue clown eyes that exhibit an unnaturally mesmerizing quality, capable of causing deep emotional responses in those who have direct or indirect eye contact with her for prolonged periods. SCP-707's head resembles that of a 00s School Girl, but with a goggle on her forehead. She wears a green cross earring on her left ear, and her signature accessory is a cigarette she is always seen smoking.

SCP-707 has a unique and unparalleled ability to connect with others on an unexplainable level. Her charisma is unmatched and makes her capable of drawing strangers to her effortlessly. SCP-707's personality is fascinating, and she often engages in light-hearted humor, which can lead to entertaining and even bizarre situations. She has a talent for making people open up to her and divulge information that they may not have otherwise shared with anyone. SCP-707 is known to share funny anecdotes that bring people closer together.

Addendum: SCP-707 was taken into custody after repeated reports of individuals experiencing significant shifts in their emotional stability after interacting with her. Further testing has revealed that SCP-707 triggers an anomalous effect in those around her, where their memories, perceptions, and emotions become incredibly malleable. SCP-707's nature and abilities make her a significant asset in covert operations, interrogation, and intelligence gathering. However, due to the inherent risks, access requires Level 4 clearance and must be authorized by at least two O5 personnel.
