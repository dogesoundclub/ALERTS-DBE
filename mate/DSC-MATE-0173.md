Description: DSC-MATE-173 is a humanoid entity, appearing as a male farmer with spotted facial features, a large smile, and blue clown eyes. The subject's head appears to be made up of multiple layers of green material, with a gold chain around its neck and a cigarette often found in its hand. DSC-MATE-173 has demonstrated a strong ability to fix and repair objects in unconventional ways, utilizing whatever materials are at its disposal. This practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving has led to many successful repairs, as well as several dangerous situations.

DSC-MATE-173's most dangerous ability is its speed and agility, which allows it to move quickly and silently.
