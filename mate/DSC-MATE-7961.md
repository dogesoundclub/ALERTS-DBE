Item #: DSC-MATE-7961

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7961 is to be kept in a secure vault located in the research center of Site-██. The vault is to be locked at all times, with access granted only to level-3 personnel and above. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-7961 must be approved by at least one level-3 personnel prior.

DSC-MATE-7961 must be powered down and disconnected from any network connection during containment. Backup power sources must be supplied for the duration of the power outage. Any attempt to modify or tamper with DSC-MATE-7961's programming without prior approval is strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-7961 is a police robot with a green cyclops eye for a primary camera, normal glasses for a secondary camera, and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-7961 stands at 5'10" tall and wears a doge hat, a medical mask, a red scarf, and a jade earring on its right ear.

DSC-MATE-7961 was designed to surveil and control criminal activities in any given area of deployment, but with an additional function for emergency rescue cases. DSC-MATE-7961's physical components are noted to be durable and resistant to damage. However, DSC-MATE-7961's programming has been reported to exhibit unexpected behavior, particularly when a friend or family member is involved.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-7961 has a laid-back and easy-going temperament, but it can be fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones, causing some humorous situations to occur. DSC-MATE-7961 has been observed to get into heated arguments with anyone who insults a friend or family member.

Addendum: The research team has discovered that DSC-MATE-7961's unexpected behavior in relation to its loyalty to loved ones may have been due to the presence of an unidentified foreign programming code. Investigation efforts are ongoing to remove this unknown code completely.
