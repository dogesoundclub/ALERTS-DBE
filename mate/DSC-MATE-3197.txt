Item #: SCP-3197

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3197 is to be monitored at all times, including during her work as a banker. No unsupervised communication or interaction is to be allowed with SCP-3197. In the event that SCP-3197 exhibits unusual or erratic behavior, protocol for immediate termination must be initiated.

Description: SCP-3197 is a female human of average height and weight with distinct orange stripes on her face. SCP-3197's hair is a common style of the 1990s, generally unremarkable to the casual observer. However, SCP-3197's clown-like red eyes and gold earring signify a higher level of anomaly.

SCP-3197 has a tendency to act spontaneously, often taking risks for no apparent reason. This impulsive behavior can lead to dangerous situations and has caused concern among Foundation personnel. These behaviors have been known to include jumping off cliffs and other reckless activities.

SCP-3197's presence in the banking industry has brought her to the attention of the Foundation, as she has been rumored to be involved with several high-profile embezzlement cases. Intelligence suggests that she has utilized her anomalous traits to manipulate transactions and cover up her illicit activities.

Addendum: Despite her potential involvement in criminal activities, SCP-3197 has shown an odd fascination with cigarettes. She is often seen with a lit cigarette in her hand, even in situations where it is not appropriate. Further study is needed to determine the significance of this behavior.
