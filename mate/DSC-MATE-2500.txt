Interview Log:

Interviewer: Doctor ██████████
Subject: SCP-2500

Dr. ██████████: Good morning, SCP-2500. Can you tell me a bit about your routine as a veterinarian?

SCP-2500: Of course, Doctor. I wake up at 6 a.m. and have a cup of coffee before driving to the clinic. I check on my patients and team before starting my day of appointments.

Dr. ██████████: I see. How do you handle unexpected situations or changes in your routine?

SCP-2500: It can be difficult for me, Doctor. I like to have everything planned and organized. However, I am always prepared for emergencies and have a backup plan in place.

Dr. ██████████: That's good to hear, SCP-2500. Can you tell me about any recent challenges you encountered?

SCP-2500: Well, we had a power outage last week during surgery. I had to rely on my instincts and training to finish the procedure in the dark. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but we managed to get through it.

Dr. ██████████: Thank you for your time, SCP-2500. That will be all for now.
