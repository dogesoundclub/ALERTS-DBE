Item #: SCP-7366

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7366 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with pink walls and a goggle rack. The VR Jade LED eyes are to be removed and stored separately when SCP-7366 is not under observation. Personnel are reminded that SCP-7366 is still capable of practicing law and have appropriate clearance when seeking legal aid.

Description: SCP-7366 is a humanoid specimen identified as a male lawyer. It stands at an approximate height of 175cm and has distinguishing characteristics such as a mouth spot and a constant smile. SCP-7366's eyes are typically digitally enhanced with VR Jade LED technology, and it has a distinctive parted pink hairstyle. Additionally, it has a gold earring on the left ear and often wears goggles on its forehead as an accessory.

SCP-7366 is a highly analytical and logical entity, known to enjoy engaging in debates and arguments with others for entertainment. Its arguments can often escalate and engage in heated exchanges, leading to humorous situations that other parties find trivial or unimportant. SCP-7366's legal competency remains intact, despite its anomalous characteristics.

SCP-7366 was acquired from the legal world where it had built a reputation for itself. Due to its anomalous properties, the Foundation intervened in its practice and recruited it into containment.

Addendum-7366-A: SCP-7366 has been reviewed for reclassification to Euclid after incident #7366-A. On ██/██/20██, SCP-7366 instigated a legal battle with the Foundation over its own containment, citing that the Foundation was falsely imprisoning it. The case has been settled in favor of the Foundation. SCP-7366 was reprimanded and reminded of its status as an SCP object.
