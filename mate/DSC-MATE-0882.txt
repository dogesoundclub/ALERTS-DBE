SCP-882 is a human who serves as a doctor within the Foundation. Despite their profession, they possess a distinct and unusual appearance that sets them apart from the typical worker. SCP-882's face is marked by a unique mouth spot, accompanied by a frightened expression that persists through their features. Their VR Jade LED eyes give off a distinct robotic feel, but coupled with the red beanie that covers its head adds a human touch. SCP-882's forehead is equipped with a goggle - either for medical or recreational purposes - that rests atop their forehead. 

These traits would make SCP-882 stand out enough, but it is their personality that truly sets the doctor apart. SCP-882 is known for their dry sense of humor, often delivering a good deadpan joke when you least expect it. Even if they are not the center of attention, SCP-882's humor always leaves a lasting impression on their peers. Overall, SCP-882 may be an oddball in terms of appearance, but they have more than earned their place as a valuable member of the Foundation's medical staff.
