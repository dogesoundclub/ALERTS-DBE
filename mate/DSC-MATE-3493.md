ID # : DSC-MATE-3493
Description: DSC 3493 is a human female with orange stripes on her face and her lips painted in red. DSC 3493's head resembles that of a pink rabbit while wearing a red cross earring on her ears. It also wears a choker and often carries a cigarette in its hand. DSC 3493 is capable of producing a range of sounds beyond what a human voice box is capable of. DSC 3493's blue clown eyes possess a memetic effect that causes anyone within a 10-meter radius to act as if they are under the influence of clownish behaviour - this effect ceases as soon as the individual's vision of DSC 3493 is impeded. DSC 3493 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility to a particular, as yet unknown, cause, and will use its abilities to achieve its goals. DSC 3493's personality is extroverted and humorous, often entertaining staff with its dance moves and silly antics.
