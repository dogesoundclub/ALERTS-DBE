SCP-4496, also known as "The Bunny Banker," is a member of the Lagomorpha family, specifically an anthropomorphic rabbit. SCP-4496 presents itself as a distinguished and professional individual, often seen wearing horned rim glasses as it studies extensive financial documents. In addition, SCP-4496 frequently adorns a doge hat paired with a red scarf, adding to its sense of formality.

SCP-4496's analytical and logical nature is quite evident in its chosen profession as a banker. Its calculating tendencies and sharp attention for detail also make it an adept debater, savoring in the opportunity to engage in lively arguments with others. However, despite its fondness for debate, SCP-4496 maintains a light-hearted and charming demeanor that can occasionally border on eccentricity.

SCP-4496 may appear non-threatening, but its cunning and street-smart mindset should not be underestimated. Its keen skills in manipulating finances could aid in its covert ability to launder money for illegal organizations, making it a potential risk to society. As a result, SCP-4496 is to be monitored closely and is only allowed to operate within authorized financial institutions.
