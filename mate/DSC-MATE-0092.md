Item #: 92

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject, identified as a human female real estate agent, is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents. The subject’s day-to-day activities may proceed as normal, however, any unusual behavior or occurrence must be reported immediately to the overseeing researcher. Under no circumstances should the subject be allowed to come into contact with any anomalous properties or artifacts.

Description: The subject, designated as 92, presents an unusual physical appearance for a human. She has distinctive spots across her face, a purple lip, and red clown eyes. Her head appears to be that of a pink rabbit, with green cross earrings adorning her ears. The subject often chooses to wear a choker as an accessory.

92 displays a somewhat erratic and forgetful personality. She has been known to forget important appointments and become easily sidetracked, often leading her to become lost while trying to find her way. Despite her forgetfulness, the subject has been successful as a real estate agent, often selling properties that were previously thought to be unsellable.

Addendum: During routine monitoring of subject 92, it was discovered that she had come across an artifact of interest to the Foundation. It is recommended that the subject be approached for further questioning regarding the artifact’s appearance and location.
