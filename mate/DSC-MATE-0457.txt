Item #: SCP-457

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-457 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with an air-tight seal and fire suppression system. The subject's medical mask is to be replaced regularly to prevent the spread of any potential pathogens. Any attempts to damage or breach the containment chamber are to be met with immediate lethal force.

Description: SCP-457 is a female human identified as a delivery driver. The subject possesses several unique physical characteristics, including spots and a red lip on their face, as well as red clown eyes. SCP-457's head has an unusual appearance, featuring a wing on the side. Their ears are pierced with a jade earring, and they wear a choker as an accessory.

SCP-457 exhibits a strong sense of independence and is often resistant to authority or rules they see as unnecessary. This trait has resulted in rebellious behavior, including taking unauthorized days off or leaving work early without permission.

SCP-457 is a potential fire hazard, as they can spontaneously combust when exposed to open flames, causing severe damage to nearby objects or individuals. As a result, the subject is to be strictly monitored at all times and kept away from combustible materials.

Addendum: SCP-457 has been designated a Euclid-class object due to their unpredictable combustion abilities and rebellious behavior. Additional testing is ongoing to determine the extent and nature of these anomalous traits.
