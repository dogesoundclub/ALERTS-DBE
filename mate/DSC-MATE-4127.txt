Item #: SCP-4127

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4127 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. It is permitted to engage in employment as a fast food worker under the guise of an average human until further notice. SCP-4127 is not to be permitted to leave Site-██ except when escorted by Level 3 personnel for testing purposes. 

Description: SCP-4127 is a male human, standing at 5'9" and weighing approximately 158 lbs. Its face is noticeably spotted, with a frightened mouth, and normal eyesight that requires the use of glasses. SCP-4127 displays a distinct love for adventure and risk-taking behavior, which often lead to humorous anecdotes.

SCP-4127's head hair is parted pink, and its ears bear a jade earring on the right lobe. It also sports a silver chain accessory, and typically carries a candy stick at all times.

SCP-4127's physical abilities appear to be that of a standard average human. However, its love for risks and trying new things is more pronounced than most individuals.

Addendum-1: During a recent routine medical exam, SCP-4127 displayed a higher than average form of adrenaline production, allowing for increased physical performance during moments of heightened adrenaline. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of this ability. 

Addendum-2: SCP-4127's previous employment history included a stint as a bungee-jumping instructor until Foundation intervention. Interviews with former clients have revealed several incidents where SCP-4127 appears to have cheated death, suggesting a possible anomalous ability. 

Further testing of SCP-4127's physical and psychological abilities is ongoing.
