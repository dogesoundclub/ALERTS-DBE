Item #: 547

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-547 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents assigned to the local news station where it works as a news anchor. Access to DSC-MATE-547 is strictly limited to authorized personnel wearing Level 2 clearance or higher.

In case of a breach, DSC-MATE-547 is to be approached with caution by personnel wearing both gas masks and sound-canceling headphones, as it has been known to emit high-pitched frequencies that can cause disorientation and headaches.

Description: DSC-MATE-547 is a humanoid creature with orange stripes on its face and a metal purple head. DSC-MATE-547's forehead features a pair of goggles, and it wears a medical mask over its mouth. Furthermore, DSC-MATE-547 is known to wear a red scarf.

Despite its appearance, DSC-MATE-547 has been classified as a human being. Its abilities, however, suggest otherwise. DSC-MATE-547 possesses an incredible intellect, and it tends to be very analytical and logical. DSC-MATE-547 enjoys debating and arguing with others, which can lead to humorous situations, as it is known to debate trivial and unimportant subjects passionately.

DSC-MATE-547's abilities have also been known to cause physical and mental effects on those around it. As mentioned before, it emits high-pitched frequencies that can cause disorientation and headaches. DSC-MATE-547's arguments can also cause confusion and mental fatigue in those present, leading to a temporary inability to remember or perform simple tasks.

Despite this, DSC-MATE-547 has been valuable in the Foundation's efforts to gather information and stay up to date on current events. Its position as a news anchor has given it access to information that would typically be impossible to obtain for the Foundation. 

Addendum: Interview log with DSC-MATE-547

Dr. ██████: Can you tell us about your abilities?

DSC-MATE-547: My abilities? (laughs) I suppose I can argue just about anything until I'm blue in the face. It's a gift, really.

Dr. ██████: And what about the headaches and disorientation you cause? Can you explain that to us?

DSC-MATE-547: Ah, yes. Well, it seems that my mind, and by extension my vocal cords, give off some sort of high frequency that is not particularly pleasant to humans. It's not something I can control, I'm afraid.

Dr. ██████: I see. And your position as a news anchor, that's been helpful to the Foundation?

DSC-MATE-547: Oh, absolutely. I've got my finger on the pulse of this city. And the best part is, I get to argue with people for a living. It's a win-win, really.
