Item #: DSC-MATE-7557

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7557 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All gifts given to DSC-MATE-7557 must be inspected by Site personnel before being delivered. DSC-MATE-7557 is allowed to work as a mechanic under surveillance at a nearby facility.

Description: DSC-MATE-7557 appears as a male monkey with red clown eyes, a frightened mouth, a purple cap with a headset, and a jade earring. His forehead has a 2-color band marking. Despite his comical appearance, DSC-MATE-7557 has shown intelligence and technical knowledge beyond what is expected of a non-human primate.

DSC-MATE-7557 has a compulsive need to give gifts to those around him. He is highly observant and attentive to details, making him an expert gift-giver. However, DSC-MATE-7557 can become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and will spend an excessive amount of time trying to find the ideal present. This trait has caused DSC-MATE-7557 to become emotionally distressed whenever he is unable to give gifts to those around him.

DSC-MATE-7557 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become hostile if they try to prevent him from giving gifts. DSC-MATE-7557 possesses moderate strength and dexterity, making him skilled in repairing machinery. However, DSC-MATE-7557 has a history of sabotaging machinery if he perceives that the owner of the object is unappreciative towards his gifts.

Addendum: Incident 7557-A
On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-7557 was caught attempting to give a live grenade as a gift to a technician at his workplace. Upon questioning, DSC-MATE-7557 explained that he had overheard the technician mention a love for explosives and believed this would be the perfect gift. Foundation personnel quickly retrieved the grenade and subdued DSC-MATE-7557 without incident. DSC-MATE-7557 has been placed under even closer observation, and all future gifts will be inspected before delivery.
