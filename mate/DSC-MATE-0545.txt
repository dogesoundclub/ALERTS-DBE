Item #: SCP-545

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-545 is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit, furnished with a variety of chew toys, food and water dispensers, and a suitable habitat. All personnel are to be trained in handling rabbits and are required to wear gloves when entering the containment area.

SCP-545 is not to be exposed to any foreign agents or chemicals that may have a deleterious effect on their physiology, as SCP-545's well-being is essential to their continued cooperation with Foundation personnel.

SCP-545 is to receive weekly visits from a licensed veterinarian, who will administer any necessary medical treatment and ensure SCP-545 remains in optimal health.

Description: SCP-545 is a male rabbit, standing at 15 centimeters in height and weighing approximately 500 grams. The rabbit's most notable feature is its red clown eyes, which emit an eerie glow in low light conditions. SCP-545's fur is primarily white, with a green tuft of hair protruding from the rabbit's purple cap, complemented by jade earring.

SCP-545 appears to possess some degree of sapience, as it recognizes and responds to human speech with a variety of vocalizations and gestures, such as a frightened mouth expression when it feels threatened, and bantering playfully with others.

SCP-545's goofy behavior may at times jeopardize its own safety and that of others, thus caution must be taken when interacting with it.

Addendum 545-a: SCP-545 has been observed to have a calming effect on other animals that are agitated or in distress, indicating SCP-545 may possess a psychic ability to soothe and comfort other creatures. Researchers have attempted to study this ability further, but so far, no verifiable results have been attained.
