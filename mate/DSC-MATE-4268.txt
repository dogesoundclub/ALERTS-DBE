Any physical interaction with SCP-4268 should be conducted under careful observation to prevent triggering anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-4268 is a male human identified as a firefighter by profession. SCP-4268's physical features include spots on the face, forehead with a two-color band, parted pink hair, and green cross earrings. SCP-4268 wears nerdy glasses and a gold chain as accessories.

SCP-4268's anomalous effects manifest as the ability to feel and understand the emotions of those around him at an exceptionally high level. The subject displays an emotional connection to suffering and pain, often resulting in tearful or emotional outbursts. SCP-4268 also possesses an affinity towards animals and nature.

Addendum 4268-01: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-4268 was involved in an operation to subdue a fire outbreak in a residential building. During the operation, SCP-4268 noticed the presence of a tabby cat in the vicinity, which seemed distressed by the situation.

SCP-4268 proceeded to divert from the firefighting operation to attend to the cat with the aim of rescuing it. Despite the urgency of the situation, SCP-4268 remained focused on the cat's well-being until it was safe, leading to perplexed behaviour from SCP-4268's team members.

Following the incident, SCP-4268's consciousness was assessed, and its emotional connection to the rescued cat appeared to exceed typical human bondage. The event prompted further containment measures to prevent SCP-4268 from endangering itself or others through empathic distractions.

Addendum 4268-02: Interview Log

Interviewer: Dr. █████

<Begin Log>

Dr. █████: SCP-4268, please describe how you perceive emotions.

SCP-4268: Umm, it's not exactly easy to explain, but it's like feeling a piano playing a symphony in your head. Each note represents a different feeling, and it's like they're all playing at once, but I can distinguish them individually, you know?

Dr. █████: Do you feel in control of the emotions you experience?

SCP-4268: No, it's not something I can control. It's like I'm wearing emotions as an extra layer, and I can't just take them off when I want to. They come when they come, and they go when they go.

Dr. █████: Do you think your anomalous effects have any limitations or weaknesses?

SCP-4268: I'm not sure, but I know that if I'm not careful, my emotions can become too hard to handle. It's like an intense surge of energy, and it can get overwhelming.

Closing Statement: SCP-4268's emotional awareness and subsequent display of sentimentality warrant further study. As a firefighter, SCP-4268's potential for distraction and disasters need to be monitored and kept under control.
