SCP Foundation Containment Report #3463

Subject #3463, also known as "The Programmer," is a male human with distinct features that make him easily identifiable. He is often seen wearing nerd glasses, a green cross earring, a gold chain, and carrying a candy stick. His face is marked with noticeable spots and a friendly smile.

Despite his seemingly harmless appearance, #3463 has exhibited qualities that make him a potential threat. He is remarkably organized, meticulously planning out every detail of his life in advance. However, this organizational trait is coupled with unrestrained spontaneity, leading to unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior.

His spontaneous side has resulted in unexpected situations that have caused significant concern. #3463 has been known to surprise his acquaintances with impromptu adventures, leading them into potentially hazardous situations. Furthermore, he has been known to suddenly plan and execute last-minute parties, with unexpected results.

As such, #3463 is to be monitored closely and all of his actions must be carefully documented for future reference. Any parties he attempts to plan or adventures he proposes must be pre-approved and accompanied by Foundation personnel to ensure public safety.

In the event that #3463 exhibits further unpredictable behavior or becomes a danger to himself or others, Foundation protocol dictates that he be contained in a secure facility for further examination and study.
