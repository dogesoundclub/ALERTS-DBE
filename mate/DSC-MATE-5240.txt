Item #: SCP-5240

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5240 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to its tendency towards reckless behavior, all interactions with SCP-5240 must be supervised by at least two security personnel. Any attempts by SCP-5240 to leave its designated area must be met with immediate intervention.

Description: SCP-5240 is a human female identified as a car salesman. Its appearance is notable for its red clown eyes and red lipstick, along with a two-color band on its forehead and a pair of goggles atop its head. SCP-5240 also wears a green cross earring, a choker, and is often seen with a cigarette.

SCP-5240 is prone to impulsive behavior, often acting on its emotions rather than rational thought. This has led to several humorous situations, although the potential danger of its unpredictable actions cannot be ignored. SCP-5240 has shown no signs of heightened physical or cognitive abilities beyond what would be expected of a normal human.

Interview Log 5240-A:

Dr. █████: Can you tell us about your job as a car salesman?

SCP-5240: Well, it's all about the art of persuasion. You know, getting people to see things your way. And if that means taking a risk or two, then so be it.

Dr. █████: Risk-taking doesn't always lead to positive outcomes.

SCP-5240: Oh, I know that. But sometimes you gotta take chances in life, you know? Makes things more interesting.

Dr. █████: Interesting, perhaps. But also potentially dangerous.

SCP-5240: Yeah, I guess. But that's the fun of it all. Who wants to live a boring life?

Note: SCP-5240's nonchalant attitude towards danger is concerning. Further study is necessary to determine the extent of its impulsive tendencies.
