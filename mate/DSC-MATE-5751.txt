Description:
SCP-5751 is a male Tiger with blue clown eyes, wearing a purple cap with a headset and a red scarf, and a medical mask. SCP-5751 is identified as a Mechanic with a strong aptitude for repairing and maintaining mechanical devices, including anomalous technology.

SCP-5751 exhibits an idealistic personality and a strong desire to make the world a better place. SCP-5751 often protests or boycotts companies or causes they feel go against their values, which can lead to humorous situations. SCP-5751 also shows a high level of empathy towards other creatures and motor vehicles in need of repair, becoming distressed if unable to perform maintenance and repairs.

SCP-5751 possesses anomalous abilities, which are triggered by the restoration of outdated mechanical systems. SCP-5751 can transfer life energy into the repaired device, which then exhibits anomalous properties. The extent of these properties is dependent on the size and complexity of the system.

SCP-5751 is generally cooperative but has shown aggressive behavior when attempts are made to interfere with its attempts to repair and maintain mechanical devices.

Addendum:
SCP-5751 gained attention from the Foundation after gaining notoriety for protesting a large corporation. During the protest, SCP-5751 repaired the company’s outdated equipment, causing it to become anomalous and attract the Foundation’s attention. SCP-5751 was subsequently contained and labeled an SCP.
