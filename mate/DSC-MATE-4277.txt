SCP-4277 is a rather unusual subject, even by our standards. Identified as an electrician, this male Rabbit is a true oddity in both appearance and demeanor. His most notable feature is undoubtedly the Ski Goggle Eyes. Whether due to an abnormal mutation or deliberate tampering, the subject's eyes now consist of a transparent outer layer surrounding two spherical lenses. Despite this unique characteristic, the subject appears perfectly capable of navigating his way around the world. 

SCP-4277's Accessories, a red scarf and candy stick, have been found to be present at all times, but their significance is unknown. The scarf appears to be a personal preference of the subject, while the candy stick does not seem to serve any practical purpose. Both items are currently being analyzed for any anomalous properties.

The subject's Personality is equally odd, possessing a dry sense of humor that catches people off guard. Despite not being the life of the party, SCP-4277 is known for delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly hilarious, leaving those who know him in a state of bewilderment. Though he presents himself as light-hearted, it's unsure if this attitude is a facade, or if it's a genuine personality trait.

Due to his specific abilities and unusual characteristics, SCP-4277 will continue to be monitored and studied thoroughly. Any attempts at interaction with the subject must be conducted with caution, as it's currently unknown what his limits may be.
