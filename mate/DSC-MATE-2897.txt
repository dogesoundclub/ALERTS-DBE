Item #: SCP-2897

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2897 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Communication with SCP-2897 is only to be conducted by trained personnel equipped with psychic shielding. SCP-2897 is permitted to have limited personal effects including gold earrings, gold chain, and cigarettes under direct supervision. SCP-2897 is considered to be a high-value target for retrieval in the event of containment breach.

Description: SCP-2897 appears to be a human female in their mid-30s. Notable features include red clown eyes and a constant smile. SCP-2897 is often seen wearing a pair of goggles on their forehead. Their attire tends to be casual, often consisting of a leather jacket and jeans. They are known to carry a gold chain and a cigarette.

SCP-2897 possesses an unquantifiable level of intuition and clairvoyance. Although they do not possess the physical or paranormal means by which to obtain this knowledge, they possess the ability to predict future events and sense emotions. This trait can be both impressive and unsettling to those who interact with SCP-2897.

Due to the nature of SCP-2897's abilities, they are considered a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, their tendency to use their abilities for their personal gain and penchant for villainous behavior generates a significant risk. As such, they should be approached with caution.

Addendum: While SCP-2897's abilities are not fully understood, its possible that they may have come into contact with anomalous entities prior to capture. Further investigation is needed to determine if SCP-2897 has any connections to known paranormal groups.
