SCP Foundation Classification: SCP-4808

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4808 is to be placed on a restricted schedule and work exclusively as a Traffic Officer. All access to firearms is prohibited due to SCP-4808's impulsive behavior. They must wear their required uniform and accessories at all times.

Description: SCP-4808 is a human male of average height and weight. Their most distinctive feature is the irregular spots on their face. SCP-4808's eyes display red coloration similar to that of a clown, and they wear a jade earring in their left ear. They also wear a red scarf and a standard gas mask during their shifts. SCP-4808's personality is impulsive and often irrational, leading to unforeseen consequences.

SCP-4808's abilities seem to manifest during traffic operations. They have the ability to manipulate traffic lights and redirect traffic in a matter of seconds. It appears that SCP-4808's actions during these situations do not adhere to standard protocol and may cause confusion and chaos. Additionally, SCP-4808's impulsive behavior has resulted in a number of curious and unpredictable outcomes.

Despite its anomalous properties, SCP-4808 is cooperative and is able to communicate with Foundation personnel. However, SCP-4808's impulsiveness has led to incidents of Foundation staff being caught off guard. Therefore, interaction with SCP-4808 requires caution and careful consideration.

Overall, it is recommended that SCP-4808 remain contained and under constant observation. Research into the extent of SCP-4808's control over traffic and whether there are other anomalous abilities has been deemed a high priority.
