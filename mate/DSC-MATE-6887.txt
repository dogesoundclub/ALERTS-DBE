Description: SCP-6887, also known as "The News Anchor", is a male monkey that has an appearance similar to that of a Capuchin monkey. SCP-6887 wears normal glasses and a red beanie on its head.

SCP-6887 is a highly intelligent monkey, able to understand human speech and communicate through sign language. SCP-6887's primary job is as a news anchor for a local news channel, where it has gained popularity due to its charisma and humorous personality. SCP-6887 has a tendency to act on its emotions rather than thinking things through, leading to some humorous situations that others may find amusing or surprising. SCP-6887 can often be found making impulsive decisions, causing problems for itself and others.

SCP-6887's abilities have been studied extensively by the Foundation, and it has been determined that it possesses no anomalous properties other than its high intelligence and language capabilities. SCP-6887 has also displayed an above-average level of physical agility and strength.

Addendum: Due to SCP-6887's popularity on the news channel, it has become a local celebrity, resulting in an increase in public interest in the Foundation. Foundation personnel are advised to monitor any potential security breaches that may result from SCP-6887's public exposure.
