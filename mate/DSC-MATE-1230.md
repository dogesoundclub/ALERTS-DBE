DSC-MATE-1230: The Monkey Real Estate Agent

Classification: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1230 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be furnished with appropriate items and vegetation to simulate a monkey's natural habitat. A security camera must be installed in the containment chamber to monitor the subject's behavior at all times.

DSC-MATE-1230 is allowed to keep its silver chain and candy stick as personal effects, but all other possessions are to be confiscated and cataloged. Any requests for additional items or personal effects must be approved by a Level 3 or higher personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-1230 is a male monkey with ski goggle eyes. The species of the monkey is unknown, but it exhibits humanoid characteristics such as the ability to speak English and use human tools. DSC-MATE-1230 is a real estate agent by trade and operates as such in the outside world.

DSC-MATE-1230 has a caring and nurturing personality, often treating friends and family members as if they were its own children. This trait has led to several humorous situations where DSC-MATE-1230 has attempted to care for its fellow DSCs or even staff members.

DSC-MATE-1230's silver chain appears to be of sentimental value to the subject, and it often wears it around its neck. The candy stick is occasionally used as a reward for good behavior or as a stress-relieving measure.

DSC-MATE-1230 was recovered by Foundation agents after it was discovered operating a real estate agency in ████████, █████████. The monkey's ability to accurately appraise property values and negotiate contracts was deemed anomalous and warranted further investigation.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1230 has expressed a desire to be reunited with its "family", which it claims live in ██████████, ██. This request is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
