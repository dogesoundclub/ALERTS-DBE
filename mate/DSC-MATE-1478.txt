Subject 1478, codenamed "The Tiger" is a male of the feline species, whose appearance is both fierce and intimidating. He sports a blue bandana on his head and dons a pair of nerd glasses over his intense eyes, giving him an intellectual appearance. Adding to his punk-rock look is a gold earring dangling from one ear and a silver chain that drapes across his broad chest. He's often seen with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, a constant reminder of his bad-boy image. 

However, don't let his wild exterior fool you - this villain has a love for adventure and taking risks. His thrill-seeking behavior has led to some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. Subject 1478 is not one to shy away from new challenges and is always eager to try new things.

Approach with caution, as The Tiger's playful and carefree nature can sometimes lead to careless decisions, putting himself and those around him in danger.
