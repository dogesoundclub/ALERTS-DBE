Item #: 1503

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1503 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19. The cell must be furnished with suitable amenities for a primate, and a supply of bananas should be regularly provided for 1503's consumption. Two armed guards, equipped with tranquilizers, must be stationed outside the cell at all times.

SCP-1503 is permitted to work as the manager of the █████ Theater in the town of ████████ under Foundation guise. Security cameras and microphones have been installed at the theater to monitor 1503's activities, and no members of the audience may directly interact with SCP-1503.

SCP-1503's wardrobe and accessories have been removed and must remain in Foundation custody. Foundation personnel are authorized to utilize these items as a lure or enticement should it become necessary to bait 1503 with a reward.

Description: SCP-1503 is a capuchin monkey with black hair, noticeable horned rim glasses, and a gold earring in one ear. 1503 always wears a red scarf regardless of the temperature or climate.

SCP-1503 has demonstrated a high intelligence level, displaying the ability to understand and speak in a gibberish-like language of its own creation. SCP-1503 is also known to convey its thoughts to others through a series of gestures and movements.

SCP-1503 displays a spontaneous and impulsive personality that can lead to unpredictable behavior. This may include taking risks, which can result in significant harm to both SCP-1503 and those around it. SCP-1503 must be monitored at all times to prevent any incidents of this nature.

SCP-1503 has been observed to display an affinity for the performing arts, particularly theater. SCP-1503 is the current manager of the █████ Theater and has been known to perform on stage during rehearsals, often without permission.

Addendum: SCP-1503's antics during rehearsals may have drawn unwanted attention from members of the audience. Recent changes to the theater seating arrangement have been enacted to prevent SCP-1503 from interacting with the audience directly. It is recommended to continue monitoring SCP-1503 for any further abnormal behavior.
