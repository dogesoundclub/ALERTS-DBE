It is unknown if these incidents are caused by an anomalous effect or simply a personality quirk.

DSC-MATE-8258 has no known connections to occult or magical phenomena, and does not display any notable abilities or powers. However, due to her somewhat unusual appearance and mannerisms, it is recommended that caution be taken when interacting with DSC-MATE-8258.
