Item #: 3673

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3673 is to be housed in standard humanoid containment, and must be provided with regular communication and personal belongings. They require special permission to keep items, such as mechanical tools or household appliances, with which they have developed a strong emotional attachment. Any anomalous properties or behavior displayed by 3673 must be reported to the Foundation immediately.

Description: Subject 3673 is a human female, approximately 35 years of age, with distinctive spot markings on their face. They possess an unusual purple lip, and typically wear normal glasses and a red cross earring. Their background is unknown, though they have demonstrated above-average mechanical skills.

Personality wise, they display a strong affinity for caregiving, and are known to extend this disposition to inanimate objects. 3673 is known to bestow names upon their household appliances, as well as hold conversations with their plants. This attachment is consistent but does not result in any notable discomfort or distress from 3673.

Addendum: It has come to the Foundation's attention that 3673 possesses additional anomalous properties. Research is ongoing, and further updates will be provided as necessary.
