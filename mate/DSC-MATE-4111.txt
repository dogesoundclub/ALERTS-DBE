SCP-4111's mouth has a perpetually frightened expression and their ears are pierced with a jade earring. The subject is frequently seen wearing a vibrant red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-4111 has been noted to have an outgoing and social personality, often seeking the center of attention. When regaling stories or cracking jokes, the subject has been known to captivate their audience to the point of raucous laughter. These social tendencies may serve as a coping mechanism or a personality trait, but the potential effects of SCP-4111's anomalous properties must be closely monitored.
