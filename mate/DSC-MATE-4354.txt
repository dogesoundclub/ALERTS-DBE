Item #: SCP-4354

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4354 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not working as the theater manager. Access to SCP-4354's chamber is only allowed with Level 2 clearance or higher. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear ear protection due to SCP-4354's tendency to make loud, piercing noises.

SCP-4354's job as theater manager is to be closely monitored, and any unusual behavior is to be reported immediately to Site Director ████. It is recommended that SCP-4354's responsibilities be limited to administrative duties and not include any production decisions.

Description: SCP-4354 is a male monkey with red clown eyes and a hoodie on its head, with a two-color band on its forehead. SCP-4354's most notable feature is its whistle accessory, which it uses frequently to communicate or signal for attention.

SCP-4354's personality is characterized by impulsiveness and a love for risk-taking. It is known to engage in spontaneous activities, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-4354's behavior can be unpredictable and may pose a danger to itself or others.

SCP-4354 has exhibited no unusual physical abilities or anomalous traits, aside from its vocal range and piercing whistle. It is unclear how SCP-4354 acquired its humanoid intelligence and ability to speak.

Addendum: Incident 4354-1

On ██/██/████, SCP-4354 impulsively decided to perform a "stunt" during a theater production, resulting in several injuries to both cast members and audience members. SCP-4354 was immediately restrained and brought back to its containment chamber. The incident led to a review of SCP-4354's job duties, resulting in a ban on any involvement in production decisions. Further investigation into SCP-4354's behavior and origin is ongoing.
