Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8361 is to be contained in a secure office at all times when not on air. Any persons attempting to make contact with SCP-8361 outside of authorized interviews or appearances must be removed immediately. SCP-8361 is allowed access to news-related materials, but all other forms of media are prohibited. All colleagues and employees of SCP-8361's news station are to be monitored for any signs of a developing cognitohazard. 

Description: SCP-8361 is a human female in their early thirties. They are a news anchor for a local news station and maintain a prominent position within the community. SCP-8361 is easily identifiable by their unique facial features, including purple lips, normal glasses, and a purple cap with a headset. SCP-8361 also wears a green cross earring and a choker. They are often found smoking a cigarette during their off-air time. 

SCP-8361 is highly empathetic and compassionate, often taking on the problems of others as their own. This trait can be both admirable and detrimental to SCP-8361's mental well-being. SCP-8361 feels a deep responsibility to fix everything and everyone around them, which can lead to personal burnout and stress. 

SCP-8361 has demonstrated a unique ability to influence others through their reporting. Their news stories have been known to affect the emotions and behaviors of viewers, leading to concerns about potential cognitive hazards. SCP-8361 has been observed actively trying to suppress this ability, citing concerns about the potential effects on their viewers. 

Further observation and research are required to fully understand SCP-8361's cognitive abilities and their potential risks to society. 

Addendum: Following the discovery of SCP-8361, Foundation agents have increased their monitoring of all news stations and media outlets. Any instances of potentially cognitohazardous reports are to be reported to Foundation officials immediately.
