Item #: SCP-5045

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5045 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. SCP-5045's cell is to be furnished with standard accommodations for a human occupant. Under no circumstances are personnel to remove SCP-5045's mask without approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. 

Description: SCP-5045 is a female human of indeterminate age, standing approximately 1.68 meters tall and weighing approximately 62 kilograms. SCP-5045 is a skilled electrician and is capable of repairing and maintaining complex electrical systems. SCP-5045's most striking facial feature is a set of spots which cover the entirety of her face. SCP-5045's eyes are a bright blue and resemble circus clown eyes. SCP-5045 constantly wears a medical mask over her mouth and nose, which obscures her facial expressions and hinders audible communication. SCP-5045 also wears a choker, which appears to be purely decorative.

SCP-5045 possesses a natural charm and charisma, which can make her the life of the party or disarm potential foes. SCP-5045 frequently engages in humorous situations, such as telling jokes or performing silly dances to entertain others. SCP-5045 has been known to use her charm to gain access to restricted areas or to convince individuals to provide her with sensitive information.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-5045 was brought to Foundation attention when she was accidentally exposed to an anomalous electrical conductor. SCP-5045 demonstrated an ability to control and manipulate electricity beyond that of a normal human. SCP-5045's electrical manipulation abilities were deemed too uncontrollable to be a reliable asset and she was contained until further notice.
