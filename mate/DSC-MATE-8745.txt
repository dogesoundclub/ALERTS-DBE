Item #: SCP-8745

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8745 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a private workplace equipped with tools and materials for mechanical repairs. Communication devices such as phones and computers are not allowed in his possession. Only Level 2 personnel or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-8745.

Description: SCP-8745 is a human male standing at 1.85 meters in height and weighing 84 kilograms. His eyes are replaced with ski goggles and he wears a short peak cap and jade earrings. SCP-8745 is observed to wear a medical mask to conceal an unknown facial condition. He is often seen wearing a red scarf.

SCP-8745 is a mechanic by profession, and appears to be well-versed in the repair and modification of machinery and vehicles. SCP-8745 demonstrates a natural talent for leadership, often taking charge of situations and commanding respect from his colleagues and subordinates. However, this personality trait does not appear to be anomalous in nature.

Any attempts to communicate or interact with SCP-8745 in a confrontational or disrespectful manner have resulted in hostility and aggression from SCP-8745. This includes probing questions about his facial condition, which SCP-8745 refuses to disclose.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8745's exceptional mechanical skills and leadership qualities, he has been approved for use in Mobile Task Force Omega-5 ("Blacksmiths") for the purposes of equipment repair and maintenance. SCP-8745 is to be accompanied by at least two armed Foundation personnel at all times during field missions.
