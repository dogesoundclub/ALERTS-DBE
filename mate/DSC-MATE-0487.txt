Item #: 487

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 487, known publicly as Car Salesman, is to be monitored at all times by undercover agents in order to prevent unnecessary attention towards its anomalous features. Agent 487 must not engage Subject 487 in any conversation that could lead to the exposure of its abilities. In the event of exposure, amnestics must be administered to those involved.

Description: Subject 487 appears to be a female human of average height and weight, with no outwardly abnormal features. However, closer inspection shows that its face is adorned with orange stripes and its eyes glow with a rainbow of LED lights that resemble a virtual reality headset. Its head appears to be that of a pink rabbit, complete with floppy ears that bear a red cross earring. Most strikingly, Subject 487 consistently wears a choker with an unknown symbol etched into it.

Personality: Subject 487 exhibits a natural talent for leadership and often finds itself taking charge of situations, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in its personal life. Its persuasive skills are unparalleled and it is known to be able to talk anyone into anything it desires, leading to suspicions that its abilities may extend beyond just human charisma. Subjects who interact with it often report feeling a strange, almost hypnotic draw towards it, leaving them willing to carry out its every whim, no matter how outlandish.

Notes: It is currently unclear the extent of Subject 487's abilities and the purpose behind its strange appearance. Further study is required in order to understand the full extent of its anomalous properties.
