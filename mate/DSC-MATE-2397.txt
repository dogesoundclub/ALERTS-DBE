Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2397 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to blankets and pillows has been granted to SCP-2397.

Description: SCP-2397 is a rabbit-like humanoid with an average height of 1.5 meters. It possesses red clown-like eyes and a constantly frightened mouth. SCP-2397 is often seen wearing a hoodie with a two-color band on its forehead. It also wears a silver chain around its neck and carries a whistle resembling that of a football referee. SCP-2397 is male and exhibits a curious and inquisitive personality.

SCP-2397's primary function is that of a delivery driver. Its deliveries are often of a sensitive nature and require a high degree of discretion. The methodology by which SCP-2397 performs its task is still unknown. It is capable of appearing and disappearing without a trace, and has been known to somehow circumvent standard security systems. The Foundation is currently investigating SCP-2397's potential abilities and threats.

SCP-2397 has a thirst for knowledge and is known to spend long stretches of time reading and researching obscure topics. It has shown a fascination with collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials. SCP-2397 will often passionately share its newfound knowledge with anyone who will listen. However, its knowledge often comes at a price, as SCP-2397 has been known to manipulate individuals into providing it with knowledge or intelligence in exchange for its services.

SCP-2397 is in possession of its own mind and will act according to its self-interest. As such, it should not be designated as friendly or hostile without proper precautions. Any interactions with SCP-2397 should be treated with caution and monitored at all times.
