Item #: 1156

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: As of [REDACTED], SCP-1156 has been deceased and no longer requires containment or monitoring.

Description: SCP-1156 was a male human politician with distinct facial features. He was noted to have orange stripes on his face and a constant smile, which were both prominent features that seemed to be natural. His eyes were reported to have had blue clown-like irises, which was unsettling to some people who interacted with him. SCP-1156 had a peculiar attachment to his hoodie, which he constantly wore regardless of any weather. A 2 color band on his forehead was a visible marker on his features.

SCP-1156 was observed to carry a gas mask frequently. It is unclear as to why he felt the need to wear it as his medical history did not reveal any significant health condition that required him to use a gas mask.

Personality-wise, SCP-1156 was known to value traditions that were passed down to him or his family or community. This value, coupled with a no-nonsense attitude, often leaded him to be perceived as a stern person. However, SCP-1156 was also known to have a playful side and derived pleasure from sharing jokes and stories with those who interacted with him. Overall, SCP-1156 was regarded as an enigmatic individual, but he was mostly harmless. 

Note: After SCP-1156's passing, it was revealed that he was a key player in a complex network of entities involved in [REDACTED]. The Foundation's investigation into his past has been closed, and all related information has been redacted or destroyed.
