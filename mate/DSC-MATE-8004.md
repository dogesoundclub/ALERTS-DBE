Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8004 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a bed, desk, and clothing storage. The room must be kept free of any and all technology, as DSC-MATE-8004 has a tendency to manipulate electronic devices to their own whims. Any personnel entering DSC-MATE-8004's containment chamber are to be accompanied by two armed guards at all times.
