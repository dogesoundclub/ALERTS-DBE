Item #: SCP-3054

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3054 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-3054 is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-3054 is allowed limited contact with outside personnel for the purposes of covert monitoring and data collection.

Description: SCP-3054 is a humanoid of the male gender, approximately 32 years of age at the time of initial containment. SCP-3054 presents with an unusual head, which has a metallic purple color and is adorned with a pair of goggles on the forehead. The face features of SCP-3054 are characterized by orange stripes, a smile, and ordinary glasses.

SCP-3054 is a car salesman by trade and frequently displays a charismatic and positive demeanor while performing his duties. However, SCP-3054 has displayed a pattern of strongly idealistic tendencies that influence his opinions on various matters. SCP-3054 has a tendency to engage in protests or boycott activities when he feels his values have been compromised or violated.

Accessories worn by SCP-3054 include a cigarette, which he often smokes while communicating with others. SCP-3054's behavior and mannerisms suggest that he is fully aware of his anomalous abilities, but willingly keeps them in check to avoid drawing attention to his unusual features.

Addendum: SCP-3054's activities were initially brought to the Foundation's attention following an incident in which he led a large protest against a prominent car manufacturer, claiming they used unethical means to produce their vehicles. This sparked an investigation, which resulted in SCP-3054's containment. Further research is ongoing to determine the full extent of SCP-3054's abilities and any potential threats to public safety that may arise as a result.
