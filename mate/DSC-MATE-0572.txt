Item #: SCP-572

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-572 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-572 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. Any visitors to SCP-572 must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation beforehand to ensure they are not susceptible to its anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-572 appears to be a male humanoid measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighing 75 kilograms. The subject has an appearance characterized by spots on its face and a ski goggle-like pair of eyes. SCP-572 is often seen wearing a short peak cap, a medical mask covering its mouth, a goggle on its forehead, and a green cross earring on its left ear. It is also frequently seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-572 displays a unique personality, which makes it challenging to predict its actions. The subject has a tendency to be very organized and well-planned, but they can also be spontaneous and spur-of-the-moment. This duality sometimes results in unexpected behavior, including impromptu planning of adventures or last-minute parties, which often end up being successful.

SCP-572 is a lawyer, and his profession has served as an excellent cover-up for its anomalous abilities. SCP-572 possesses the ability to manipulate the emotions and thoughts of those around him, making them susceptible to suggestions and orders. This ability extends to all those within its vicinity, even those who are not aware of his presence.

Addendum 572-1: SCP-572 was first discovered in the midst of a criminal trial, during which he was able to manipulate the minds of the judge, jury, and witnesses in order to sway the verdict in his client's favor. The Foundation intervened and apprehended SCP-572, who demonstrated hostility toward the agents, requiring the use of sedatives to transport him safely to Site-██. Since then, the subject has been contained successfully and its abilities have been thoroughly researched.

Addendum 572-2: SCP-572 has become increasingly cooperative, and it appears to recognize the gravity of its condition. Standard interviews and tests have been put in place to monitor its mental state and prevent potential containment breaches. Collaborative research with SCP-572 is ongoing.
