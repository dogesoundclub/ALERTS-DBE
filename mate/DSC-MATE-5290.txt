Item #: SCP-5290

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5290 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-5290's containment chamber is limited to Level 2 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-5290 must be conducted through a protective barrier, and all conversations must be recorded for analysis.

SCP-5290 is to be provided with appropriate hygiene products, as well as a selection of clothing to be rotated on a weekly basis. SCP-5290 is not permitted to leave its containment chamber without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-5290 is a male human identified as a real estate agent named ████████████████, born on ██/██/19██. SCP-5290 has a distinct appearance due to multiple spots on its face, which it often highlights with a wide smile. Its eyes are covered by ski goggles, and it has a not arranged green head. SCP-5290 typically wears a medical mask over its mouth and gold earrings in its ears. It is also frequently seen wearing a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-5290 is known for its dry sense of humor, which can catch those around it off guard. It has a talent for deadpan delivery, making jokes that often surprise those who know it. SCP-5290 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but has displayed a tendency to become agitated when its containment is threatened.

Addendum: SCP-5290 was recovered by the Foundation after a series of reports of strange occurrences at multiple real estate locations linked to SCP-5290. Further investigation revealed that SCP-5290 had been using its abilities to manipulate the thoughts and actions of its clients to ensure a successful sale. SCP-5290 was apprehended and its abilities neutralized through amnestic treatment. It has since been contained at Site-██ without incident.
