Item #: SCP-3429

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3429 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with a gas mask to filter out any potential contagions that SCP-3429 may emit. The chamber must also have soundproof walls due to SCP-3429's overly excitable personality.

SCP-3429's Beautician job will be the cover for its containment. It is not to be allowed into public spaces without supervision, due to the possibility of its species and peculiar features causing panic among the public.

Description: SCP-3429 is a male Tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall when on its hind legs. It has green hair in a purple cap, with a red victory band on its forehead, red cross earring on each ear, and horned rim glasses over its eyes. It also wears an LED gas mask at all times.

SCP-3429 is introspective and spends most of its time contemplating ideas or daydreaming. Its personality can make it absent-minded at times, leading to humorous situations where it may accidentally bump into people, trip over objects, or even walk into walls due to its lack of attention to its immediate surroundings.

SCP-3429 has been known to emit volatile pheromones unconsciously, which can affect individuals causing a range of emotional reactions, including fear or uncontrollable rage. The LED gas mask worn by SCP-3429 is to prevent exposure to these pheromones.

Due to SCP-3429's unique appearance and personality, it is to be monitored continuously by Foundation personnel to prevent it from interacting with the outside world beyond its containment chamber.
