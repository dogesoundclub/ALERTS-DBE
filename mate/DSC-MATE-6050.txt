Item #: SCP-6050

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6050 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. As SCP-6050 has displayed no anomalous abilities besides their appearance, they are allowed socialization periods with other humanoid SCPs. SCP-6050 may not be allowed access to any adventuring equipment, including but not limited to bungee cords, climbing gear, or transportation vehicles. Any attempt by SCP-6050 to acquire these items must be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-6050 is a humanoid female of average height and weight. SCP-6050's face features vibrant orange stripes that run from the bottom of their cheekbones to the corners of their mouth. Their head is adorned with a pair of feathered wings. Despite SCP-6050's vivid appearance, no genetic anomalies have been found.

SCP-6050 displays an intense love for adventure and risk-taking. This personality trait has led to several incidents involving SCP-6050 attempting to obtain adventuring equipment or materials. Despite having no record of prior experience or training, SCP-6050 has attempted to engage in activities such as bungee jumping and mountaineering. These incidents have led to SCP-6050 repeatedly putting themselves in dangerous situations, resulting in multiple near-death experiences. SCP-6050's adventures have also resulted in humorous stories, such as getting lost in the wilderness or accidentally setting fire to a campsite.

As of now, SCP-6050 has not displayed any anomalous abilities besides their appearance and human-like behavior. However, due to their tendency towards risky behavior, they pose a potential threat to themselves and others. Any attempts by SCP-6050 to engage in adventuring activities must be met with immediate intervention.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-6050 was found attempting to construct a makeshift hot air balloon from materials found within their containment cell. The attempt was unsuccessful and SCP-6050 was reprimanded for the infraction. Investigation into how SCP-6050 acquired the materials for the craft is ongoing.
