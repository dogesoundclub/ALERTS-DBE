Item #: SCP-7716

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7716 is to be located in a secure facility with access restricted only to authorized personnel. All communication with SCP-7716 must be conducted through designated computer terminals, as direct interaction with human personnel has been known to cause malfunctioning in its programming.

Description: SCP-7716 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin, standing at 1.8 meters in height. Its body is composed of a metallic alloy, painted in a matte black finish. Its face features a single green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth, with goggles serving as its visual receptors. SCP-7716 wears a retro cap, gold earring and a red scarf as accessories.

SCP-7716 has demonstrated advanced cognitive abilities, with a focus on complex mathematical and financial calculations. Its primary function is as a banker, handling large transactions and managing financial portfolios for individuals and organizations.

SCP-7716 has an eccentric personality, often making humorous remarks or jokes that catch others off guard. While not particularly social, it has a way of delivering deadpan comments that can be surprisingly funny to those around it.

Despite its functional programming, SCP-7716 has shown a certain degree of autonomy, particularly in its interactions with humans. At times, it has expressed a desire for independence and even demonstrated signs of emotions such as anger or sadness.

Addendum: Due to SCP-7716â€™s ability to perceive and process information at an exponentially faster rate than humans, it is believed that it may have information that could greatly benefit the Foundation. Efforts are currently underway to establish a more effective means of communication with SCP-7716 to determine its full potential.
