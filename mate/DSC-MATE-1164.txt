Item #: SCP-1164

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1164 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Due to his status as a mafia boss, security measures are to be heightened during transportation and any interaction with outside personnel. SCP-1164 is allowed one hour of artistic expression per day in a secure art studio, monitored by security personnel at all times. Any attempts by SCP-1164 to communicate with outside individuals must be intercepted and reviewed by Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1164 is a male, human individual with distinctive orange stripes on his face. Most notable among his physical features are his blue clown eyes and frightened mouth. SCP-1164 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a goggle on his forehead, a jade earring, and a gold chain around his neck. SCP-1164 is also frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

Beyond his unique physical characteristics, SCP-1164 is known for his criminal ties as the leader of a mafia syndicate. He is highly intelligent, manipulative, and has displayed an aptitude for violence. Despite this, SCP-1164 has demonstrated a creative and artistic side through various hobbies, including painting, drawing, and writing.

SCP-1164 has been observed to use his artistic skills as a form of manipulation or distraction. He has been known to create works of art with hidden messages or coded language, and has used his artistic expression to distract or deceive his enemies. While SCP-1164's artistic abilities may seem benign, they represent a tool in his arsenal of manipulation and control, and must be monitored accordingly.

SCP-1164 is known to engage in conversation with Foundation personnel, often attempting to bargain or exchange information for his own benefit. It is important to note that SCP-1164 is a highly skilled liar and manipulator, and all interactions with him should be regarded with suspicion.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-1164 attempted to escape containment during a routine transfer to another facility. He displayed extreme violence, injuring several security personnel before being subdued through the use of lethal force. As a result, all interactions with SCP-1164 are to be approached with extreme caution, and lethal force is authorized in the event of a containment breach.
