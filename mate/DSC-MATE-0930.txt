SCP-930 is a humanoid creature designated as a fashion designer. The subject is a female human with distinctive orange stripes adorning her face and a purple lip. Her eyes bear orange eyebrows, and she dons a green hairdo covered by a purple cap. Green cross-shaped earrings pierce her lobes, and a medical mask veils her mouth. 

Though SCP-930 exhibits human qualities, her love for adventure sets her apart. Her thrill-seeking tendencies manifest in daring pursuits, making for amusing anecdotes of surviving near-death experiences, such as bungee jumping, or mistakenly wandering in the wilderness. 

Related personnel are urged to be cautious when interacting with SCP-930, as the subject may try to persuade and cajole them to participate in dangerous endeavors. Any requests of this nature should be declined, as SCP-930's recklessness could result in injury or worse.
