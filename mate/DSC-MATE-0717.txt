Item #: SCP-717

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-717 is to be kept under constant surveillance in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any attempts at impulsive behavior are to be immediately reported to on-duty personnel for proper handling. No personnel are to engage in casual conversation with SCP-717 without proper authorization and protection.

Description: SCP-717 is a female human that currently works as a banker. SCP-717's most notable features are the orange stripes on her face and her constant smile. SCP-717 often wears normal glasses and her head resembles that of a 00s school girl. She is also usually seen wearing one gold earring and a medical mask covering her mouth. SCP-717's gold chain is her only accessory.

SCP-717's impulsive nature makes her a difficult subject to work with. Despite being warned of the consequences that come along with unrestrained behavior, SCP-717 shows no signs of holding back. Her tendency to act on emotions rather than logic can lead to unexpected and often amusing situations that the people around her find entertaining. SCP-717's behavior also poses a risk to the Foundation, as it makes her difficult to predict and control.

Addendum: Based on recent findings, it's been discovered that SCP-717's impulsive behavior is heavily influenced by the phases of the moon. Further research is currently being conducted.
