Item #: SCP-2699

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2699 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a two-way communication system. Interaction with SCP-2699 is limited to authorized personnel only. SCP-2699 is to be allowed to leave their containment chamber for work purposes only and must be accompanied at all times by at least two security personnel.

Description: SCP-2699 appears to be a human male in his late 20s. SCP-2699 stands at approximately 6 feet in height and weighs approximately 200 pounds. SCP-2699's most notable feature is his spotted face with a contagious smile. SCP-2699 has parted pink hair, which appears to be a unique genetic anomaly. SCP-2699 also bears a two-color band on his forehead and wears a gold earring and chain as accessories. SCP-2699 can often be seen with a candy stick in his mouth.

SCP-2699 is a police officer who possesses a strong sense of empathy and is often very attuned to the emotions of others. This ability can lead to humorous situations as SCP-2699 knows just the right thing to say to make someone feel better, and helps others see the humor in difficult situations. SCP-2699's empathy, however, can also cause emotional distress if not properly managed.

SCP-2699's emotional empathy has been observed to have an effect on others around him. SCP-2699 can cause an emotional attachment towards him, urging others to follow his lead, and to take actions that they would not normally be inclined to take. SCP-2699 is not aware of this effect, and there is no indication that SCP-2699 is able to control or manipulate it.

Addendum: Due to SCP-2699's strong empathic abilities, it has been suggested that he be considered for the SCP Support Staff program, where he can provide emotional support for SCP personnel. Request for reclassification pending.
