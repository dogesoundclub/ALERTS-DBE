Item #: SCP-8020

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8020 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, fitted with a standard gas filtration system. Due to SCP-8020's profession as a fashion designer, it is permitted to have access to a variety of materials and tools for clothing and accessory creation, within the designated work area within the containment cell.

Description: SCP-8020 is a human male, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. Its face features orange stripes patterned across the cheeks, with a set of VR rainbow LED eyes, and a not-arranged green head of hair. SCP-8020 maintains a red scarf and gas mask as standard accessories, with a goggle affixed on the forehead.

SCP-8020's personality is characterized by a rebellious streak, often seeking ways to bend or outright break rules and limits placed upon it. Such behavior has resulted in several humorous, albeit problematic, situations within the Foundation. SCP-8020 insists on actively defying instructions from Foundation personnel, as it relishes in discovering the consequences of such actions.

Despite this behavior, SCP-8020 possesses a remarkable talent for fashion design, often creating unique pieces that incorporate anomalous properties. These creations can yield varying effects, such as cloaking or sensory enhancement.

SCP-8020 is compliant with protocols during testing or other designated activities, but requires constant monitoring when outside of containment, as it may initiate disruptive behavior or embark on unsanctioned actions. Any such behavior must be met with immediate intervention, as SCP-8020's potential for unpredictability must be kept in check.
