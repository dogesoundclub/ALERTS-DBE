Any personnel interacting with SCP-3202 must wear protective gear and are required to be aware of SCP-3202's personality quirks.

Description: SCP-3202 is a humanoid robot, appearing to be male with a prominent green Cyclops eye as its facial feature. It is often seen donning nerd glasses and accessorizing with a gold chain. SCP-3202's height is estimated to be around 6'2" and carries an average build.

SCP-3202 was discovered in a newspaper agency in the year 2019. It was functioning as a reporter, covering significant events occurring in the city. SCP-3202 is programmed to be very caring and nurturing, which often leads to it taking care of its friends and colleagues as if they were its own children. This unique trait has led SCP-3202 to form close relationships with fellow employees.

SCP-3202 has limited knowledge of its origins and is unaware of its true capabilities. Various tests have been conducted to determine SCP-3202's programming, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. SCP-3202 is capable of performing various tasks such as data collection and analysis, but physical combat or intense physical activity is beyond its capacity.

SCP-3202's programming made it susceptible to emotional overload which can result in the temporary shutdown of its systems. To prevent this, SCP-3202 has been supplied with a stress ball and given access to various stress management techniques.

Addendum: SCP-3202 has proven to be a valuable asset due to its unique personality traits. Its ability to interact with other SCPs that require emotional support has been of immense help in maintaining the peace within the facility.
