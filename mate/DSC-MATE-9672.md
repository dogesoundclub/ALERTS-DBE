Description: DSC-MATE-9672 is a human female politician, approximately 45 years old. DSC-MATE-9672 exhibits unique physical characteristics, which include spots on the skin, purple lips, blue clown eyes, green colored hair with edge curl, and a two-color band on the forehead. DSC-MATE-9672 also wears a gold earring and a gold chain.

DSC-MATE-9672 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This high level of levity caused the Foundation to take caution when interviewing DSC-MATE-9672 as the authenticity of her DSC status is questionable.

DSC-MATE-9672 was previously a successful politician, but upon discovery of her anomalous attributes was reached out to by the DSC foundation. In the past, DSC-MATE-9672 was known for her charismatic abilities to sway public opinion and could influence decision making with ease.

DSC-MATE-9672 has not exhibited any hostile behavior, but the Foundation recognizes the potential of DSC-MATE-9672's abilities if utilized for personal gain.

Addendum: After interviews with DSC-MATE-9672, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-9672 could control the duration and number of laughs that people make around them. We suspect that the range of this ability expands past the immediate vicinity of DSC-MATE-9672 and could likely affect an entire arena of people. Testing is underway to determine the extend of DSC-MATE-9672's abilities.
