Item #: 1793-J
Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: As 1793 is a notorious villain responsible for multiple heinous acts against humanity, its containment must be secured at all times. It is to be housed in a reinforced steel cell with a minimum of 2 armed guards at all times. Additionally, the cell must be lined with soundproof materials as 1793 has a loud and intimidating voice which can induce fear in anyone without proper protection. Any attempts made by 1793 to escape must be terminated immediately using tranquilizer darts.

Description: 1793 is a male tiger of unknown origin standing at 8ft tall in its bipedal form. It appears to have red clown eyes, which it uses to seemingly hypnotize its victims during its various crimes. 1793 is often seen wearing a police cap and has a goggle on its forehead as a fashion accessory. It also sports a gold chain and a whistle, which it uses to signal its henchmen. 

The subject displays a distinctive personality trait of having an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. It is often found reading and researching obscure topics and enjoys sharing this newfound knowledge with others. Despite its academic interests, it is equally as ruthless and cunning in its criminal pursuits. 

1793 has shown numerous times that it can communicate effectively in human language and has interacted with law enforcement officials in negotiations in the past. Its voice is loud and intimidating due to its vocal cords being much stronger than those of a normal tiger. 

Addendum: Despite its criminal activities, 1793 seems to be interested in the SCP Foundation and has made several attempts to acquire classified documents relating to it. It is suggested that these attempts be monitored closely, as 1793 could potentially use the information obtained for its own sinister purposes.
