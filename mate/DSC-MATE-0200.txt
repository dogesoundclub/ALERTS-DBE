Item #: 200

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-200, known publicly as a firefighter, must maintain his job as a cover story for his anomalous nature. He is to report to the Foundation weekly for evaluation and to ensure his behavior remains stable. If any changes occur, the Foundation agents are to detain him for further observation. SCP-200's monkey species provides him with extreme agility and strength. 

Description: SCP-200 is a male monkey dressed in a firefighter uniform with a doge hat on his head. The entity is known to wear a silver chain around his neck. SCP-200's eyes are unknown due to his uniform, but he possesses exceptional sight and hearing abilities. SCP-200 also exhibits enhanced senses of smell and touch. He has a generally cheerful disposition, but can become emotionally unstable if reminded of his captivity.

Personality: SCP-200 is good-natured and helpful by nature. However, he can be absent-minded and forgetful at times, especially if he is lost in thought or occupied with a project. SCP-200's forgetfulness has been studied, and it is determined that he forgets appointments, meetings and generally finds himself losing track of time. Staff is advised to check SCP-200's schedule frequently to ensure he maintains his job's appointed work hours.

Addendum: SCP-200 has reported that he has dreams and feels like he is part of the Foundation. As a result, in his times of stress or containment, he may chant the SCP Foundation's name or slogan. Further research is necessary to understand the monkeyâ€™s connection to the Foundation beyond his containment.
