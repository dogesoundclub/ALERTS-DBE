Item #: SCP-8188

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8188 is to be monitored regularly to avoid unexpected incidents. SCP-8188 is currently employed as a train driver, and his daily activities are to be supervised discreetly by Foundation operatives. SCP-8188 is not to be allowed to interact with individuals outside his profession or visit any remote areas alone.

Description: SCP-8188 is a male human with a peculiar facial feature identified as a "Mouth Spot." SCP-8188's other facial feature, a "Frightened Mouth," appears when he feels threatened or is in a high-stress environment. SCP-8188 is commonly seen wearing normal glasses, sporting peak spikes on his head, and has a jade earring on his right ear. He also wears a gold chain and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-8188 possesses exceptional observational and attention ability, making him an excellent gift-giver. However, his perfectionistic tendencies can lead to long periods of indecisiveness when selecting a present for someone.

SCP-8188 was discovered after he had an encounter with a previously contained SCP, which resulted in SCP-8188 being able to see and interact with anomalous entities. After extensive evaluation, it was found that SCP-8188's innate observation skills and ability to read micro-expressions allow him to detect and identify anomalies that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

Addendum: Experimentation with SCP-8188 and machine-learning algorithms yielded impressive results. The AI was trained to identify and predict anomalies that SCP-8188 would be able to observe within an environment. Results showed increased efficiency in the identification and containment of SCPs, thus furthering our goals at the Foundation. Any potential application of SCP-8188 in terms of order-of-battle formation is to be discussed with O5-Command before implementation.
