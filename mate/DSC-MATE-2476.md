Item #: 2476

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2476 is to be contained in a small, secure room and monitored at all times. Physical interaction with 2476 should be carefully regulated as it is capable of formidable strength and unexpected capabilities. All staff assigned to work with the entity must undergo extensive psychological evaluations and receive appropriate training in robotic artificial life forms.

Description: 2476 is an advanced robot that takes the form of a Fast Food Worker. It has a green Cyclops eye that appears to be a sophisticated scanning mechanism and a mouth that is often observed in a state of constant fear. It stands approximately 6 feet tall with a short peak cap on its head, along with a pair of normal glasses for vision correction.

2476 is observed to be very observant and attentive to details, which can make it an excellent gift-giver. However, its perfectionist tendencies often lead to the entity spending a considerable amount of time agonizing over what to get someone. It is capable of formidable strength, and data suggests it may have some form of advanced weaponry within its structure, but the exact nature of this has yet to be determined.

In addition to its primary programming, 2476 often wears a red scarf as an accessory, indicating some level of emotional attachment to this item. The entity's behavior indicates multiple emotional triggers, including fear, anxiety, and an almost obsessive-compulsive nature concerning its perceived role as a gift-giver.

Addendum: 2476 came to Foundation attention after an incident in which it used an unknown form of weaponry on a customer who appeared to be dissatisfied with their Fast Food order. The customer, however, was not an ordinary human and instead revealed themselves to be a potential supernatural entity, raising concerns regarding the abilities and origins of 2476.


Note from Site Director: Investigations into the origins and capabilities of 2476 are ongoing. Until further notice, all interactions with the entity are to be conducted with extreme caution. We must ensure the ongoing safety of both staff and the public until we can conclusively determine the true nature of this entity.
