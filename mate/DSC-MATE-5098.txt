Item #: 5098

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP 5098 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-19. The atmosphere in the chamber should be maintained at a standard temperature and humidity level, and must be equipped with standard amenities for the comfort of SCP 5098.

SCP 5098 is to be provided with a steady supply of fruits, nuts, and fresh vegetables as per its dietary requirements. Access to items such as cigarettes and silver chains must be monitored, and any unauthorized item is to be confiscated.

Description: SCP 5098 is a male monkey who possesses a charming personality that can be quite alluring. SCP 5098 has red clown eyes and a mouth that often seems frightened, adding to its already eerie appearance. SCP 5098 wears a retro cap and a silver chain as accessories and is often seen smoking cigarettes.

SCP 5098 is a jovial and outgoing character that enjoys interacting with others. Due to its playful nature, SCP 5098 has been a story-teller and comedian for most of its life. SCP 5098's stories and jokes are incredibly funny, and when relayed by SCP 5098, often elicit uncontrollable laughter from its audience.

SCP 5098's ability to connect with people makes it an able journalist and reporter, qualities that the Foundation takes advantage of. SCP 5098's work predominantly involves covering news stories that cater to the supernatural and paranormal topics. SCP 5098 has access to a discreet camera, which it uses to capture first-hand reports of paranormal activities.

SCP 5098's outgoing nature, however, has led to instances where it has intentionally caused alarm, confusion, or enabled the escape of other SCPs. Due to these incidents, SCP 5098's containment has been described as integral in the maintenance of site security.

Addendum: SCP 5098's personality is beginning to shift towards darker tendencies, causing the Foundation to monitor its behavior more closely. Any potential radicalization will be met with strict containment procedures.
