SCP-5712, codenamed "Hopper" is a highly trained Security Guard with a unique genetic trait that has turned him into a humanoid rabbit. With his bright blue clown eyes and retro cap, Hopper stands out in a crowd, making him perfectly suited for his job as a guard. The silver chain he wears around his neck serves as a reminder of his loyalty to the Foundation.

Despite his adorable appearance, Hopper is a force to be reckoned with. He may have a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but he can also be fiercely protective of his loved ones. In fact, insulting or threatening his friends or family members is a sure-fire way to make him see red. Hopper is not one to back down from a fight, and his razor-sharp claws and lightning-fast reflexes make him a formidable opponent.

But even with his ferocious nature, Hopper never loses his sense of humor. He can often be found cracking jokes and making light of serious situations, which can be both endearing and annoying to those around him. But at the end of the day, Hopper's loyalty and dedication to his job make him one of the most valuable assets in the Foundation's arsenal.
