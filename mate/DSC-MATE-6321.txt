Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6321 is to be closely monitored through surveillance cameras and frequent psychological evaluations. Her place of employment is to remain undisclosed to the general public and any Foundation personnel who are not directly involved with SCP-6321's containment. SCP-6321 is to be given weekly counseling sessions in order to address any rebellious tendencies or conflicts with authority figures.

Description: SCP-6321 is a human female who works as a news anchor. Her birth name is [REDACTED] and she is 34 years old. SCP-6321 is characterized by her bright orange stripes on her cheeks, a wide smile, and VR rainbow LED eyes. She also wears a retro cap and a silver chain as accessories.

SCP-6321 has been observed to have a strong sense of independence and is often resistant to authority or rules she deems unnecessary. This has led to instances of disobedience, such as leaving work early or taking a day off without permission. Despite this, SCP-6321 is highly charismatic and has been known to use her charm to sway others to her way of thinking.

SCP-6321's rebellious behavior and independent nature have caused concern for the Foundation as it may compromise her ability to keep the existence of the supernatural world a secret from the public. Therefore, containment measures must be strictly adhered to in order to prevent any unintended breaches of security.
