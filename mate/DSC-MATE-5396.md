Item #: 5396

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5396 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to its exceptional leadership abilities, it is not to be allowed access to other DSCs, as it may attempt to form a cult of followers. The subject is allowed one hour of supervised exercise time in a designated outdoor enclosure daily, and all activities must be monitored for any unusual behavior. The subject's LED gas mask must be kept in a secure storage locker, and only authorized personnel with level 3 clearance or higher are permitted access to it. Any attempts by subject 5396 to manipulate or control personnel must be reported immediately.

Description:

Subject 5396 is a male monkey of an unknown species, measuring approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighing 60 kilograms. Its fur is a bright green color, giving it a unique and easily identifiable appearance. It possesses a pair of normal glasses for corrective vision, and an LED gas mask which it wears at all times. The gas mask gives off a glowing blue light, presumably for visual effect, although it is not clear what other purposes it may serve.

The defining characteristic of subject 5396 is its innate talent for leadership. It displays an extremely charismatic personality, which allows it to easily influence others and manipulate situations in its favor. It is highly intelligent, and possesses a strategic mind which it utilizes to achieve its goals. It is not known how or why subject 5396 obtained its leadership abilities, but it is clear that it is often drawn to positions of power and control.

Addendum 5396-A:

Subject 5396 was recovered from a circus in [REDACTED] where it had been performing as an attraction. Its abilities were discovered when it incited a riot among the other animals, resulting in the death of several trainers. It was swiftly contained by a Foundation team and has been under observation ever since. It has shown no signs of exhibiting any anomalous abilities beyond its leadership skills, and appears to be of normal intelligence for its species.

Addendum 5396-B:

Recent interviews with subject 5396 have revealed that it harbors a deep hatred for humans and has expressed a desire to "rule over them with an iron fist." It has made several attempts to manipulate Foundation personnel into aiding it in its goals, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. Subject 5396 is considered highly manipulative and dangerous and is to be approached with caution.
