Item #: DSC-MATE-7831

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7831 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All personnel are to avoid direct physical contact with DSC-MATE-7831 unless specified by Level 3 personnel or higher. Under no circumstances is DSC-MATE-7831 to be allowed access to any vehicle without prior approval from Foundation personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-7831 is a female humanoid of average height and weight, identified as a car salesman of non-anomalous origin. Her most notable feature is her purple lip, which appears to be natural and not the result of makeup or an external dye. DSC-MATE-7831 typically wears a choker and a cigarette at all times, often holding it in her mouth even when not actively smoking.

DSC-MATE-7831 displays a unique hairstyle consisting of two pig tails and jade earrings in both ears. Her eyesight appears to be subpar, requiring her to wear normal glasses at all times. When interacting with others, DSC-MATE-7831 displays a tendency to act on impulse and make spontaneous decisions based on her emotions in lieu of thoughtful consideration.

Testing and observations have revealed no apparent anomalous properties, though it is theorized that DSC-MATE-7831 may possess an ability to influence others through her impulsive decisions and the charm she exudes.

Addendum: Incident Report 7831-1

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-7831 was found attempting to steal a Foundation vehicle for personal use. When apprehended, she claimed that she was "just going for a joyride" and appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance. DSC-MATE-7831 was placed in disciplinary confinement for a period of two weeks and granted only supervised access to non-anomalous cigarettes during her stay. Ongoing testing and monitoring of DSC-MATE-7831's behavior is highly recommended to prevent future incidents.
