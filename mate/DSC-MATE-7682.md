Containment Procedures:

Subject 7682 is to be monitored at all times by at least two agents, one of which must be a Class-2 cognitive specialist. Any changes in behavior or appearance must be reported immediately to the supervisor in charge of the case. The subject is not to be left unattended in public for an extended period of time.

Description:

Subject 7682 appears to be a male of the human species, around 35 years of age. He works as a car salesman in a local dealership and is known to be very charismatic and charming. However, there are some notable features that must be taken into account when dealing with this individual.

Subject 7682's most distinguishing facial feature is his perpetual smile, which seems to be ever-present, even in stressful situations. His eyes are an unnatural shade of blue, reminiscent of clown makeup, and his ears bear a green cross-shaped earring.

Additionally, the subject has been spotted wearing a medical mask in public. Whether this is due to personal preference or a means of masking any anomalous properties is yet to be confirmed.

Subject 7682 is known to wear a silver chain around his neck, although its significance is yet to be determined.

Personality:

Subject 7682 has a tendency to be extremely caring and nurturing, often taking care of his friends and family members as if they were his own children. This has led to humorous situations in the past, particularly when he insists on tucking people in at night or making sure they've eaten enough.

While his personality is generally kind and upbeat, agents have reported a certain degree of dissociation when dealing with stressful situations. More research is needed to determine if this is due to an underlying condition or an anomalous property.
