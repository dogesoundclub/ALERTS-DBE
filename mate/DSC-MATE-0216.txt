Item #: SCP-216

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-216 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls, specifically designed to withstand physical damage. The containment chamber should be equipped with a ventilation system that filters out airborne bacteria and viruses. The subject's VR Jade LED eyes and Red Cross Earring are to be removed for security purposes. In the event that SCP-216 requires medical attention, all medical personnel must wear protective gear to prevent potential contamination.

SCP-216 is not allowed contact with any electronic devices due to the possibility of dangerous hacking attempts. Communication with SCP-216 must be strictly monitored and limited to authorized personnel.

Description: SCP-216 is a humanoid entity with the appearance of a female car salesman. The subject has a well-maintained smile and is known to wear a medical mask over their mouth. A goggle is frequently seen on the subject's forehead. Further examination indicates that the subject possesses unique augmented reality capabilities through their jade LED eyes, allowing them to identify the most suitable means of persuasion for any given circumstance.

Despite the humanoid appearance, SCP-216 is known to exhibit dangerous hacking abilities, giving them complete control over various electronic devices. When disarmed, the subject is highly organised and dependable, earning them the trust of their clients. However, SCP-216 can be quite stubborn, making it challenging for them to let go of their routines or accept new ideas. SCP-216 possesses an unusual affinity towards automobiles, with the ability to identify and deduce every flaw or advantage of a vehicle with a single glance.

Addendum 216-A: Due to the subject's exceptional ability in selling cars, various high-profile car retailers within the United States have shown interest in employing SCP-216. However, their unique abilities pose a significant security risk, warranting continued containment.
