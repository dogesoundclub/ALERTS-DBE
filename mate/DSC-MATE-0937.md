DSC-MATE-937, codenamed "The Empath," is a female human train driver with striking orange stripes on her face and vibrant purple lips. Her eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LEDs, providing her with enhanced vision and a striking appearance. She is easily recognized by the green cross earring she wears in one of her ears, symbolizing her respect for all forms of life. Her personality is marked by a deep empathy and understanding for others, which can sometimes lead to emotional outbursts when witnessing others' pain or suffering. Despite this, she remains steadfast in her duties, showing impressive grit and determination in the face of adversity. The choker that she wears around her neck is believed to have mystical properties, although testing has so far proved inconclusive. In addition to her compassion for others, she has a fondness for animals and nature, and can often be found tending to her large collection of plants when not working. DSC-MATE-937 is a valued member of our urban fantasy community, and her dedication to her work and her fellow creatures make her an asset to our team.
