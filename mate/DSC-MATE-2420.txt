Item #: SCP-2420

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2420 is to be employed as a delivery driver for SCP sites, with limited access to areas that house sensitive materials. Communication devices on vehicles driven by SCP-2420 are to be monitored, and any suspicious activity must be reported to the Site Director immediately. SCP-2420 must undergo monthly psychological evaluations to assess emotional stability and mental state.

Description: SCP-2420 is a male human with nerd glasses and parted pink hair, and wears a jade earring on their left ear. SCP-2420 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and is often attuned to the emotions of others. Observations suggest that SCP-2420 can feel the emotions of others, which can lead to unusual situations. SCP-2420 has shown no signs of exhibiting any anomalous abilities.

Personality: SCP-2420 has a kind and amiable personality, often offering help and support to others. SCP-2420's attunement to others' emotions enables them to calm or encourage those in need. SCP-2420 often humorously diffuses tense situations and can read a situation's nuances quickly. SCP-2420 has an excellent driving record and has never been implicated in misconduct.

SCP-2420's employment with the Foundation has shown no indication of any intentional attempts to breach containment. However, their heightened sensitivity to others may prove to be a liability, and as such, their movements and access must be restricted.
