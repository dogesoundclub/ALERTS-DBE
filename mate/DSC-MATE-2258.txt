Item #: 2258

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2258 is to be monitored for potential anomalous behavior as it continues to hold its position as a Traffic Officer for the city. Any deviation from standard protocol is to be reported to the Site Director immediately and Item 2258 is to be taken into custody for further experimentation.

Description: Item 2258 is a human female with striking orange stripes on her face and electric blue clown eyes. Her trademark green hair is perpetually styled with curling edges and she possesses a set of goggles on her forehead as well as a green cross earring in each ear. She is invariably seen wearing a gas mask, which appears to be of standard make.

Personality: Item 2258 is excessively conscientious and has an innate ability to detect and observe minor details. However, this feature also presents as a personality trait that causes it to be fixated on perfection and an overwhelming desire to give the perfect gift. It may waste significant amounts of time agonizing over which gift to purchase for someone.

Addendum: During routine patrol, Item 2258 exhibited anomalous behavior as it was able to detect potential breaches in containment protocols relating to unknown SCP items. Item 2258 demonstrated the ability to track down the source of anomalies without prior knowledge of their existence. Further experiments are needed to identify the extent of Item 2258's anomalous properties.
