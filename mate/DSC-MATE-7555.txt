SCP Foundation Containment Report

Item #: SCP-7555

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7555 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Her movements are to be monitored via CCTV, as she has displayed a tendency to wander off and become lost in thought. SCP-7555 is to be kept away from any reflective surfaces or objects that may distort her clown-like blue eyes, as these have been known to cause visual disturbances in those who stare at them for prolonged periods. Any individuals who come into direct contact with SCP-7555 must undergo immediate psychological evaluation.

Description: SCP-7555 is a female human police officer with a striking appearance. SCP-7555's most notable feature is her red lips, which are always painted to a high gloss. Her hair is blonde and her head appears to bear a large wing on the right side. SCP-7555â€™s clown-like blue eyes often appear to be oversized and usually draw attention to themselves. SCP-7555's ears are adorned with a red cross earring, and she wears a silver chain around her neck. Her personal style and appearance can be described as flamboyant and attention-grabbing, making her stand out in a crowd.

SCP-7555 displays a tendency towards introspection and spends a significant amount of time lost in thought. This can result in her being unaware of her surroundings, leading to several accidents where she walks into a pole, trips over something or collides with an object. SCP-7555's personality is generally positive, and she values composure, professionalism, and justice. However, it should be noted that SCP-7555's thought processes may make her easily manipulated or susceptible to coercion, which is why psychological evaluation of any individual that comes into direct contact with SCP-7555 is mandatory.

Addendum: SCP-7555 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of strange events that coincided with her arrival in various jurisdictions. These reports included mass hallucinations, electrical malfunctions, and the appearance of unusual creatures. The Foundation has initiated further study into the possible anomalous properties of SCP-7555.
