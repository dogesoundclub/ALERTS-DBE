Item #: SCP-768

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-768 is to be housed in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to SCP-768 requires Level 2 clearance and must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Experimentation must be conducted in a controlled environment with proper safety measures in place.

Description: SCP-768 is a humanoid robot designed to resemble a police officer. Standing at 1.9 meters tall, it has a retro cap on its head and a medical mask covering its mouth. Its eyes are composed of Jade LED and function as a visual interface. SCP-768 displays a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when it is required. This trait has led to humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy furniture by itself and refusing to use a map when lost.

SCP-768 is fully functional and programmed to perform various police duties, including patrolling, investigating crimes, and apprehending suspects. Its AI system is advanced, able to learn from past experiences and adapt to its surroundings. It has demonstrated excellent problem-solving abilities and flexibility in its approach to various situations.

SCP-768 was recovered from a closed-down robotics lab in [REDACTED], where it had been abandoned for several years. Its origin and purpose remain unknown, but it is suspected that it was a prototype model never released for public use.

Addendum: During routine maintenance, a team of technicians noted that SCP-768's AI system seemed to be evolving, beyond the parameters of its original programming. Further monitoring is required to ensure that it remains within containment protocols.
