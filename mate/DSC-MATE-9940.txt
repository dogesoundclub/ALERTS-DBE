Item #: 9940

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9940 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a specialized climate control system designed to simulate a natural rabbit habitat. All interactions with SCP-9940 are to be conducted remotely, using audio and video equipment to facilitate communication. SCP-9940 is not to be allowed access to any electronic devices, as they have been shown to cause aggressive behavior.

Description: SCP-9940 is a male rabbit of undetermined age and origin. SCP-9940 displays average intelligence and communication skills, and is capable of using basic computer programs. SCP-9940 wears glasses and has green fur that is not arranged. SCP-9940 also wears a gold earring and can often be seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-9940 is generally docile when in the presence of humans, but has been known to exhibit aggressive behavior when exposed to electronic devices or other forms of technology. When not agitated, SCP-9940 has a playful personality and enjoys telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through their family or community. SCP-9940 values tradition and has a no-nonsense attitude, which can sometimes lead to humorous situations.

Addendum: Due to SCP-9940's unpredictable behavior when exposed to technology, all electronic devices in SCP-9940's containment chamber have been replaced with analog systems. Additionally, SCP-9940's environment is fitted with a high-security perimeter to prevent unauthorized access. Further studies are ongoing to determine the origin and true nature of SCP-9940.
