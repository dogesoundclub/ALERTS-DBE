Item #: SCP-1840

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1840 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-1840 is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel or higher, and all interactions with SCP-1840 must be conducted via a communication system. All requests made by SCP-1840 must be reviewed and approved by at least two Level 4 researchers.

Description: SCP-1840 is a male rabbit with green hair and a purple cap, measuring approximately 1 meter in height. The entity possesses a distinctive two-color band on its forehead, as well as a gold earring and chain. SCP-1840 is a news anchor by profession, and is highly adept at public speaking and improvisation.

SCP-1840 possesses a highly creative and inventive personality, regularly suggesting outlandish solutions to problems simply for the sake of amusement. This behavior has led to several humorous incidents during containment, but also poses a potential security risk in the event of an emergency.

Given SCP-1840's natural tendency towards brainstorming and the generation of new ideas, researchers have explored the possibility of utilizing SCP-1840 as a consultant for the development of new containment procedures and technologies. However, special care must be taken to ensure that SCP-1840's behavior does not pose a threat to Foundation personnel or operations. 

Addendum: During a recent interaction with SCP-███, SCP-1840 requested access to several research documents related to the development of a new containment protocol. The request was ultimately approved by supervising researchers, but this incident serves as a reminder of SCP-1840's ongoing curiosity and interest in Foundation procedures and operations. Monitoring of SCP-1840's interactions with outside entities is strongly advised.
