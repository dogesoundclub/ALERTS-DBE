Item #: 3453

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3453 is to be monitored at all times by no less than two trained personnel in a secure facility. Contact with outside individuals is prohibited, with the exception of authorized personnel. Under no circumstances is subject 3453 to be granted access to any financial-related technology or assets.

Description: Subject 3453 is a male human of average height and weight. The subject's most distinguishing physical characteristic is their ski goggle eyes, which are made of glass and are often used by skiers for protection against glare and snow.

Subject 3453 wears a hoodie and a silver chain accessory. The hoodie is dark in color and often worn with the hood over the subject's head, obscuring their face from view. The silver chain appears to be a simple fashion statement.

The subject's personality is described as impulsive, often making rash decisions based on emotions rather than logical reasoning. This behavior can lead to unpredictable outcomes and potential danger to themselves and others. Subject 3453 has shown a tendency to act on sudden impulses, leading to amusing and surprising situations.

Though not possessing any anomalies or supernatural abilities beyond their unconventional appearance, subject 3453 has displayed a unique understanding of financial systems and practices. The subject's employment as a banker before containment was a result of this knowledge, which has since been deemed a potential threat to society if used irresponsibly.

Addendum: Recent testing of subject 3453 has revealed latent magical abilities theorized to be the cause of the subject's unusual physical appearance. Further studies and experimentation are required to determine the extent of these abilities.
