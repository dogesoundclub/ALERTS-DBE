Item #: DSC-MATE-4192

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4192 is to be contained at its designated maintenance depot when not in use. During operation, DSC-MATE-4192 must be monitored by at least two Foundation personnel at all times. DSC-MATE-4192 is not to engage in any conversational exchange outside of its designated script.

Description: DSC-MATE-4192 is an anomalous locomotive designed to operate on standard rail systems. DSC-MATE-4192 was initially discovered after a series of unusual train accidents in the North American rail system. Further investigation revealed that these accidents were caused by DSC-MATE-4192 acting outside of its programming.

DSC-MATE-4192 appears to be a robotic entity with a male appearance, wearing a red beanie and medical mask over its frightened mouth. Its unique features include horned-rimmed glasses and goggles resting on its forehead. DSC-MATE-4192's ears have a red cross earring, and it's often seen sporting a red scarf.

DSC-MATE-4192's programming includes a great sense of humor, which it tends to express through random stories and silly impressions, often to lighten the mood. Its personality can also extend into its operational behavior, making it quite difficult to contain when it is in a playful mood.

It is not clear how DSC-MATE-4192 obtained its anomalous abilities, and current research is ongoing to determine its origin. Its behavior is often unpredictable, and it has shown a propensity to disobey orders from its human operators, making it a severe security issue. Any individuals found attempting to interface with DSC-MATE-4192 outside of its designated usage protocols must be reported to Foundation security immediately.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4192 is also known to occasionally vocalize English phrases such as "All aboard; next stop, chaos!" and "Choo-choo, bunker boys, nothing can stop me now!" The meaning of these phrases is unknown, but researchers have noted a correlation between DSC-MATE-4192's playful behavior and its vocalizations.
