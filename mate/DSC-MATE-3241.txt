Item #: SCP-3241

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3241 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber, equipped with appropriate rabbit-friendly amenities such as bedding, food, and toys. A daily check by a Level 2 personnel must be performed every 24 hours to ensure SCP-3241's well-being. Any personnel entering SCP-3241's chamber must comply with all safety protocols and must not be carrying any food or drinks. Any visitors that enter SCP-3241's presence must be screened by security beforehand to avoid causing unintentional distress to the subject.

Description: SCP-3241 is a male rabbit standing at 43 cm in height and weighing 1.6 kg. The subject wears a police cap and a pair of horned rim glasses, and sports a gold earring on his left ear. SCP-3241's most noticeable facial feature is its frightened mouth which is always open, revealing its two front teeth. SCP-3241 has a goggle on its forehead and is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck. SCP-3241 is also known to carry a whistle at all times.

SCP-3241's most significant anomalous property is its ability to act and communicate like a human being. SCP-3241 claims to be a journalist, specifically a reporter often seen delivering a daily news bulletin from its containment chamber. SCP-3241's delivery style is described as comical, using humor to keep its audience engaged. It enjoys telling stories and performing humorous impersonations to lighten the mood. SCP-3241's upbeat and friendly nature makes it a very likeable character.

Addendum 3241-1: SCP-3241's origins are currently unknown, and the subject refuses to disclose any information regarding its previous life. SCP-3241's humor has made interviewing it a challenging task, as the subject is likely to derail any attempt at a serious conversation with a joke or a pun. The Foundation has yet to determine if SCP-3241's funny demeanor is part of its anomalous properties or if it is part of its personality.

Addendum 3241-2: SCP-3241's containment chamber was recently decorated with posters of various cartoon characters, compliments of Dr. █████ who noticed SCP-3241's apparent interest in animated shows. SCP-3241's behavior post-decoration seemed to indicate an improvement in the subject's quality of life, resulting in consistent news updates with a visibly happier SCP-3241. Currently, SCP-3241's containment chamber is slated for regular cleaning by the janitorial staff who often express enjoyment in the conversations they have with the friendly SCP.
