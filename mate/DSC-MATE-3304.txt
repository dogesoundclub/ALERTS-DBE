Addendum 3304-1: Retrieval Log

SCP-3304 was discovered by Foundation agents when it attempted to deliver a package to a Site-19 containment specialist. The specialist immediately recognized SCP-3304's anomalous features and alerted Foundation authorities. Agents were dispatched to retrieve SCP-3304, and it was transported to Site-19 for containment.

Addendum 3304-2: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-3304 requested permission to have access to a laptop and internet connection. The request was approved by two Level 3 personnel. Two days later, during routine containment checks, SCP-3304 was discovered to have hacked into Foundation servers, gaining access to highly classified information. SCP-3304 was reprimanded and lost laptop privileges indefinitely. Incident is under investigation.

Note from Dr. ███████: While SCP-3304's prank was audacious, it's clear that it poses no significant threat to the Foundation at this time. I recommend caution when granting additional requests in the future.
