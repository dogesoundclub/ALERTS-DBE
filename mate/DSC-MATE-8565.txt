Item #: SCP-8565

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8565 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. They are allowed to continue their work as a fashion designer, but must submit all designs for screening to ensure they do not contain any anomalous properties. SCP-8565 may be allowed access to inanimate objects for their nurturing tendencies, but any attempts at anthropomorphization are strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-8565 is a humanoid female of average height and weight. Their face features orange stripes, with red lips. SCP-8565's eyes glow with a VR rainbow LED, and they often wear rainbow festival attire with gold earrings and a silver chain.

Personality-wise, SCP-8565 displays a very nurturing and caring nature. They have been observed to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, giving them names and expressing empathy towards them. This behavior does not appear to be malicious in nature, but rather a deep-seated need to care for all things around them.

SCP-8565's anomalous properties manifest in their designs. Any clothing designed by SCP-8565 seems to have a soothing effect on those who wear it, promoting feelings of comfort and safety. However, prolonged exposure to the clothing can lead to excessive attachment and obsessive behavior towards the wearer. As such, all designs must be screened and approved by Site-██'s containment specialists.

Addendum: Unapproved designs created by SCP-8565 have led to several containment breaches in the past. These breaches have resulted in multiple injuries and fatalities. Care must be taken when dealing with SCP-8565, as their benign nature can sometimes mask the potential danger of their creations.
