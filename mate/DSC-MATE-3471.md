Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3471 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. DSC-MATE-3471 is not to be allowed to leave its containment without proper authorization and armed escort. All personnel handling DSC-MATE-3471 are to wear full protective gear at all times, including face shields and gloves. Any breaches or symptoms of infection are to be reported immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-3471 is a male monkey wearing a police uniform and sporting a pair of shade glasses and a gold earring on one ear. DSC-MATE-3471 appears to be sentient and capable of communication, with a demonstrated preference for verbal communication.

DSC-MATE-3471 is a highly analytical and logical individual, often engaging others in debates or arguments for amusement. Despite its appearance, DSC-MATE-3471 is quite skilled in enforcing traffic laws and maintaining order on busy city streets. However, when in the presence of its fellow primates, DSC-MATE-3471 exhibits territorial and aggressive behavior.

DSC-MATE-3471 has displayed an unusual ability to alter the behavior of other primates while in urban areas. This has led to several incidents of primates ignoring traffic laws, causing accidents and putting human life in danger. DSC-MATE-3471 is believed to be capable of transmitting a form of biological contagion through the air that can alter primate behavior.

Addendum: Containment breach incident reports suggest that DSC-MATE-3471 may be capable of convincing other primates to assist it in escaping containment. Any personnel reporting unusual alterations in behavior or attempting to assist DSC-MATE-3471 in escape will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
