Description: Item 6152 is a male monkey of the Macaca species, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. The monkey has a frightened mouth and is often seen wearing horned rimmed glasses. Its head is covered with a red beanie and is marked with a two-color band while a goggle rests on its forehead. It also sports a gold earring and wears both a red scarf and a gas mask.

The monkey has a quirky personality, and its behavior can be unpredictable. Itâ€™s absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time and appointments. Item 6152's ability to talk is yet to be proven, so communication takes place through sign language.

Item 6152 is employed as a delivery driver, and as per its job role, it transports items to and from the foundation's facilities. However, due to its tendency to get distracted, reminders have been put in place to ensure Item 6152 follows its designated delivery routes. Its air-filtering gas mask and goggles on its forehead make it ideal for transportation of hazardous materials.

Addendum: Item 6152 has formed a bond with Item 5349, the talking parrot. The duo often communicates in sign language and appears to be forming a deep, platonic relationship. Observations on this relationship are ongoing.
