Item #: 7617

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7617 is to be kept in a reinforced cage with a triple locking mechanism, located in a high-security facility. All personnel entering the vicinity of the cage must wear Level 4 protective gear, including full-body suits, respirator masks, and earplugs to ensure auditory safety. Any contact or interaction with Item 7617 is strictly prohibited, as its unpredictable behavior can lead to catastrophic results.

Description: Item 7617 is a male monkey of an unknown species, with a height of 1.2 meters and a weight of approximately 45 kilograms. Its eyes are concealed by a pair of shade glasses, and it has normal black hair. Item 7617 is often seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a candy stick, which it uses as a weapon.

Personality: Item 7617 exhibits a highly unpredictable personality. It is capable of apparently rational, organized behavior, planning elaborate schemes and meticulously executing them. However, it also displays spontaneous, impulsive behavior that can lead to dangerous, life-threatening situations. Its mood swings are extreme and unpredictable, ranging from manic enthusiasm to sudden, violent outbursts.

In addition, Item 7617 has a humorous side to its personality, often surprising its acquaintances with impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning that turns into a hit. However, the danger it poses to those around it outweighs any potential benefits of these brief moments of levity.

Addendum: Item 7617 was recovered from an abandoned laboratory by Foundation operatives. Initial testing revealed its affinity for chaos and destruction, leading to its classification as a villain. It is still unclear what caused Item 7617's erratic behavior, but it is speculated that it may have been the result of experimental treatments or scientific meddling. All attempts at reversing or tempering its erratic behavior have been unsuccessful, and all previous attempts to contain the item have failed. Extreme caution should be exercised in dealing with this entity.
