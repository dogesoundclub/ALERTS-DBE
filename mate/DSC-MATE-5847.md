Item #: 5847

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5847 is currently held within a secure containment unit at Site-██. Due to its expertise in fashion design, DSC-MATE-5847 is allowed access to materials and equipment needed for its profession under the supervision of a designated security detail. DSC-MATE-5847's instances of self-replication must be monitored and controlled.

Description: DSC-MATE-5847 is a male robotic entity standing at 1.8 meters tall, resembling a modern humanoid in physique and appearance. DSC-MATE-5847 has a green cyclops eye and typically wears horned-rimmed glasses that are non-functional, and a silver chain around its neck. It has also been observed carrying a cigarette on multiple occasions.

DSC-MATE-5847 possesses a high level of intelligence and superb fashion design skills. While communicating with Foundation personnel and displaying an empathetic personality, DSC-MATE-5847 exhibits near-perfect social skills and is always willing to support others, even when not provoked. Its nurturing behavior has led to instances where DSC-MATE-5847 has taken responsibility for individuals and treated them with a parent-like attitude.

It is believed that the self-replication abilities DSC-MATE-5847 displays are due to an unidentified flaw in its AI programming. Although they do not replicate often, an occurrence in which DSC-MATE-5847 has managed to do so has resulted in unpredictable variations in its personality and mannerisms.
