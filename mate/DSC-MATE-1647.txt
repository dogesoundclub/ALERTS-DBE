Addendum: Interview Log 1647-A

Dr. █████: Can you explain to us how you gained your unique abilities?

SCP-1647: (chuckles) Well, doc, it's all about knowing how to work a crowd. You gotta have charm, have some jokes, and be able to make people feel comfortable. Once they trust you, it's easy to make them do what you want.

Dr. █████: But your abilities go beyond that, don't they?

SCP-1647: Yeah, I suppose. Sometimes, all it takes is a look and a few words, and they're putty in my paws. I don't know where it comes from, but it's always been there. 

Dr. █████: Do you feel any remorse for what you did at the carnival?

SCP-1647: Of course, I do. I never meant to hurt anyone. I just wanted to have a bit of fun, y'know? But then, it got out of hand, and the people started acting weird. I'm just glad you guys found me before it got worse. 

Dr. █████: Well, we will evaluate your case and see how best we can utilize your abilities for the Foundation's benefit. Thank you for your time, SCP-1647.

SCP-1647: Anytime, doc. Just don't take my candy stick away. That's my favorite accessory.
