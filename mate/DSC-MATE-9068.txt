Item #: SCP-9068

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9068 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-9068 is granted only to Level 2 personnel, with supervision from at least one Level 3 guard. Any requests for interaction with SCP-9068 must first be approved by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-9068 is a human male of unspecified age, who self-identifies as a fashion designer. The subject's eyes emit a continuous spectrum of color on a loop, which has been identified as a custom-made LED upgrade. SCP-9068's head is often left in an untamed state of vibrant green. SCP-9068 sports a jade earring on their left ear and accessorizes with a bright red scarf.

SCP-9068 possesses an unusual level of intuition that is atypical of non-anomalous humans. SCP-9068 has demonstrated the ability to predict events before they occur with notable accuracy, leading researchers to hypothesize that SCP-9068 may possess psychic abilities. SCP-9068 also has the ability to detect emotions in those around it with little to no stimuli, making its presence both impressive and unsettling.

SCP-9068's anomalous abilities make monitoring their interaction with personnel a high priority. SCP-9068 tends to be cooperative and amicable with staff. However, it is unknown if SCP-9068's abilities are entirely within their control or if they may experience emotional or mental instability that could cause breaches.

Addendum: Testing has revealed that SCP-9068 has the ability to neutralize certain anomalous abilities in nearby entities, leading researchers to theorize that SCP-9068's abilities have a dampening effect on those around it. Further experiments are being planned to explore this effect in greater detail.
