Item #: SCP-8947

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8947 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Interactions with SCP-8947 require a Level 2 Security Clearance and must be supervised by at least two security personnel.

SCP-8947 is not to be provided with any living or inanimate objects to avoid unnecessary attachment or harm to such items.

Description: SCP-8947 is a male human identified as a real estate agent, previously employed by [REDACTED]. SCP-8947 stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 80 kg. The individual has facial spots and a permanent smile, with eyes that resemble ski goggles. SCP-8947's head features green hair that is not arranged, and a gold earring can be seen on his left earlobe. SCP-8947 is often seen wearing a medical mask and a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-8947 exhibits an anomalous personality trait that causes the individual to express extreme care and nurture towards living and inanimate objects alike. The individual is known to name and talk to cars, plants, and even household appliances, anthropomorphizing them to a significant degree. SCP-8947 may experience distress when any harm is caused to any of these objects.

SCP-8947's anomalous nature does not appear to pose any immediate threat to human life or SCP Foundation operations, but its attachment to inanimate objects requires constant monitoring.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8947 requested that it be allowed to take ownership of a dilapidated building on the outskirts of [REDACTED], stating that it "deserved a new home." After much deliberation, the request was denied due to potential risks that the building may pose in the event of structural failure. SCP-8947 proceeded to become agitated and experienced a period of distress, expressing a desire to "make the building feel loved." This incident further highlights SCP-8947's attachment to inanimate objects, and further monitoring of its behavior is advised.
