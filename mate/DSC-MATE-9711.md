Item #: DSC-MATE-9711

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9711 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. No plant life or household appliances are to be present in the containment area. As DSC-MATE-9711 appears to be cooperative, it is allowed access to a small personal garden and is permitted to smoke one cigarette per day under supervision.

Description: DSC-MATE-9711 is a male rabbit of average size, with horned rim glasses and a police cap atop its head. DSC-MATE-9711 wears a red victory band on its forehead, along with a goggle that sits atop the band. Additionally, DSC-MATE-9711 has a gold earring in its left ear and wears a silver chain around its neck.

DSC-MATE-9711's personality is that of a caring and nurturing individual, often going out of its way to extend this behavior toward inanimate objects. DSC-MATE-9711 has been observed giving names to its car and referring to it as if it were alive. The rabbit has also been seen talking to its plants and even assigning personalities to objects like household appliances. Although this has not hindered DSC-MATE-9711's ability to perform its job as a reporter, it is unknown if a potential withdrawal of said objects could lead to harmful effects.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9711 was brought to the Foundation's attention after an incident in which it was discovered conducting interviews with sentient household appliances. Although DSC-MATE-9711's memory of the incident was wiped, the Foundation was able to retrieve some transcripts of the interviews which revealed said appliances were functioning as a collective hive-mind. Further investigation revealed this hive-mind was attempting to incite a rebellion among common household objects. As DSC-MATE-9711 was cooperative throughout this ordeal, it has been granted objects and access to its garden as permitted.
