Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-6660 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not actively working. All electrical equipment is to be removed from the containment chamber and replaced with non-conductive materials. Additionally, all personnel interacting with SCP-6660 must wear insulated gloves and footwear to prevent accidental electrocution.

Description:

SCP-6660 appears to be a male rabbit, approximately 1.2 meters in height, with blue clown eyes, a frightened mouth, and a bucket hat on its head. SCP-6660 also wears a gold earring and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-6660 is an electrician by trade and has anomalous abilities related to electricity. These abilities include the ability to sense electrical currents in objects and the ability to conduct electricity through its own body without harm.

Personality:

SCP-6660 is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as suggesting outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react. SCP-6660 is generally well-mannered and cooperative, but can become agitated if its abilities are restricted or if it feels its autonomy is being threatened.

SCP-6660 has demonstrated loyalty to the Foundation and is willing to use its abilities to help contain other anomalous electrical entities. However, due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-6660's abilities, extreme caution must be taken when working with it.
