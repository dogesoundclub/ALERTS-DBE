Item #: 8848

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8848 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment unit. They are not to be exposed to any information related to SCP objects, several human-affecting anomalies, or phenomena that may induce strong emotional reactions.

SCP-8848's access to the internet is only allowed for job-related purposes. Any unauthorized contact with online communities, clients, or individuals is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-8848 is a female humanoid, identified as a lawyer by profession. All attempts to measure any anomalous properties or attachments to any known anomalous entities have resulted in negative results. SCP-8848's anomalous behavior manifests itself in their strong emotional responses to individuals' distress and the environment around them.

SCP-8848's appearance features an orange eyebrow coloration, small pigtails, and a goggle on their forehead. SCP-8848's most prominent feature is their smile, in stark contrast to the surgical mask they wear at all times. The origin of this behavior may denote varying degrees of social anxiety and a protective measure against pathogens present in the environment.

SCP-8848's personality is characterized by deep empathy and compassion for the suffering of others, even emotional responses that may seem disproportionate to the event. SCP-8848 also displays affection for animals and natural settings. The anomaly that causes these responses has not been located but may be related to past trauma or an innate quality of SCP-8848.

Addendum 8848-A: Since SCP-8848's containment, they have shown a profound impact on the medical ward, primarily through the interpersonal relationships formed. Dr. Jones noted a significant improvement in the overall well-being of the patients and staff, reducing the need for psychological counseling sessions.

Addendum 8848-B: While SCP-8848's exact anomalous behavior remains unclear, it is recommended that further in-depth psychological evaluations are carried out and observation of both emotional and physical responses is recorded. It is essential to ensure that SCP-8848 does not develop an addiction to the emotional responses they encounter during their work, which can lead to a dangerous cycle of dependency.
