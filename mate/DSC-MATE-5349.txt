Item #: SCP-5349

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5349 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with enhanced air filtration systems. Any visitors must wear level 2 biohazard suits and remain at a safe distance from SCP-5349 at all times. All interactions with SCP-5349 must be supervised by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-5349 may be allowed recreational activities and access to the local news and theater productions, provided that it does not interfere with containment procedures.

Description: SCP-5349 is a humanoid rabbit of indeterminate age standing approximately six feet tall. SCP-5349's eyes are distinctively red clown eyes that cause mild hypnotic effects on anyone who makes direct eye contact. SCP-5349 is often seen wearing a purple cap with green hair, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask. SCP-5349 claims to be a theater manager, but the veracity of this claim is yet to be verified.

SCP-5349 is idealistic and holds strong opinions on social justice issues. It tends to protest or boycott any company, brand, or cause that goes against its personal values, which can lead to humorous situations. SCP-5349 is cooperative but will refuse to provide any personal information, except for surface-level details about its interests in theater and the arts. SCP-5349's origins and the source of its anomalous abilities are unknown.

Addendum: During a routine checkup, a tissue sample collected from SCP-5349 revealed traces of anomalous mutagenic DNA. Further testing is required to investigate its effects. SCP-5349's status is updated to Euclid until further notice.
