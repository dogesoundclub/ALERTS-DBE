Item #: SCP-2493

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2493 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with no contact from outside personnel or unauthorized individuals. All interactions with SCP-2493 must be approved by Level 4 personnel or higher, and must be supervised at all times.

Description: SCP-2493 appears to be a standard firefighter, but with the notable exception that they are a robot. Their eyes are made up of a VR rainbow LED, and they wear a purple cap with a headset. SCP-2493's ears have a jade earring attached to them, and they wear a medical mask over their mouth. They also wear a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-2493 has a dynamic personality. They are highly organized and prefer to plan ahead, but they possess a spontaneous side that can lead to humorous situations. SCP-2493 enjoys surprising their friends with impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit. They are charismatic and personable, with a good sense of humor.

Due to their robotic nature, SCP-2493 is capable of performing tasks beyond that of a normal human. They possess enhanced strength and durability, which makes them well-suited for firefighting duties. However, SCP-2493 is still susceptible to damage from conventional weapons or advanced technology.

Addendum: SCP-2493 was recovered in [REDACTED], following reports of a rogue firefighting robot causing chaos in the streets. Foundation personnel were able to contain SCP-2493 without incident, and all civilians affected by the robot's actions were given Class A amnestics. Further investigation into SCP-2493's origins is ongoing.
