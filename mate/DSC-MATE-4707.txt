Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4707 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The containment cell must be made of reinforced steel and equipped with a specialized ventilation system to accommodate SCP-4707's smoking habit. Personnel are advised not to interact with SCP-4707 unless absolutely necessary.

Description: SCP-4707 appears as a humanoid tiger with vivid red clown eyes and a red cross earring on its ears. It is approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 220 kg. SCP-4707's most notable feature is its ability to transform into a human form resembling a news anchor, in which it spends most of its time.

SCP-4707 has a compulsive need for order and organization, which can manifest in unexpected ways. It may be found alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet, as well as frequently checking and re-checking its appearance before appearing on camera. SCP-4707 is also known to indulge in chain smoking while on air, which has led to the implementation of specialized ventilation systems.

Personnel should exercise extreme caution when interacting with SCP-4707, as its behavior can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. SCP-4707's compulsive need for order and attention to detail may impair its judgment and ability to make rational decisions, which could result in harm to those around it.

Addendum: SCP-4707's abilities have been deemed too valuable to be terminated. As such, efforts are being made to train and contain SCP-4707's compulsion for order and organization, while continuing to utilize its unique abilities in the field of broadcasting.
