Item #: DSC-MATE-7217

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7217 should be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-7217 should be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher. All interactions with DSC-MATE-7217 should be recorded and monitored at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-7217 is a male human with spots on his face and a frightened mouth. He wears nerd glasses and a green cross earring on each ear. He sports a parted pink head with a red victory band on his forehead and a gold chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-7217 exhibits a detail-oriented personality, often obsessing over minute details, sometimes excessively. These compulsive tendencies have resulted in the alphabetizing of his spice rack and color-coding his closet, among other things. DSC-MATE-7217 works as a farmer and is described as meticulous and diligent in his work.

Although DSC-MATE-7217 is a human, his abnormal behavior and attention to detail suggest that he may have been affected by an anomalous object or event. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of DSC-MATE-7217's behavior.

Addendum: Following Incident-7217-1, all personnel should exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-7217. On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-7217 became agitated and began alphabetizing the books in the Site library. Despite protests from staff, DSC-MATE-7217 continued organizing the books, stating that it was necessary to maintain order. This incident resulted in the loss of several important research documents, highlighting the potential risks of DSC-MATE-7217's behavior.
