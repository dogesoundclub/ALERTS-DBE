Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3002 is to be monitored by an undercover agent to ensure that their spontaneous behavior doesn't pose a threat to the public. The agent is to report any unusual activity to the Foundation immediately. DSC-MATE-3002 should be allowed to continue their daily routine without any interference or modification.

Description: DSC-MATE-3002 is a female human with a striking appearance. They are typically seen dressed in business attire and wearing a medical mask, which they claim is for their own personal health concerns. DSC-MATE-3002 has red lips and wears a gold chain as well as gold earrings. They are a real estate agent by trade, known for their exceptional organizational skills and their ability to plan ahead.

DSC-MATE-3002 has a spontaneous side, which they like to indulge in from time to time. This can lead to humorous situations, such as surprising their friends with impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit. DSC-MATE-3002 is well-liked by their colleagues and is known for their ability to get things done efficiently.

However, the Foundation has reason to believe that DSC-MATE-3002's spontaneous behavior may not be entirely harmless. According to intercepted communications, DSC-MATE-3002 has had contact with several known anomalous entities, and their behavior seems to change when these entities are present. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3002's involvement with these anomalies. 

Addendum: Incident Report 3002-01

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-3002 was observed leaving their home carrying a large, black duffel bag. The undercover agent assigned to monitor DSC-MATE-3002 trailed them from a distance. DSC-MATE-3002 entered a seemingly abandoned building on the outskirts of the city. The agent reported hearing what sounded like chanting and the smell of burning incense emanating from the building.

The agent called for backup, and a team was sent to investigate. Upon entering the building, the team discovered an active summoning ritual being conducted by DSC-MATE-3002 and several other individuals. The ritual was disrupted, and all individuals involved were apprehended and taken into Foundation custody.

Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-3002 had been involved in several anomalous activities, including summoning rituals and dealing with anomalous entities in the black market. DSC-MATE-3002's anomalous behavior was deemed a Level 3 threat, and they were reclassified as Euclid. New containment procedures are currently being developed.
