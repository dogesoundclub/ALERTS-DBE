Item #: SCP-1028

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1028 is currently employed as a train driver and is to be monitored closely by Foundation agents. Any erratic behavior is to be reported immediately to the nearest Site Director for further evaluation. SCP-1028 is not to be approached by any unauthorized personnel and is to remain unaware of their containment status.

Description: SCP-1028 is a male human with a unique feature on his mouth, resembling a spot. The subject has replaced his eyes with Virtual Reality Jade LED technology, which allows him to see a digital overlay on his surroundings. SCP-1028 accessorizes his head with a hoodie and wears a red scarf and carries a candy stick at all times.

SCP-1028's personality is noted to be impulsive, often acting on emotions instead of rational thinking. This has led to humorous situations, but also makes SCP-1028 unpredictable and potentially dangerous if not monitored properly.

SCP-1028 has demonstrated an above-average level of skill as a train driver, but it is unknown if this ability is attributed to anomalous qualities or genetics.

Addendum: SCP-1028's behavior has become increasingly erratic, leading to incidents of speeding and reckless driving. Further investigation revealed that SCP-1028 is affected by anomalous influences while driving, causing a loss of control. Containment procedures have since been revised to include additional monitoring and sedation in situations where SCP-1028's driving poses a threat to public safety.
