Item #: 5071

Special Containment Procedures: 5071 is to be monitored under standard humanoid containment protocols. Any unauthorized interaction with the subject is strictly prohibited. The supervision of 5071's beautician profession is to be conducted by undercover agents under the guise of customers.

Description: 5071 is a humanoid male of the human species, with orange stripes adorned on their countenance. The subject's most striking feature is their broad smile, which is always present on their face. The irises of the subject's eyes are composed of multi-colored VR rainbow LEDs. Additionally, the subject has a green cross earring on their left earlobe.

Personality: 5071 is a highly introspective individual, who often gets lost in their own world of imagination. These daydreaming episodes have caused the subject to encounter humorous situations, such as accidentally bumping into obstacles while passing by. It has been shown that the subject may become distant from others during these episodes, and habitual calling or tapping of the subject is required to bring them back to reality.

Notes: 5071's ability to enhance the natural beauty of humans has been observed through the numerous glowing reviews accumulated by the subject's satisfied customers. It is suspected that 5071 is unaware of their exceptional ability, and they conduct their profession solely for the pleasure of it. Further research into 5071's abilities, if any, is still ongoing.
