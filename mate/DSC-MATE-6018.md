Item #: 6018

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6018, henceforth referred to as 'the Delivery Driver', is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents for any signs of anomalous activity. Due to the subject's friendly demeanor, interactions with the public are permitted, but must be monitored to prevent accidental release of classified information. The Delivery Driver is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with appropriate furnishings for a tiger subject.

Description: The Delivery Driver appears as a Siberian tiger with accessorized clothing. The subject's eyes are ski goggles, and the head is covered with a purple cap and headset. The tiger wears a gold chain, a quirky addition that sees to highlight its carefree spirit.

The Delivery Driver is known for its sociable nature and value of connections. However, the subject also possesses a comical side, often engaging in playful banter with others and telling jokes, resulting in amusing situations.

It should be noted that the Delivery Driver has not exhibited any known abilities outside of its physical strength and intellect, making it a safe creature for observation and interaction.

Additional Notes: The Delivery Driver's job as a delivery driver has proven beneficial in providing a cover for the Foundation to keep tabs on the subject. Its mobility is limited to roadways and urban areas, reducing any chance of exposure to rural or suburban communities. Daily check-ups are to be performed to ensure the well-being and security of the Delivery Driver, and a complete psychological evaluation is to be conducted annually.
