Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2323 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with appropriate modifications for a primate subject. SCP-2323's cell must be equipped with books and puzzles to stimulate its analytical and logical nature. SCP-2323 is to be provided with a steady supply of candy sticks to prevent potential agitation.

Description: SCP-2323 appears to be a capuchin monkey wearing a grey hoodie, normal glasses, and a red scarf. SCP-2323 also has a two-color band across its forehead. The origins of SCP-2323 are unknown, but it claimed to have worked as a real estate agent prior to containment.

SCP-2323's personality is highly analytical and appears to enjoy debating with others. SCP-2323 is capable of rationalizing and arguing with logic for a prolonged period. The subject has been noted to become agitated if denied the opportunity to debate.

SCP-2323 has telekinetic capabilities, and its reasoning abilities enhance its ability to manipulate objects from a distance. SCP-2323's abilities increase in strength when engaged in a heated debate, during which it can hurl objects with great force and precision. Consequently, SCP-2323 must be monitored closely to prevent any accidental harm.

Addendum: SCP-2323's abilities have resulted in several containment breaches. Additional security measures must be implemented to prevent incidents of a similar nature in the future. Investigation into SCP-2323's origins is ongoing.
