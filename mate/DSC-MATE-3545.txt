Item #: 3545

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3545 is currently contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19, and is to be provided psychological counseling as needed to maintain mental stability.

Description: SCP-3545 is a humanoid male of the Homo sapiens species, with a distinctive red beanie on their head and a two-color band on their forehead. They also wear a jade earring, as well as a silver chain accessory. SCP-3545's occupation prior to containment was that of a car salesman.

SCP-3545 possesses a deep sense of empathy and emotional sensitivity, often becoming moved to tears or outbursts when they witness pain or suffering in others. They also exhibit a fondness for animals and nature, making a point to attend to any plants or animals within their proximity.

SCP-3545's anomalous abilities include an enhanced level of understanding and communication with other beings, animal or human alike. They also have an inexplicable ability to heal minor wounds and ailments using touch alone.

Although SCP-3545's abilities are not inherently dangerous, they have been deemed too anomalous to be allowed to continue operating in a public environment. SCP-3545's containment is to be prioritized for their own safety, as well as that of the general public.

Addendum 3545-1: Following a psychological evaluation, it has been determined that SCP-3545's anomalous abilities are the direct result of a traumatic event in their childhood. This has resulted in a heightened sense of emotional intelligence and physical sensitivity. Counseling and therapy sessions are recommended to ensure SCP-3545's continued mental and emotional well-being.
