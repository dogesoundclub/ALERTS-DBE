Item #: SCP-4328

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4328 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel interacting with SCP-4328 must wear Level 2 clearance and be screened for susceptibility to SCP-4328's influence. SCP-4328 is to be allowed out of containment for no more than four hours per week for recreational activities. Any instances where SCP-4328 attempts to use its abilities for personal gain must be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-4328 appears to be a human male in his late 30s, with distinctive facial features. SCP-4328 has a spot on his mouth and a constant and unnerving smile. He sports a flashy gold earring on his left ear, and wears normal glasses. SCP-4328's head is shaved except for a large, vibrant Mohawk. A pair of goggles is frequently worn atop SCP-4328's head, and he favors a red scarf as his accessory of choice.

SCP-4328 works as a car salesman, which enables him to interact with a large number of individuals. SCP-4328 is highly charismatic, with a natural talent for connecting with others on a deep level. SCP-4328's ability to create a sense of familiarity and trust in others can lead to situations where individuals open up about their life stories or humorous anecdotes. SCP-4328's charm is highly effective, with subjects feeling an almost magnetic attraction to him.

SCP staff investigations have revealed that SCP-4328's abilities stem from an unexplained psychic trait that allows him to manipulate people's emotions and gain their trust. SCP-4328 appears to use this ability effortlessly and without conscious awareness. SCP-4328 denies doing anything unusual or dishonest, instead suggesting that he just has a "gift of the gab." 

Addendum: SCP-4328 has been found to be highly susceptible to bribery and extortion attempts due to his manipulative nature. Procedures have been established to monitor SCP-4328's outside activities and restrict access to classified information. SCP-4328's abilities will continue to be studied and evaluated for possible use in future SCP operations.
