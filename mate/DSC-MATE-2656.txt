Description: SCP-2656 (formerly known as the "Farmer") was a human male of average height and weight, with a distinctive Mouth Spot located on the upper lip area. The subject was often seen wearing a red beanie and a red scarf, with a normal gas mask covering his face.

Personality-wise, SCP-2656 was ambitious and goal-oriented, often taking on tasks beyond his capabilities. However, his excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking allowed him to successfully complete these tasks. He was a skilled farmer and often worked hard to maintain his crops and livestock.

SCP-2656's anomalous properties were discovered when his crops abruptly stopped growing, despite regular watering and fertilization. Upon further investigation, it was found that SCP-2656 had unknowingly entered into a contract with a group of fae creatures, in exchange for a bountiful harvest. The fae creatures had, instead, sabotaged SCP-2656's farm and rendered his crops infertile.

Foundation agents managed to break the contract and forced the fae creatures to restore SCP-2656's farm to its former state. SCP-2656, in turn, was neutralized and allowed to return to his normal life as a farmer. He remains unaware of the existence of the Foundation or the fae creatures he had unwittingly entered into a contract with.

Addendum: SCP-2656's case serves as a reminder that even mundane individuals can interact with anomalous objects or creatures without realizing it. Vigilance and attention to detail must be exercised at all times.
