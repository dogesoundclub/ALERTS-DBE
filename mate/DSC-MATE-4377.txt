Item #: 4377

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4377 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment quarters at Site-██. Personnel in contact with 4377 must possess Level 2 clearance and have undergone psychological screening to ensure they can handle 4377's unique personality traits. Any requests for organizational materials or tools must be approved on a case-by-case basis by Dr. █████.

Description: 4377 is a human male with unremarkable physical characteristics except for the presence of orange stripes on his face, a two-color band on his forehead, and a gold earring on each ear. They also wear a silver chain as an accessory. Subject 4377 is employed as a mechanic, but they exhibit a compulsion to organize and arrange items in their environment in a meticulous manner. 

4377's personality is detail-oriented and obsessive, going to great lengths to organize and order every aspect of their life. This trait sometimes manifests in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing their spice rack, color-coding their closet, or obsessively checking all the bolts on a vehicle they are repairing. Despite these quirks, 4377 is cooperative and polite to those they interact with, but they can become irritable if their carefully ordered stacks or labeled containers are disturbed.

No anomalous abilities or properties have been detected in subject 4377, and they appear to perform well in their job as a mechanic. However, their obsessive-compulsive tendencies could pose a risk to operational security or sabotage resource allocation. Continued observation and psychological assessment are necessary to ensure the subject's suitability for continued employment and containment.
