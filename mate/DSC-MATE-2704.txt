Item #: 2704

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2704 is to be kept under surveillance whilst being allowed to continue with their occupation as a journalist for The News Press. Any articles authored by 2704 are to be scrutinized and reviewed by a designated team before publication. In the event that 2704 becomes unmanageable, extreme measures must be taken to prevent the spread of sensitive information or harm to civilians.

Description: Subject 2704, a male Siberian tiger of approximate 8.5ft in height and weighing around 300 lbs. Its eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, and on the forehead is a goggle that reads and analyzes information he encounters.  It has a distinctive jade earring on its left ear. The creature is seldom seen without its silver chain, connected to a candy stick. Most interestingly, the tiger has developed a sense of logic and reasoning much akin to the higher-order thinking of the humanoid species.

Personality:  Despite the obvious risks of allowing this entity to blend in with society, its sharp wit and inquisitive nature make it an intriguing individual to speak with. Often engaging in debates and arguments, about topics most would consider trivial, its analytical thinking process, and an almost irritating attention to detail are indeed memorable. However, it is recommended to deny any challenge of authority from the creature, as it has shown a propensity to escalate conflicts physically if it feels its superiority is being ignored or disrespected.

Addendum: 2704 is actively seen feeding on candy sticks, which may explain its docile behavior. The candy contains a psychotropic compound that causes a pliable and agreeable demeanor to the subject. The composition of the confectionary is yet to be analyzed. Further investigation into its food habits is highly encouraged.
