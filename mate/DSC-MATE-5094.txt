Item #: SCP-5094

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5094 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a remotely operated door and ceiling-mounted sprinkler system capable of discharging fire-retardant foam in the event of an uncontrolled fire. No combustible materials or accelerants are to be allowed within the chamber, and SCP-5094 is to be monitored at all times via closed-circuit television.

SCP-5094 is to be allowed access to a standardized set of amenities, including a folding chair, a desk with writing materials, and a Bluetooth-enabled speaker system for listening to music, podcasts, or other non-dangerous aural stimuli. Food and water are to be provided via an automated delivery system, and waste is to be removed via a similarly automated sewage system.

SCP-5094 is to be scheduled for weekly interviews with Foundation personnel to monitor its mental state and overall well-being. Due to its highly social and interactive personality, it is recommended that personnel conducting interviews are trained in basic improvisational comedy, joke-telling, and other forms of humor to better engage with SCP-5094 and maintain its cooperative attitude.

Description: SCP-5094 is a humanoid male of indeterminate age or origin, approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 70 kilograms. Its facial features include a distinctive pattern of brown spots on its face and neck, as well as bright blue irises reminiscent of clown makeup.

SCP-5094 exhibits a highly outgoing and sociable personality, frequently engaging in verbal banter, wordplay, and light-hearted humor with both Foundation personnel and non-anomalous individuals. It is adept at telling jokes, performing silly impressions, and finding amusing angles on mundane situations.

However, SCP-5094 also demonstrates a latent pyrokinetic ability, leading to several incidents in which it accidentally or intentionally ignited nearby objects, including paper, fabric, and wooden furniture. This ability appears to be triggered by stress or emotional volatility and is currently being studied by Foundation scientists.

SCP-5094's mundane identity is that of a banker, and it claims to have no knowledge of its anomalous properties or origin. It has displayed a general reluctance to discuss its past, though it has hinted at a troubled childhood and adolescence, and a proclivity towards practical jokes and macabre humor.

Dr. Singh: Good morning, 5094. How are you feeling today?

SCP-5094: Oh, hey there, Doc! I'm feeling as good as a banker can these days. Ha!

Dr. Singh: (chuckles) I see you're still in high spirits. That's good to see. Have you noticed any changes since we last spoke?

SCP-5094: Well, I've been practicing my magic tricks a bit more. Wanna see one?

Dr. Singh: (smiling) Sure, go ahead.

SCP-5094 proceeds to produce a lit cigarette from behind Dr. Singh's ear, eliciting a surprised yelp from her.

Dr. Singh: (laughing) That's very impressive, 5094. But please refrain from lighting anything else on fire, alright?

SCP-5094: (sighs) Yeah, yeah, I know. No more pyro stuff. But I gotta keep myself entertained somehow, you know?

Dr. Singh: I understand. But we need to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you. That's why we're here.

SCP-5094: (smiling) Hey, don't worry about me, Doc. I'm feeling the love already.
