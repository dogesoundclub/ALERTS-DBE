DSC-MATE-34, designated as "The Spotted Lawyer," is a humanoid creature that resembles a human female. Its most noticeable features are the spots on its face, which seem to be permanent and cover both its cheeks. Additionally, its lips have been observed to be a deep shade of purple, although it is unclear if this is a result of makeup or a natural feature.

The lawyer is often seen wearing an 00s school girl outfit, complete with a red cross earring and a gold chain. Its most striking feature is its eyes, which appear to be VR Jade LED, giving it an otherworldly gaze.

 DSC-MATE-34 has a unique personality, known for being unpredictable and impulsive at times. It often takes risks without much thought, leading it to engage in dangerous activities without apparent concern for its own safety. When interviewed, it revealed that it enjoys the adrenaline and excitement of these risks and often "lives in the moment." 

To date, DSC-MATE-34 has not exhibited any supernatural abilities or traits beyond its unusual appearance and personality. However, researchers speculate that there may be some underlying paranormal cause for its unpredictable behavior. Further study is needed to determine the extent of its abilities and any potential risks it may pose.
