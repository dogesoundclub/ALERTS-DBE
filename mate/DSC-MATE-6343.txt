SCP-6343, also known as "Hopscotch," is a male rabbit with an artistic and creative personality. Although his physical appearance is that of a typical rabbit, with fluffy white fur and large ears, he is often seen sporting a purple cap with a headset and a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-6343's most notable feature is his LED gas mask, which he wears at all times. However, it is unclear whether the mask serves any practical purpose, or if it is simply a fashion statement.

As a real estate agent, SCP-6343 uses his natural charm and persuasive personality to close deals and make profitable transactions. However, it is important to note that he does not always play by the rules, and may employ less-than-ethical tactics to achieve his goals.

Despite his sometimes-questionable business practices, SCP-6343 remains a popular figure in the local art scene. He enjoys painting, drawing, and writing, and is often seen attending art shows and gallery openings.

It is unclear whether SCP-6343 possesses any anomalous properties, but caution is advised when dealing with him. He has been known to engage in questionable activities and may have connections to other anomalous entities. As always, any information regarding SCP-6343 should be reported immediately to the Foundation.
