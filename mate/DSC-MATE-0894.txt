SCP Foundation Containment Report: SCP-894

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-894 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. It is to be provided with a personal grooming kit and access to beauty and hair products. Access to sharp objects is strictly prohibited. Any requests for additional beauty items or equipment must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-894 is a male rabbit of average size and weight. Its appearance is unremarkable, but it displays a permanent frightened mouth expression. SCP-894 wears a hoodie on its head and horned rim glasses that give it a scholarly appeal. It also sports a LED gas mask that alters its voice.

SCP-894's primary occupation is as a beautician, and it possesses exceptional skills in this field. Its talent is so exceptional that it can understand the needs of its clients before they even articulate them. SCP-894 takes immense pride in its work and will do whatever it takes to ensure that its clients are pleased with its services.

SCP-894 has a laid-back and easy-going personality, making it a popular member among the Foundation staff. However, it can also be incredibly loyal and protective of its friends and family. It has been known to become agitated and argumentative when someone insults or attacks them. These situations often have humorous outcomes, leading to SCP-894's nickname of "the bunny bodyguard" among Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-894's personality can be unstable at times, displaying extreme hyperactivity and sporadic fits of rage. Such episodes usually occur when SCP-894 is unable to perform its duties as a beautician. In such cases, it must be isolated and reminded of its importance to the Foundation.
