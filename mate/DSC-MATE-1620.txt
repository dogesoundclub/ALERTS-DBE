SCP-1620, codenamed "The Hare of Humor", is a mysterious villainous rabbit of unknown origin. His appearance is highly distinctive, with normal glasses that conceal his eyes from view at all times. On SCP-1620's forehead is a pair of goggles, which he wears as if it is an everyday accessory. Researchers have yet to determine if the goggles serve any practical purpose or if they are merely a fashion statement on the part of SCP-1620.

SCP-1620's green fur is noticeably unkempt, as if it has not been properly taken care of for quite some time. However, an aspect of SCP-1620's appearance that draws attention is the gold earring he wears on his left ear, whom he cherishes a lot.  

SCP-1620's personality is highly outgoing and social, which can make it easy to underestimate him as just another goofy rabbit. He loves being the center of attention, making it a habit of telling humorous stories, and jokes that are so funny that even though people initially associate him with hapless humor, SCP-1620 has the ability to turn the tides against his opponents. 

Despite his mischievous nature, SCP-1620 is a highly dangerous and unpredictable foe. Physically, he is capable of jumping to exceptional heights and moving at lightning-fast speeds, making it difficult for anyone to track him down once he has made up his mind to strike. It is essential that all Foundation personnel remain on alert when within proximity to SCP-1620 to avoid becoming the unwitting victims of his cunning traps and mischievous pranks.
