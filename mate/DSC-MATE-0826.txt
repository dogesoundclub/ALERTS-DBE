SCP-826 is a seasoned police officer, stationed in the bustling city of New York. He may appear average at first glance, with his human appearance and physical features. However, it is his unique accessories that make SCP-826 stand out in a crowd. Adorned with a bucket hat, 2-color band across his forehead, and a green cross earring on each ear, SCP-826 exudes a quirky and unconventional vibe. 

SCP-826 is a bit of a scatterbrain, tapping into his absent-mindedness at every possible turn. His thoughts often drift off into a world of their own, leading him to forgetful moments that can cause chaos and comedic situations. He is prone to losing track of time, neglecting important duties, and overlooking scheduled appointments, which can lead to disastrous consequences. To avoid these mishaps, SCP-826 can often be seen sporting a medical mask, shielding him from the outside world and allowing him to focus on his tasks. 

Although SCP-826's heedlessness can be a bit of a challenge for those around him, his unique perspective and unconventional approach to policing have proven to be assets in his line of duty. The SCP Foundation continues to watch over SCP-826's every move, ensuring his antics do not impede his job as a police officer.
