SCP-2135, also known as the "Dreaming Farmer", is a humanoid entity of the Homo sapiens species. Her physical appearance is characterized by orange stripes on her face, an orange side head, and jade earrings on her ears. However, the most remarkable feature is her VR Rainbow LED eyes, which emit a bright light and can display multiple colors and patterns.

SCP-2135 works as a farmer, but her behavior tends to be eccentric and unpredictable. She often spends long periods lost in thought or daydreaming, leading to a disconnection from her surroundings. The entity wears a medical mask that hides her mouth, making it difficult to interpret her emotional state.

SCP-2135's most notable characteristic is her introspective and imaginative nature. The entity can envision complex scenarios and stories, which can be both a blessing and a curse. In many cases, it results in humorous situations, such as tripping over objects while immersed in her thoughts.

Due to SCP-2135's unique abilities and behavior patterns, containment protocols have been established. The entity is to be kept in an isolated chamber with no access to technology or stimuli that could trigger her vivid imagination.

SCP-2135 is a fascinating example of the unpredictable nature of the human mind in an urban fantasy setting. Her abilities and eccentricities make the entity a valuable asset to scientific research, but also a significant security risk to the general public.
