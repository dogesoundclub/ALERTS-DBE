SCP Foundation Description

Item #: SCP-6904

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6904 is to be kept under standard humanoid confinement protocols, in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to any form of media within the cell is prohibited.

Description: SCP-6904 is a female human of average build and height, with a preference for a hooded clothing style. SCP-6904 is identified by a distinct feature of bright red lipstick, as well as the silver chain accessory she tends to wear around her neck. SCP-6904 is a reporter and has been known to have a distinct fascination with thrill-seeking activities and experiences.

Under observation, it has been noted that SCP-6904 often takes unnecessary risks and adventures, such as bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. Despite these inclinations, SCP-6904 has yet to show any evidence of actual psychological disorder or compulsive behaviors.

SCP-6904 has expressed her inherent love for adventure and novelty, enjoying new experiences and pushing the boundaries of her comfort zone. Despite her tendency towards self-endangerment, SCP-6904 is cooperative and compliant when within Foundation custody. 

SCP-6904 is known to have a disarming charm and friendliness, which can be both beneficial and potentially problematic when gathering intelligence as a reporter. It is recommended that Foundation personnel keep communication with SCP-6904 to a minimum to avoid establishing any undue emotional attachments.

Addendum: Due to SCP-6904's status as a celebrity within certain social circles, any news of her containment or confinement must be strictly controlled to prevent public exposure of the Foundation's existence. Any potential breach of this information must be dealt with immediately and with maximum precautions.
