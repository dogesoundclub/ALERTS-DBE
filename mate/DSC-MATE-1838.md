Item #: 1838

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1838, also known as "The Doctor," is to be kept on-site at all times in a secure containment chamber. All access to the chamber is to be granted solely by authorized personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. The Doctor must undergo weekly psychological evaluations to ensure mental stability.

Description: The Doctor appears to be a typical human male, with the exception of the peculiar features on his face. His frightened expression and ski goggle eyes create a disconcerting appearance. The Doctor is commonly seen wearing a retro cap and a jade earring in his left ear, with a gold chain and cigarette as accessories.

Personality: The Doctor has a tendency to become absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time and missing important events. This may be attributed to his passionate and intense work ethic that results in his mind being constantly occupied with projects and thoughts. Despite this, The Doctor's sense of humor and kind nature provide a sense of comfort to those around him.

Note: It is strongly advised that no physical contact be made with The Doctor, as it has been reported to result in permanent memory loss.
