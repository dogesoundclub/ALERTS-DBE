SCP-8888 works as a reporter and has submitted a number of articles to various publications related to urban fantasy and supernatural phenomena.

Addendum:

SCP-8888 is currently under Foundation observation following concerns about their connection to a series of incidents involving SCP-███ - a creature known to cause severe emotional and psychological distress in affected individuals. Initial testing indicates that SCP-8888 may be immune to the effects of SCP-███, although further testing is ongoing.
