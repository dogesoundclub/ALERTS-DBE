Item #: SCP-9696

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9696 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Due to its profession as a veterinarian, SCP-9696 is allowed access to certain animals for care, provided there is proper supervision. In the case of a containment breach, personnel are advised to avoid direct eye contact with SCP-9696.

Description: SCP-9696 is a human female with spots on their face and a permanent smile. Their eyes are red, resembling those of a clown, and they have blonde hair with a wing-shaped design on their head. SCP-9696 wears a single green cross earring and a silver chain. They are commonly seen wearing a gas mask, though it does not appear to be a necessary accessory for their survival.

SCP-9696 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, leading them to take on more tasks than they can handle. This often results in humorous situations, such as attempting to carry too many items or failing to complete all their work for the day. Despite this, SCP-9696 remains professional during their duties as a veterinarian.

SCP-9696 has displayed the ability to manipulate the emotions of those around them, causing them to feel an overwhelming sense of joy or amusement. This effect appears to be involuntary, as SCP-9696 has expressed confusion and frustration regarding their inability to control it.

Addendum: Following Incident 9696-1, SCP-9696 has been placed on a low-risk duty roster, with limited access to sensitive information or hazardous creatures. All personnel assigned to SCP-9696 should remain cautious and avoid prolonged eye contact.
