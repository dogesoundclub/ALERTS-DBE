Description: 2213 is a male human of average height and build, with distinct spots on his face and a perpetually frightened expression. His eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and his forehead features a two-color band and a goggle that he frequently wears. He also sports a green cross earring, a red scarf and often carries a candy stick.

Subject 2213 is in possession of a deep curiosity about the world, and is often found randomly reading or researching obscure or unusual topics. He also has a habit of spouting off random facts and trivia to others, which can lead to some humorous and unexpected situations. Despite his seemingly harmless nature, he has been classified as a villain due to his propensity for using his knowledge for less than noble purposes.
