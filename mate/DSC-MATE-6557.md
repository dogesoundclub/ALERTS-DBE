ANOMALOUS ITEM REPORT

Identification number: 6557

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6557 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-19, with all communication channels under strict monitoring. No interaction with the subject is allowed outside of authorized testing procedures.

Description: DSC-MATE-6557 is a human male, believed to be in his late thirties, and of Italian-American descent. They are the leader of one of the most prominent mafia families in the northeastern United States, with close ties to organized crime at a global level.

DSC-MATE-6557's most distinguishing feature is their green hair, which they keep styled with a purple cap. They often accessorize their outfit with a red victory band on their forehead, gold earring in their left ear, and a gold chain around their neck.

They have a natural talent for leadership and often find themselves taking charge of situations, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in their personal life. DSC-MATE-6557 exhibits signs of anxiety and paranoia, constantly looking over their shoulder and twitching their frightened mouth. They typically wear nerd glasses to further obscure their identity.

DSC-MATE-6557's anomalous properties manifest primarily in their charismatic leadership skills. It is unclear whether this is an inherent trait or the result of an external effect. However, they have a strong influence over their family's members and anyone who owes them allegiance, as well as some limited control over individuals with no prior connection to them.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6557 has made it clear that they will not cooperate with Foundation agents or reveal any information about their organization. This makes it essential that we keep them under our supervision, lest they become a security threat.
