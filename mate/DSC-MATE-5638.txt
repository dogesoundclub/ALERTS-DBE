Item #: SCP-5638

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5638 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. All personnel are to avoid being emotionally vulnerable around SCP-5638, as her empathetic abilities are known to have a strong influence on those around her. Access to SCP-5638 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-5638 is a humanoid female identified as a banker. Her physical appearance is notable for orange stripes on her cheeks, purple lips, VR Rainbow LED eyes, pig tails on her head, and red cross earrings on her ears. She often wears a choker and is frequently observed smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5638's empathetic and compassionate nature makes her a valuable asset in the containment of anomalous entities with strong emotional components. However, her tendency to take on the problems of others as her own can lead to emotional exhaustion and mental instability. She is therefore closely monitored by Site-19 personnel.

Addendum: Despite the potential for emotional instability, SCP-5638 has proven to be an effective asset to the SCP Foundation. Her skills in financial management have been used to fund multiple containment efforts and special projects. SCP-5638 is reminded to keep her emotional boundaries intact for her own safety, as well as the safety of others.
