Item #: SCP-5775

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5775 is to be given standard living quarters in Site-██ and is allowed to perform her duties as a traffic officer in the Foundation-controlled city of ██████. Due to SCP-5775's stubbornness, any change in her routine must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any emotional distress encountered by SCP-5775 is to be reported to the site psychiatrist immediately.

Description: SCP-5775 is a female human traffic officer with spots on her face and a permanent smile. SCP-5775 has normal vision and wears standard prescription glasses. SCP-5775 has light brown hair styled in a 90s fashion, and one small gold earring in each ear. SCP-5775 is frequently seen smoking a cigarette while on duty.

SCP-5775's greatest asset is her reliability and organization, often making her an exemplary traffic officer. However, SCP-5775's stubbornness and resistance to change can cause unexpected situations and interference with Foundation operations. SCP-5775 has been known to become emotionally distressed when she is forced to break from her usual routine.

SCP-5775 frequently gives nicknames to the cars she tickets and to the people she encounters while performing her duties. These nicknames are personal and unique to SCP-5775.

Addendum: SCP-5775 has expressed several times that she believes she is not part of the Foundation and that she is not being observed. SCP-5775's belief may be due to a psychological condition or an anomalous effect. Further study is required.
