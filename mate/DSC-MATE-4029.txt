Item #: 4029

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4029, also known as "The Real Estate Agent," is to be kept under 24/7 surveillance by no less than two armed security personnel at all times. She must be prohibited from making any unauthorized contact with the outside world, including but not limited to the internet, phone, or mail. Any breach of these containment procedures must be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: Subject 4029 is a human female with bright orange stripes on her face feature #1, and distinguishing red clown eyes. Her head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, and she wears a gas mask as part of her accessory #1. Her jade earrings and two-color band on her forehead feature #1 help in her identification. Despite her appearance, subject 4029 has been listed as a human species.

Subject 4029 is a real estate agent by profession, but her personality is rebellious and constantly pushing the limits. She finds immense pleasure in creating situations that involve breaking rules or bending them to see what happens. Her humor and unapologetic nature make it difficult for her to follow the dynamic set by law and morals.

Due to her extraordinary behavior, subject 4029 often attracts the attention of other supernatural entities and has been involved with multiple security breaches, resulting in excessive collateral damage to both humans and other entities. Her life history and connections are considered high-priority targets for any hostile entities who intend to disrupt the standard norm of human- and entity-mediated coexistence. 

Addendum: Further research is required to determine if SCP Containment is necessary for subject 4029, and if so, the best way to ensure its effective containment.
