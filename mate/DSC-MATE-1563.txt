SCP-1563 is a human male, serving as a police officer in a metropolitan area. His physical appearance is rather unremarkable, with normal blonde hair and a medical mask covering his mouth. However, his eyes are a highly unusual feature - they appear to be composed of a series of VR rainbow LED lights, giving him a distinctly artificial and otherworldly appearance.

SCP-1563's personality is equally unique, marked by a strong analytical and logical nature. He enjoys debating with others, even on trivial topics, and has been known to engage in heated arguments for the sheer enjoyment of it. Though this often results in humorous situations, it is unclear what his true motivations are.

In addition to his unusual eyes and argumentative nature, SCP-1563 is often seen wearing a red scarf and a jade earring. It is unknown if these accessories hold any further significance or contain anomalous properties.

Overall, SCP-1563's curious blend of human and non-human traits make him a fascinating subject for study and a valuable asset to the police force - though caution is advised when engaging in debate with him.
