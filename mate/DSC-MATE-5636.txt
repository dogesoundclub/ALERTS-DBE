Item #: SCP-5636

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5636 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with basic amenities such as a bed, a bathroom, and a recreational area. Any communication with SCP-5636 is to be monitored and restricted to authorized personnel only. SCP-5636 is to be provided with standard police officer gear and attires, while any electronic device that is not approved for use by SCP Foundation is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-5636 is a Human female in her early 30s, standing at approximately 170 cm and weighing around 60 kg. They have a cheerful personality and often displays a light-hearted demeanor. SCP-5636 shows exceptional proficiency in law enforcement, hence recruited to the police force initially. However, they display a tendency to forget things, lose track of time, and easily get sidetracked, mostly when not involved in their daily activities. 

SCP-5636's most prominent feature is their VR Rainbow LED eyes, which overshadow all other features upon first glance. It also constantly emits a distinctive glow that intensifies and flickers, indicating fluctuations in SCP-5636's mental and emotional state. When under high-stress scenarios, the LED lights emit alarming frequency, which induces significant migraines, posing a risk to anyone within the immediate vicinity. 

SCP-5636 prefers to wear a black "hoodie" with the hood always covering their head, making casual interaction and body language reading difficult. They would periodically light up and smoke a cigarette, which further exacerbates their unpredictable behavior.

Despite these peculiarities, SCP-5636 has consistently shown excellent police work and has been commended on numerous occasions for their efficient teamwork and instinctive decision-making.

Addendum: SCP-5636's unpredictable behavior is currently under investigational analysis. It is suspected that there may be anomalous properties linked to SCP-5636's LED eyes and the hoodie, which may require further scrutiny.
