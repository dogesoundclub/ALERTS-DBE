DSC-MATE-4438 possesses a strong sense of intuition, which has been described as precognitive in nature.

Addendum: Since its containment, DSC-MATE-4438 has shown a reluctance to use its abilities, often stating that it is "better not to know". However, DSC-MATE-4438 has requested access to the Foundation's database to aid in its legal work. This request is currently under review.
