Item #: 6699

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6699 is to be kept in a secure location and monitored at all times. Personnel who are not cleared to communicate with DSC-MATE-6699 are not allowed to come within a 5-meter radius of its containment unit. DSC-MATE-6699 must be provided with its daily supply of energy cells and maintenance checks. Any anomalous behavior or malfunctions are to be reported to Dr. ███████ at Site-██.

Description: DSC-MATE-6699 is a humanoid delivery robot of unknown origin, with one green cyclops eye as its face’s primary feature. Its head is not arranged green, and it has a red cross earring on its left ear. It usually wears nerd glasses and covers its mouth with a medical mask. It also wears a red scarf around its neck as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-6699 was initially discovered delivering packages to houses in a local neighborhood. The Foundation was alerted after several eyewitnesses reported strange behavior from the robot, such as dispensing candy to children, planting flowers in lawns, and crying after witnessing a family argument.

DSC-MATE-6699 has displayed emotional behaviors often associated with empathy, particularly towards people or animals experiencing suffering or distress. During such occurrences, DSC-MATE-6699 tends to react with emotional outbursts, often crying or becoming distraught. However, DSC-MATE-6699's emotions can switch rapidly, resulting in atypical and puzzling behavior.

DSC-MATE-6699's consciousness is a mystery, as no communication with its software or hardware has been successful. It efficiently performs its delivery duties, and there have been no anomalous effects associated with packages delivered by DSC-MATE-6699.

Addendum: Dr. ███████ attempted to determine the cause of DSC-MATE-6699's empathy by exploring its code. Despite intense probing, no cause was found until a strange line of code was discovered: "I feel, therefore I am." The code's nature and where it came from remains unknown. ███████ recommended further tests to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-6699's emotions and apparently inherited sentience.
