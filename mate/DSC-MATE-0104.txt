SCP-104 is a Real Estate Agent of unknown origin. The subject appears to be fully human, however, anomalous traits have been detected upon close observation. SCP-104's most distinguishing feature is their set of Ski Goggle eyes, seemingly made of glass or some other transparent material, that emit a faint blue aura. SCP-104's head is made of a metallic purple material, composed of an unknown element, with a spherical shape that resembles a helmet. A functional goggle is kept on their forehead, hanging off a black leather band.

SCP-104's ears are adorned with a golden earring, that appears to be of ancient design. Two accessories are constantly looped around the subject's neck - a silver chain, and a candy stick. Upon detection, the candy stick was found to be non-anomalous, however, SCP-104 displays a significant attachment to it.

SCP-104 exhibits overwhelming maternal instincts and a nurturing personality, which has led to their involvement in several humorous situations. The subject displays a particular fondness for children and often treats their close friends and family members as if they were their own offspring. It has been noted that SCP-104 becomes extremely irritable when separated from their loved ones for extended periods, leading to displays of distressed behavior.

Agents are advised to approach SCP-104 with caution as their anomalous properties could potentially put the Agents at risk. All interactions with SCP-104 should be documented and any further anomalous activity must be reported immediately to the Foundation.
