Item #: 2502

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2502 is to be contained within a designated news station studio and prohibited from autonomous broadcasting. SCP-2502's transmissions undergo mandatory screening prior to release to the general public. Any anomalies or oddities in transmission shall be reported immediately to the assigned Director of Urban Fantasy Division.

Description: SCP-2502 is a human female news anchor with orange stripes on her face, pig tails for hair, and red cross earrings. Despite her unusual appearance, SCP-2502 appears to possess a charismatic persona that attracts a wide viewership demographic. SCP-2502 has an inherent drive for knowledge and can often be found engrossed in books, research or documentaries. SCP-2502 is also fiercely passionate about sharing her newfound knowledge with the public and using it to enrich the populace. 

SCP-2502's broadcasts are noted to often incorporate obscure topics or urban legends, seemingly unrelated to the standard news media. However, a higher frequency of recent events occurring within the limitations of SCP-2502's broadcasts have been observed. 

SCP-2502 displays no anomalous activity except for her unorthodox presentation and irregular news content. SCP-2502's transmissions have been proven safe regarding the Foundation's security, and are allowed to continue at this time.

Addendum: Recent events leads Urban Fantasy Division to conclude the possibility of SCP-2502 being able to manifest the anomalous creatures or objects from the urban legends she reports. It is suggested that further research be conducted on SCP-2502's capability and ability to manifest supernatural events.
