Item #: 6854

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6854 is to be kept in its designated office at Site-███ with access to standard medical equipment. It is to be allowed free access to any medical records and procedures it may require for its work as a medical doctor.

Description: SCP-6854 is a female human with an age estimated to be between 30 and 40 years old, with a height of 1.65m and a weight of 55kg. Notably, SCP-6854 has spots on its face and always wears a smile. It is also identified by its unique orange eyebrow and a vintage retro cap. It has a gas mask with blue LED lights attached to it and wears goggles over its forehead. Two black bands, colored red and blue, are attached to its forehead.

SCP-6854 is a medical doctor with exceptional surgical skills and is known to be methodical, analytical and logical. It shows an exceptional ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases, especially within the field of internal medicine. Despite its serious demeanor, it also displays an eccentric sense of humor and enjoys teasing its colleagues with deadpan comments.

SCP-6854 has been known to use its medical training and knowledge in unexpected ways, particularly in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology. Its work includes "unique" medications, some of which are not approved by conventional medical institutions.

Addendum 1: Interview with SCP-6854

Dr. ██████: Can you explain why you wear a gas mask with LED lights?

SCP-6854: They are to remind me to stay alert and focused on my work, and also because they look cool, don't you think?

Dr. ██████: Can you tell us about your diagnostic and surgical techniques? They seem to be beyond what is typically taught in medical school.

SCP-6854: My techniques are a product of my experience, and sometimes a product of my invention. I believe that medicine is an art as well as a science. And like any artist, I'm not afraid to take risks.

Dr. ██████: Risks?

SCP-6854: Sometimes the risks are worth it. And anyway, experimentation is the key to progress, in medicine and life.

Dr. ██████: Understood. Thank you for your time, SCP-6854. 

Addendum 2: Incident Report. On ██/██/20██, SCP-6854's office was found to have a number of experimental medicines that had not been approved by any known medical institution. One medicine was found to have unusual side effects, causing a researcher to grow an extra pair of arms. Agent ███████, in response, ordered a thorough investigation of SCP-6854's practices, but it was decided that its expertise outweighed the potential risks that its experimentation posed.  However, additional monitoring of SCP-6854's work is currently under consideration.
