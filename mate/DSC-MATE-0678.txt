Item #: SCP-678

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-678 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell located within Site-██. Due to SCP-678's profession as a beautician, they are allowed access to a limited supply of beauty products for personal use but must not come into contact with any other individuals unless authorized by Level 3 personnel. Any instances of SCP-678's goofy behavior must be monitored and reported to supervising staff to prevent the risk of breach.

Description: SCP-678 is a human male commonly referred to as "The Clown Beautician" by Foundation personnel. SCP-678 possesses facial features that resemble those of a clown, including red eyes, a mouth spot, and a clown mouth. SCP-678 is typically seen wearing a short peak cap and a red scarf, as well as a green cross earring on each ear.

SCP-678's behavior is generally friendly and outgoing, with a focus on maintaining social connections and promoting harmony. However, SCP-678 also exhibits playful and goofy tendencies, often engaging in jokes and banter with others. These tendencies have led to numerous comedic situations, but they also present a risk for Foundation security if not monitored closely.

SCP-678's anomalous ability is the ability to manipulate beauty products with varying effects. SCP-678 can alter the composition of cosmetics, perfumes, and other beauty products to produce various effects, including changes in skin tone, hair texture, and even changes in bodily features. This ability is scaleable and can be used to inflict harm on individuals if left unchecked.

Addendum: Following Incident-678-A, in which SCP-678 accidentally caused a containment breach while attempting to style Site-██'s security officer's hair, all instances of SCP-678's ability to manipulate beauty products have been heavily restricted. Any requests for access to beauty products must be approved by Level 3 personnel and monitored closely.
