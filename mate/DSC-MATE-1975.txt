Item #: SCP-1975

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1975 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All communication with SCP-1975 is to be conducted through a designated intermediary. Due to SCP-1975's tendency to anthropomorphize objects, all personal items and belongings are to be screened and approved prior to being granted to SCP-1975.

Description: SCP-1975 is a human female, approximately 32 years of age. Physical traits of note include short black hair, glasses, and a red cross earring on their left ear. SCP-1975 is often seen wearing a black choker.

SCP-1975 is highly empathetic and nurturing, extending these traits to both living beings and inanimate objects. They have been observed to assign names to their personal belongings, such as their car, and spoken to their houseplants as if they had sentience. SCP-1975's anomalous ability appears to stem from their strong emotions, and they have shown signs of depression and anxiety when their caretaking behavior is suppressed.

When a personal object is separated from SCP-1975, they will exhibit signs of distress, similar to that of misplacing a cherished item. SCP-1975 has also demonstrated the ability to temporarily imbue their belongings with emotion, causing them to move on their own or display behavior outside of their typical function. Reports of this phenomenon typically involve houseplants dying or becoming overgrown within a short period of SCP-1975's departure.

Addendum: SCP-1975 was initially brought to the Foundation's attention after they were reported to the police for trespassing on a property to tend to a neglected lawn. Foundation agents were dispatched to detain SCP-1975 for questioning, upon which SCP-1975 displayed anomalous behavior. After investigation and containment, SCP-1975 was classified as an anomalous humanoid and transferred to Site-██.
