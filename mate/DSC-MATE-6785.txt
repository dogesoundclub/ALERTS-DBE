Item #: 6785

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6785, also known as the "Tiger Agent," is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced steel walls and a titanium door. The chamber should be equipped with at least three hidden cameras, infrared sensors, and a white noise generator to avoid any possible territorial aggression from the subject.

Subject 6785's meals are to consist of raw meat, and should be inspected thoroughly for any possible herb replacement. Caretakers should wear protective suits and maintain a safe distance when providing meals or performing maintenance in the containment chamber.

Security personnel should be informed that the whistle that subject 6785 carries can result in disorientation and confusion to those within hearing range. Extreme caution is advised during transportation and in emergency situations where subject 6785 is offsite.

Description: Subject 6785 appears as a male tiger with jade LED eyes and a police cap on its head. It sports a gold earring on one ear and a red scarf around its neck. Its most striking feature is a perpetually frightened mouth, presenting an appearance of anxiety and vulnerability.

Subject 6785 possesses an outgoing and social personality, displaying a tendency to be the center of attention. Its humorous and lighthearted nature often results in inexplicable joy and laughter in those around it. However, this behavior can also negatively affect containment protocols and must be monitored by Security personnel.

Addendum: Subject 6785's previous career as a Real Estate Agent provides insight into its ability to persuade others into making deals benefiting the subject. The SCP Foundation may utilize subject 6785's abilities in cases of negotiation or diplomacy under strict supervision to prevent any misuse.
