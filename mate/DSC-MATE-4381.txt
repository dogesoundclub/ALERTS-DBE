Item #: SCP-4381

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4381 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-4381's medical mask is to be kept on at all times, except in the case of medical examination or testing. Any attempts by SCP-4381 to remove or damage the mask are to be immediately reported and reprimanded.

Description: SCP-4381 is a human female identified as a fashion designer by profession. SCP-4381 is approximately 28 years old and stands at 1.75 meters in height. SCP-4381 features a short, witch-like hairstyle, a red lip, and a green cross earring. SCP-4381 also wears a leather choker at all times. SCP-4381 is known for having a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but is fiercely protective and loyal to her loved ones.

SCP-4381 is known to exhibit anomalous properties when under stress or intense emotions. SCP-4381 has been observed to emit a low-level psychic energy, causing hallucinations and sensory disturbances in nearby individuals. SCP-4381 has also displayed acute awareness of danger and an ability to defend herself with rapid reflexes and agility.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-4381 was involved in a containment breach in which she demonstrated a significant increase in physical strength and energy output. SCP-4381 identified herself as "The Witch Queen" and attempted to resist containment. Following an intense stand-off, SCP-4381 was subdued and all personnel involved with the incident have undergone mandatory psychological evaluations.

There is ongoing research into the possibility of a connection between SCP-4381's anomalous properties and her profession as a fashion designer. Investigations are ongoing.
