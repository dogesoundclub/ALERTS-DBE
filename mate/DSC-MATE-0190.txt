SCP-190: The Tearful Politician

Description: SCP-190 is a male monkey of an unknown species whose physical appearance grants it no special abilities, other than increased dexterity and agility. It is often seen wearing a red beanie on its head, horned rim glasses on its eyes, a jade earring on each ear, and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-190 is always carrying a candy stick, which it is known to suck on when under stress.

Personality: SCP-190 is a highly emotional individual, prone to tears of joy or sadness, especially when confronted with sentimental moments in film or art. Its love for music is unparalleled and often brings SCP-190 to tears. Despite its empathetic nature, SCP-190 has a propensity for political intrigue and a shrewd business mind.

Containment Procedure: SCP-190 is to be contained within a soundproofed room where it can access art, music, and media pieces that elicit strong emotions. Due to the possibility of the accidental manipulation of politicians and other influential individuals, SCP-190's containment should be kept under strict supervision at all times.

Note: Despite its emotional nature, SCP-190 is not to be underestimated, as it can be quite skilled in navigating the political landscape to exert its influence. Keep a close eye on its actions and use caution when dealing with SCP-190.
