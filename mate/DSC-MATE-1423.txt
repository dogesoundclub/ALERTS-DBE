SCP-1423, also known as "The Reckless Realtor", is a female human with striking orange stripes adorning her face. She has a unique pair of VR Jade LED eyes that glow ominously, giving her an otherworldly appearance. She wears a blonde Ushanka hat, complementing her jade earring that enhances her unique features. To complete her ensemble, she sports a choker, adding a sense of edginess to her already distinctive persona.

Though SCP-1423 appears quite eccentric, her personality is equally dynamic. She can be reckless, impulsive, and often acts before thinking things through. Her insatiable need for adrenaline and her penchant for showing off have resulted in some amusing situations, like minor accidents or blunders while attempting to impress her acquaintances.

As a real estate agent, SCP-1423 uses her unique features to her advantage, gaining the upper hand in negotiations and winning over potential clients. Her drive and determination coupled with her ability to take risks have resulted in her being a highly sought after agent in the urban fantasy realm.

SCP-1423 remains under observation by the SCP Foundation. Although her unique characteristics make her a valuable asset, her tendency to act impulsively makes her a potential risk in certain situations. Researchers are advised to proceed with caution when interacting with SCP-1423, as her unpredictable nature may lead to dangerous outcomes.
