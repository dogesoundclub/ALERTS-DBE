ITEM #: 5124

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Item 5124 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times. The unit must be equipped with the latest sensory and AI monitoring technology to ensure the integrity of the robotic being. The room is to be dimly lit to avoid activating the LED lights in its eyes. The Traffic Officer is to be monitored through the control panel seen next to the door outside.

DESCRIPTION: Item 5124 is a robotic being of unknown origin. It stands at approximately 5'11'' and has a distinctive blue bandana wrapped around its head. It is equipped with a silver chain and a whistle, which is usually worn around its neck. Its LED eyes have been designed to resemble a rainbow color palette, certainly for identification purposes.

The Traffic Officer's mouth is always frozen in a frightened position, although whether this is the work of its programming or some other unknown factor remains unclear. It converses using an advanced language program and can understand and communicate in most standard languages.

Personality-wise, it displays a hinted level of self-awareness though it's primarily focused on its top priority for traffic control. It can be absent-minded and forgetful during its downtime, though its designated tasks continue uninterrupted.

CAUTIONARY NOTICE: While this humanoid traffic officer may appear harmless, it is best not to provoke or dismiss its position or task. Otherwise, you may unintentionally find yourself breaking traffic laws in the city, leading to serious consequences.
