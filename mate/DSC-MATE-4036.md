Subject 4036, also known as the "Banker Monkey," is an anomalous primate residing in the bustling cityscape of New York. They are a male member of the Simian species, exhibiting a peculiar set of features that make them stand out from other primates. The subject's frightened mouth is permanently curled into a look of perpetual anxiety, as if they are constantly in fear of danger. 

While their eyes remain a mystery, their head has been observed to have a startlingly pink parting, giving the impression of a professional and serious demeanor. Some speculate that this is a result of the long hours the subject spends in their day job as a banker, adding to their already impressive appearance. 

Further examination revealed a pair of impressive jade earrings adorning the subject's ears, providing a stark contrast to their otherwise muted appearance. The subject also appears to be rather fond of their gold chain - a lavish accessory that perhaps hints at a deeper desire for materialistic comfort.

One of the more concerning aspects of this anomalous creature is their tendency to smoke cigarettes, despite the obvious health risks of such a habit. The subject is often seen puffing away, lost in deep thought as they navigate through the stresses of everyday life. 

However, despite the potential dangers of their lifestyle choices, the Banker Monkey remains a deeply caring and nurturing individual. They are willing to go to great lengths to ensure the safety and welfare of their loved ones, often taking on the role of a parental figure, doting on those they care about with a level of dedication that is nothing short of endearing. It is said that their compassion and humor can light up even the darkest corner of the city's urban landscape. 

As always, further observation is required to fully understand the elusive nature of this urban primate, and to grasp the full extent of their capabilities.
