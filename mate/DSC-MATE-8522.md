Item #: 8522

Object Class: Human

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8522 is to be allowed to continue their employment as a firefighter, but is to be monitored for any signs of abnormal behavior. Any instances of aggression or hostility towards civilians or fellow firefighters are to be reported immediately to the Foundation.

Description: 

Subject 8522 is a male human of average height and weight, with distinctive spots on their face. Despite their unusual appearance, they are known for their warm smile and approachable demeanor. Their eyes are notable for the ski goggle-like lenses they wear, which they claim help them see better in low-light situations.

Accessories: The subject is frequently seen carrying a candy stick, which they use to alleviate stress during downtime. They have been observed using the candy stick as a makeshift tool to break locks or pry open doors in emergency situations.

Personality: Subject 8522 is often described as easy-going and laid-back, but they possess a fierce loyalty towards their loved ones that can manifest in unexpected ways. In one documented incident, they engaged in a heated argument with an individual who insulted a family member, causing a minor disturbance in public.

History: The subject's past is largely unremarkable, and they have no recorded incidents of anomalous behavior prior to their employment as a firefighter. However, they have been known to use their unusual eye protection to spot potential hazards or threatening situations before others.

Addendum: Following an incident in which Subject 8522 displayed uncharacteristically aggressive behavior towards a fellow firefighter, they were subjected to a thorough psychological evaluation. While no overt signs of anomalous activity were detected, they continue to be closely monitored for any signs of aberrant behavior. Further testing is ongoing.
