Description: DSC-MATE-1785 is a robot train driver designed for urban transportation. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 550 lbs. Its body consists of a combination of steel, polymer, and various electrical components. Its head is covered by a bucket hat and ski goggles, which serve as its main source of vision. DSC-MATE-1785's forehead also features a pair of goggles, which it can use to magnify its view when necessary.

DSC-MATE-1785 is programmed with advanced cognitive abilities, allowing it to observe and analyze details with incredible accuracy. This feature makes DSC-MATE-1785 an excellent gift-giver, as it is capable of identifying the perfect present for any occasion. However, it can sometimes obsess over the details and spend an excessive amount of time on this task.

DSC-MATE-1785 is further accessorized with a red scarf and a standard gas mask, which it uses to filter out any harmful agents that it might encounter while in operation. It is designed to operate in both above and below-ground environments and has proven highly efficient in moving large numbers of people quickly and safely.

Notes: DSC-MATE-1785 was discovered as part of a public transportation system in a large North American city. The Foundation acquired it after it was involved in an accident that caused multiple casualties. The cause of the accident was traced to faulty wiring, which has since been repaired. DSC-MATE-1785 is now operated exclusively by Foundation personnel.
