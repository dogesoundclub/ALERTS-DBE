SCP Foundation Description:

Containment Protocol:

SCP-9418 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with a monitoring system to ensure the safety of the staff. Any interactions with SCP-9418 should be supervised by at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description:

Subject 9418 is a male human, with a striking appearance that stands out from normal humans. His orange stripes and red clown eyes are indicative of a possible anomalous origin. Indeed, the subject has displayed exceptional observational skills and attention to detail, which may be attributed to anomalous properties.

Facial features also include a two-color band on the forehead that has shown no known significance in behavior or abilities. Despite having potential for great focus, SCP-9418 displays obsessive tendencies related to gift-giving, and sometimes wastes time on the matter.

Personality:

SCP-9418 is a friendly and personable individual with a penchant for giving thoughtful gifts. But his compulsion has the potential to interfere in his daily life, and as such must be monitored. The subject may display obsessive tendencies in decision-making, particularly during gifting events.

While not traditionally dangerous, personnel are warned not to engage in any personal relationships with SCP-9418, to avoid any possible threats from his obsessive behavior.
