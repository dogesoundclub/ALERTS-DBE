Item #: 7026

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 7026 is to be monitored remotely by the Foundation's surveillance system. Physical contact with 7026 must be avoided by all personnel unless approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: 7026 appears to be a human female in her early thirties, measuring approximately 5'8" tall, with green hair that has an edge curl. She has orange eyebrow eyes and often wears a gas mask, which is not required for her survival. This gas mask serves as a precautionary measure for those who may come into close contact with her. She is often seen wearing a gold earring on her left ear and a silver chain.

Personality: 7026 tends to be very empathetic and compassionate, but this can sometimes lead to her taking on other people's problems as her own. She may feel responsible for fixing everything and everyone around her, which can be both admirable and a bit exhausting. Her tendency to involve herself in the troubles of others has led to her current situation inside the Foundation. It is believed that 7026's empathetic nature is the result of her extra-sensory perception, allowing her to feel and sense emotions with greater clarity.

Reports indicate that 7026 is currently working as a reporter for a local news station, where she has been known to report on some of the more peculiar occurrences in the city. Foundation personnel are to keep a close watch on any news reports provided by this station to ensure that no information about the Foundation or other anomalies is released to the public.

Addendum 7026-1: Following Incident 7026-A, 7026 has been fitted with a remote monitoring device to ensure that her whereabouts and activities are continuously tracked. This measure was taken due to her previous actions of involving herself in the affairs of other anomalies, which in turn, led to unwanted attention from the public. 7026's station has also been implanted with a subliminal messaging system to discourage her from reporting on any anomalies in the future.

Addendum 7026-2: At this time, 7026 is not to be used for any testing or experimentation purposes, as her extra-sensory perception may cause unintended consequences. Further study is needed before any significant action can be taken.
