Item #: SCP-1938

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1938 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished to resemble a comfortable and well-lit theater office. Access to SCP-1938 is limited to Level 2 personnel or above, and any interaction with the subject must be recorded and approved by the Site Director.

SCP-1938 is to be allowed to manage a small, local theater company under direct Foundation supervision as part of its containment procedures. The company must not perform any plays containing elements of anomalous activity or themes, nor are they allowed to perform on a stage that has not been checked for anomalies by a trained Foundation technician.

Description: SCP-1938 is a bipedal rabbit, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. It displays no physical abnormalities, other than its anthropomorphic features, and is able to communicate vocally in fluent English. SCP-1938's face prominently features a scared-looking mouth and a pair of glasses atop its rabbit eyes. The subject also wears a bucket hat on its head and a gold earring on each of its ears, with a pair of goggles resting atop its forehead.

SCP-1938 is capable of manipulating anomalous properties through its occupation as a theater manager. Theatrical productions that SCP-1938 manages or appears in have a heightened chance of captivating and enamoring audiences through the use of cognitive anomalies that enhance the suspension of disbelief. SCP-1938 is not directly responsible for the addition of these anomalies and does not appear to understand how they are incorporated into each production.

SCP-1938 has a tendency to be forgetful, losing track of time and appointments, and getting lost in thought while working on a play. These absences leave SCP-1938 vulnerable to emotionally manipulative entities, including type-green memetic objects, and should be monitored closely.

Addendum: Interview 1938-01

Dr. ██████: Good afternoon, SCP-1938. How are you feeling today?

SCP-1938: Oh, just dandy, doc. I'm thrilled to be managing the new play!

Dr. ██████: That's good to hear. Can you tell me anything about the production you're working on?

SCP-1938: It's a comedy, you know. The lead role is played by this amazing actor I found, a real talent. The audience is going to love him- I know it!

Dr. ██████: And does this play contain any anomalous properties, SCP-1938?

SCP-1938: Anomalous? How could it? I'm just a simple theater manager, doc. Nothing irregular or strange about me, or the shows I produce.

Dr. ██████: Understood. Thank you for your time today, SCP-1938.

SCP-1938: Anytime, doc! You know I'm always happy to chat about the theater.
