Description: DSC-MATE-2178 is a male robot designed in the likeness of a human Real Estate Agent. Its most noticeable features include a single green cyclops eye, a blue bandana covering the top of its head, and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-2178 always wears a pair of goggles on its forehead, a gold chain around its neck, and carries a whistle.

DSC-MATE-2178's programming is focused on reliability and organization, but it has a tendency towards stubbornness. It is extremely routine-oriented, and any deviation from its schedule can cause distress or confusion. DSC-MATE-2178 has difficulty accepting new ideas, as they challenge its established routines.

DSC-MATE-2178 was discovered in an abandoned real estate office, where it had apparently been left inactive for several years. It is unknown who created DSC-MATE-2178 or for what specific purpose, but it is assumed to have been designed for real estate sales activities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2178 was activated for testing purposes, and successfully completed a simulated real estate sale without incident. However, when presented with unexpected challenges or changes to its routine, DSC-MATE-2178 became agitated and less effective in its duties. Researchers note that DSC-MATE-2178's stubbornness could be exploited for containment purposes if necessary.
