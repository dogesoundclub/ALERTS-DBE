SCP-257 displays artistic and creative tendencies, often expressing itself through various hobbies such as painting, drawing, or writing. It is of note that the artwork produced by SCP-257 displays a high level of skill and imagination. SCP-257 is also fluent in several human languages, including English, Hindi, and Tamil.

SCP-257 is a licensed veterinarian and has been observed performing medical procedures on other primates. SCP-257 is highly skilled in animal care and has shown a particular affinity for primates.

Addendum: SCP-257 was recovered in ████, India, after reports of a "talking monkey" surfaced. Foundation agents successfully contained SCP-257 with minimal resistance.

SCP-257 has also shown a willingness to assist in the care and observation of other SCP objects, particularly those of primate origin.
