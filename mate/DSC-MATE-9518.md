Item #: DSC-MATE-9518

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9518 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-9518 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. DSC-MATE-9518 is to be provided with daily meals and access to basic amenities including a television set.

Description: DSC-MATE-9518 is a female humanoid identified as a news anchor for a local television station. The subject's physical appearance is normal apart from the presence of orange stripes on her face and purple lips. DSC-MATE-9518 is frequently observed wearing a hoodie and a gold chain as accessories.

DSC-MATE-9518 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, leading to her taking on more tasks than she can handle. This, in turn, leads to humorous situations such as being unable to complete all tasks in a single day or attempting to carry an excessive number of objects at once. The subject appears to be unaware of her anomalous abilities.

DSC-MATE-9518 displays no signs of psychological abnormality, and regular mental health checks have shown no evidence of mental distress. However, due to the subject's ability to take on an excessive workload, it is recommended that her access to assignments be monitored and controlled.

Addendum: Incident Report 9518-01

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-9518 was assigned to report on an incident in which several individuals were seen displaying abnormal behavior. The incident escalated, resulting in a large crowd of individuals with anomalous abilities. DSC-MATE-9518 proceeded to report on the incident as per assignment, but as the situation worsened, she began exhibiting unusual abilities, allowing her to avoid danger and gather further information on the incident.

Once the incident had subsided, DSC-MATE-9518 informed the Foundation of her actions and displayed no memory of her anomalous abilities. It is recommended that DSC-MATE-9518 be monitored more closely in similar assignments.
