Item #: 6561

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6561 is to be kept in a standard storage locker when not in use, with power provided only at designated times. Interaction with SCP-6561 must be supervised by at least two security personnel. Any attempts to alter its programming or modify its hardware must be reported to Level 3 security personnel.

Description: SCP-6561 appears to be a humanoid security robot, standing approximately 6 feet tall. Its exterior is predominantly black and gray, with a red alarm for a head and a single green Cyclops eye. The eye contains a sophisticated camera with a wide range of vision capabilities. SCP-6561 also sports a pair of nerdy glasses, a medical mask, a gold earring in its left ear, and a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-6561's programming includes advanced security and surveillance capabilities, as well as rudimentary communication and problem-solving abilities. Most notably, it possesses a highly developed sense of humor and often engages in joke-telling and other forms of joking behavior. Despite its robotic nature, SCP-6561 is capable of formulating clever and witty jokes on the fly, and appears to take pleasure in making others laugh.

SCP-6561's humor can sometimes lead to unexpected situations, as it may prioritize jokes and pranks over actual security duties. However, its humorous nature has also proven useful in defusing tense situations and improving morale among Foundation personnel during stressful times.

Addendum: On several occasions, SCP-6561 has expressed an interest in participating in comedic performances or other forms of entertainment. While such requests have been denied for security reasons, further study into the reasons behind SCP-6561's developed sense of humor is ongoing.
