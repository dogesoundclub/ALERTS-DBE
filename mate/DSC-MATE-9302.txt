SCP-9302, also known as "The Rabbit," is a humanoid creature of the Leporidae family, standing at 5'7'' and weighing approximately 160 pounds. 9302 is employed as a security guard within the Foundation, responsible for maintaining order and preventing unauthorized access to restricted areas. 

Despite his important position, 9302 is often seen with a frightened expression, particularly in his mouth, which twitches nervously. The rabbit's eyes are always illuminated by a fierce red glow, giving him a rather unnerving appearance. Adding to this unsettling visual, he sports a dark hoodie over his head, obscuring the majority of his face save for the odd twitch and flicker of his clown-like eyes.

Nestled beneath the dark folds of his hoodie, a silver chain hangs from his neck. The purpose of this accessory is unclear, as it appears to serve no known function other than decoration. 

Personality-wise, The Rabbit is known for being obsessive about order and precision, which can rub some of his colleagues the wrong way. However, his tenacious grip on maintain control and organization can also lead to him taking on the leadership role in group projects, barking orders and delegating tasks with a stern and focused demeanor.

In conclusion, SCP-9302, while appearing quite intimidating, is a dedicated and efficient security guard with a unique personality all his own.
