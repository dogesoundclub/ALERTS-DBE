Item #: DSC-MATE-2725

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2725 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its profession as a banker, DSC-MATE-2725 is permitted access to financial software and networks, under surveillance by Foundation personnel at all times. DSC-MATE-2725 is not to be allowed access to large amounts of cash or valuables. All personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-2725 must wear medical masks at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-2725 is a human male, standing at 6 feet tall, with a stout build. Its most notable feature is the presence of spots on its face, which appear to be benign in nature, but have not been surgically removed due to DSC-MATE-2725's resistance to such attempts. DSC-MATE-2725's mouth has been altered to resemble that of a clown, providing a permanent grin to its face. Its eyes are also unnaturally blue and have the appearance of clown eyes.

DSC-MATE-2725 prefers to dress in a monk's habit, despite having no known religious affiliation. It also wears a green cross earring on its left ear. In addition to its clown mouth, DSC-MATE-2725 also dons a medical mask at all times, further obscuring its appearance. DSC-MATE-2725 has been known to be reliable and organized in its work as a banker, but is stubborn in its routines and slow to accept new ideas.

While DSC-MATE-2725 has not exhibited any anomalous abilities, its appearance and behavior suggest that it may have been subjected to an unknown form of alteration. Investigation into DSC-MATE-2725's background is ongoing.

Addendum 2725-A: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-2725 was observed attempting to access the Foundation's financial accounts. Upon questioning, DSC-MATE-2725 claimed to have been "following orders from a higher power." Further investigation into this claim is ongoing. As a precautionary measure, access to all Foundation financial accounts has been restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.
