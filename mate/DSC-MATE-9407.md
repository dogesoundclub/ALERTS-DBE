Description: DSC-MATE-9407 is a male rabbit of average size standing at approximately 60 cm in height. The subject has blue clown eyes that are highly unusual for its species. 9407 wears a hoodie on its head to obscure its face but is known to wear a red scarf around its neck and a normal gas mask.
