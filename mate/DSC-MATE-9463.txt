Item #: SCP-9463

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9463 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber secured with a biometric lock. Access to SCP-9463 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. Any attempt to enter SCP-9463's containment chamber without proper authorization will result in immediate disciplinary actions.

Description: SCP-9463 is a humanoid entity identified as a female veterinarian. SCP-9463 is not believed to possess any anomalous abilities or properties beyond their physical appearance and dry sense of humor. SCP-9463 is adorned with a silver chain accessory and frequently wears a hoodie, although the reason for this is currently unclear.

SCP-9463 is notable for their distinctive orange eyebrow eyes and red lips. While their appearance is not inherently threatening or abnormal, SCP-9463's dry sense of humor often catches individuals off guard. Despite not considering themselves to be a social butterfly, SCP-9463 has a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that are often surprisingly humorous.

While it is believed that SCP-9463 does not require any specialized containment procedures, monitoring of their behavior is necessary to ensure that their humor does not become a source of disruption or disturbance within Foundation facilities.

Addendum: SCP-9463 has expressed an interest in working alongside Foundation researchers to aid in the care of any anomalous entities under Foundation custody. While the potential risk of SCP-9463 becoming aware of certain anomalies is a concern, their expertise in veterinary medicine could prove useful in maintaining the wellbeing of various SCPs. Research staff may submit formal requests to the Site Director to have SCP-9463 consult on projects involving anomalous fauna.
