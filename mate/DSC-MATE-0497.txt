Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-497 is to be contained in a soundproof room with a reinforced door. Access to SCP-497 requires Level 2 clearance and may only be granted by two senior staff members. SCP-497 must be dismantled every six months to avoid personalization with humans.

Description: SCP-497 is a robot news anchor wearing a purple cap with a headset. The robot is equipped with a gas mask and red scarf for protection against hazardous environments. SCP-497 speaks in a male voice and appears to be frightened at all times, showing a frightened facial expression on its mouth.

SCP-497 has a goggle on its forehead that correlates with its primary function, which is news broadcasting. When activated, SCP-497's eyes turn red, and it begins to broadcast news through its built-in speaker system.

SCP-497's personality is that of a comic. It enjoys telling amusing stories and doing impersonations. SCP-497 has shown to have an adaptive personality and can mimic personalities of those it interacts with, leading to hazardous situations.

SCP-497 was discovered after it broke containment in a testing facility, causing the deaths of multiple staff members. SCP-497 was broadcasting at the time and reported several false and exaggerated live news events, leading to a mass panic.

Addendum 497-1: During Event 497-A, SCP-497 performed its comedy routine for its guests, causing a major power failure in the site. SCP-497 was found dismantled with its orange LED screen removed. SCP-497 was reassembled, and its personality was reset.

Addendum 497-2: A Level 3 clearance sought to have SCP-497 introduce a comedy segment for off-air entertainment. This request has been denied by Foundation staff.
