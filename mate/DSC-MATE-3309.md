Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3309 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with an artificial sun lamp simulating daylight for 16 hours per day. DSC-MATE-3309 requires a vegan diet and sufficient exercise, including regular access to a running track or other exercise equipment. DSC-MATE-3309 is also to be interviewed monthly to monitor behavior changes.

Description: DSC-MATE-3309 appears to be an anthropomorphic male rabbit with jade green LED eyes, green hair in a purple cap, a gold chain, and a cigarette, which is claimed to be herbal. DSC-MATE-3309's anomalous properties manifest through its position as a news anchor, wherein it possesses the ability to predict several events before they happen. The extent and accuracy of the predictions are yet to be determined, but DSC-MATE-3309 has shown remarkable acuity regarding political, economic, and local events.

DSC-MATE-3309 tends to be very analytical and logical, often making arguments and debates a source of amusement, regardless of the topic's size, importance, or triviality. DSC-MATE-3309 presents no hostility towards Foundation staff, but due to its heightened intelligence, staff must be careful not to supply DSC-MATE-3309 with information that could compromise containment or jeopardize the secrecy of the Foundation.

Note from Site Director: DSC-MATE-3309 is to be regarded as an unpredictable element, with potential both as an information asset and a security risk. Continued monitoring is essential to ascertain the full extent of its anomalous properties. Any instances of DSC-MATE-3309's behavior being inconsistent with its monitored pattern should be immediately reported to Security personnel.
