Subject 9646, also known as "Tiger Reporter", is a male tiger with a frightened mouth, a pair of nerd glasses for eyes, and a police cap on his head. He sports a jade earring on each ear, along with a red scarf and a normal gas mask as accessories. As a reporter, Tiger Reporter is always on the lookout for a good scoop to share with the world. However, he can be somewhat impulsive and tends to act on his emotions without thinking through the consequences first. Despite this, his spontaneous decisions often lead to humorous situations that others find amusing or surprising. Special care must be taken when dealing with Tiger Reporter as his tiger instincts and reporter's curiosity can often lead him into danger. Nonetheless, he remains a valuable asset in the urban fantasy world with his unending curiosity and a willingness to take on whatever challenge comes his way.
