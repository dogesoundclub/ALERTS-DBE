Item #: SCP-2030

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2030 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Personnel interacting with SCP-2030 must wear protective gear, including gloves and masks, as SCP-2030 is prone to unpredictable outbursts of aggression.

Description: SCP-2030 is a humanoid entity with distinct facial and forehead features. SCP-2030 has orange stripes on her face and red clown eyes, with a noticeable red lip. Two colored bands can be observed on her forehead, with a goggle-like piece of equipment resting on top. SCP-2030 has jade earrings and wears a medical mask at all times, as well as a choker around her neck.

SCP-2030's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence, often refusing help even when it is needed. This stubbornness has resulted in some humorously dangerous situations, such as attempting to move heavy objects alone or refusing to use a map when lost. It is advised that caution is exercised when interacting with SCP-2030, as her temper can be volatile and unpredictable.

SCP-2030's job is that of a beautician, and it is unknown what, if any, anomalous properties her work may hold. Further research is ongoing to determine if SCP-2030's skills have any correlation to her anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-2030's existence was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of unusual behavior at multiple beauty salons. Upon investigation, it was discovered that SCP-2030 had been employed at all locations and was responsible for the odd occurrences. SCP-2030 was apprehended without incident and transported to Site-██.
