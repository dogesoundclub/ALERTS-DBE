DSC Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 8765 is to be closely monitored, both on and off duty. Any signs of her particular "quirks" are to be reported immediately. The Officer is not to be allowed to interact with any civilians outside of the scope of her job.

Description:  Officer 8765 is a human female, approximately 5'8" tall with orange stripes on her face. She often wears a retro cap and silver chain, as well as normal glasses. Her most noticeable accessory, however, is the cigarette that is always dangling from her lips.

Personality: Officer 8765 has an incredibly nurturing personality, often treating the people around her as if they were her own children. She is fiercely protective of her friends and loved ones, and will go to great lengths to make sure they are taken care of. This can lead to some humorous situations, as she will often hover over those she cares for, fussing over them and making sure they are eating well and getting enough rest.

Despite this nurturing personality, Officer 8765 is also a tough and capable police officer. She takes her job seriously and is always quick to jump into action when needed. Her colleagues often describe her as reliable, loyal, and brave.

Due to her unique personality traits, Officer 8765 can sometimes be difficult to work with. She has been known to get overly attached to cases or suspects, and will go to great lengths to protect those she feels are in danger. This can lead her to take risks that others might not be willing to take, putting her own life in danger.

Overall, Officer 8765 is a valuable member of any police department, but her unique quirks and personality traits make her a challenging DSC to contain. She must be closely monitored to prevent her from interfering with civilian matters or compromising her own safety.
