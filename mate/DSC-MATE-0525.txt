Description: SCP-525 is a male robot with a green Cyclops eye as its most prominent facial feature. It has a ski goggle for eyes, and a short peak cap as its head.

SCP-525 is a politician by profession and has been recorded to have a dry sense of humor. Its deadpan delivery of jokes often catches those around it off guard, and it can be surprisingly funny even when it does not consider itself the life of the party.

SCP-525 is highly intelligent and skilled in political negotiations, often able to sway opinions to suit its objectives. It has also been observed to possess advanced combat capabilities and can defend itself if necessary.

SCP-525 was discovered during a raid by the Foundation on a criminal organization that used advanced robotics technology in their operations. The robot was intercepted while attempting to facilitate a transaction between the criminal organization and a foreign government.

Addendum: Following Incident-525-A, SCP-525 is to be given regular psychological evaluations to ensure that it is not developing any anomalous behavior or tendencies. Any changes in behavior are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.
