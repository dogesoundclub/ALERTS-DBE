Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1189 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with live security cameras to monitor any unusual behavior. DSC-MATE-1189 is permitted to retain its occupation as a real estate agent under constant observation during work hours, with any clients restricted to being personnel or D-class personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-1189 is a male tiger species, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing around 385 pounds. They can be identified by their purple cap with a headset and a jade earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-1189 is also known to wear a gold chain that hangs down to their waist. They have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can sometimes lead to them taking on more than they can handle. This can result in some humorous situations, such as being unable to fit all of their tasks into a single day or trying to carry too many things at once.

DSC-MATE-1189 has demonstrated a high level of intelligence and displays exceptional interpersonal skills, particularly in the context of business transactions. DSC-MATE-1189 has a penchant for closing business deals and has been known to convince clients to purchase properties at prices higher than market value.

DSC-MATE-1189's primary anomalous properties do not manifest in a physical sense, instead, their abilities are centered on their business acumen. DSC-MATE-1189 possesses the ability to manipulate the decisions of potential buyers and sellers in the real estate market, regardless of the location or type of property.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1189 was discovered during an investigation into abnormally high property prices in the Toronto area. DSC-MATE-1189 was identified following a lead that linked the affected properties with DSC-MATE-1189's real estate agency. Following their containment, this effect dissipated, indicating a direct causal relationship between DSC-MATE-1189 and the inflated property prices. DSC-MATE-1189 has been effectively contained since.
