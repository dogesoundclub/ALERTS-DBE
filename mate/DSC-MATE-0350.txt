Item #: SCP-350

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-350 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber within Site-██. The chamber must be furnished with a climbing structure, and a variety of toys and puzzles to stimulate SCP-350's intelligence. SCP-350 is to be fed a specialized diet of fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Its eyeglasses must be kept on at all times.

Description: SCP-350 is a male monkey with normal eyesight requiring prescription glasses. SCP-350 stands at approximately 60 cm tall and weighs approximately 8 kg. Its fur is a shade of green not found in any known monkey species. SCP-350 also possesses a single gold earring in its right ear. SCP-350 exhibits a strong sense of responsibility towards its duties as a banker, which has been confirmed through interviews with other employees at the bank. SCP-350 is able to communicate, both verbally and through sign language, and has shown an above-average intelligence for its species.

SCP-350 is friendly and outgoing, often engaging in humorous antics such as dancing or playing pranks on its coworkers. SCP-350's playful nature can sometimes conflict with its sense of responsibility, leading to instances of negligence or forgetfulness. Despite this, SCP-350 has proven to be a valuable asset to its workplace.

SCP-350 was discovered after multiple reports of a "green monkey" working at a bank in ███████. Foundation agents were able to confirm the existence of SCP-350 and transported it to Site-██ for containment.

Addendum: SCP-350's intelligence has been noted to be above average for its species. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of SCP-350's cognitive abilities.
