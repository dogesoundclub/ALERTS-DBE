Item #: DSC-MATE-2598

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2598 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. DSC-MATE-2598 is to be allowed access to basic amenities such as a bed, washing facilities and entertainment within the confines of its containment chamber. Feeding is to be done on a routine basis, with its preference being fast food.

Description: DSC-MATE-2598 appears to be a human female of an unknown ethnicity, standing at 5'6" with a slim build. The subject is often seen wearing a fast-food worker uniform from a popular chain in the United States. The subject has spots on their face, with the most noticeable feature being their red lips. Its clown eyes are red in colour and it has a 2-colour band on its forehead. It wears green cross earrings, a silver chain and often carries a cigarette. 

DSC-MATE-2598 displays an absent-minded and forgetful nature, mainly when it is lost in thought, therefore it must not come into any contact with DSC-963. This nature leads to humorous situations, where the subject can forget appointments and it is not uncommon for it to lose track of time and miss important events.

DSC-MATE-2598 does not possess any anomalous abilities.

Addendum: Due to a containment breach at the DogeSoundClub's Site-115, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-2598 displayed an affinity for anomalous items, as such, it was transferred to Site-19 for the containment of the DSCs contained within. Its position as a mobile fast food worker ensured it could work within the cafeteria of Site-19, without suspicion. It is considered a valuable asset to the containment of several DSC objects.
