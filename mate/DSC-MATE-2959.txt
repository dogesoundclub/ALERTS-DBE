Item #: 2959

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2959 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Access to SCP-2959 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. Under no circumstances should SCP-2959 be allowed to interact with any civilian without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2959 is a human female approximately 28 years of age. SCP-2959 stands at 1.68 meters in height and weighs 68.5 kilograms. SCP-2959's most prominent feature is her orange striped facial markings, which cover the majority of her face. SCP-2959 also has purple lips and orange eyebrows, which are strikingly unusual. SCP-2959's hair is a bright green color and is often seen under a purple cap with the number "69" written on it. SCP-2959 wears a red cross earring and a choker around her neck.

SCP-2959 is a car salesman by profession and has been observed to possess extensive knowledge about various models and makes of cars. SCP-2959 is very outgoing, social, and enjoys being the center of attention. SCP-2959 has been known to captivate audiences with her tales and jokes, which often lead to people laughing for extended periods.

Despite SCP-2959's genial nature, her anomalous properties have been noted to alter people's psychology, causing them to become infatuated with her personality. This effect can last for several weeks or sometimes months after even brief encounters with SCP-2959. Interviews with affected individuals have revealed that they become uncontrollably curious and will go to great lengths to win SCP-2959's attention, often at the detriment of their personal lives.

SCP-2959 was discovered during a routine traffic stop when one of the officers noted the unusual markings on SCP-2959's face. The Foundation was alerted, and SCP-2959 was shortly contained without incident.

Addendum: Despite SCP-2959's social behavior, it is crucial to maintain proper containment procedures to avoid the risk of infection from SCP-2959's anomalous properties. All personnel who interact with SCP-2959 must undergo a psychological evaluation before and after the encounter to ensure that no psychological detriments have occurred.
