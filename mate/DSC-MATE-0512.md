Item #: 512

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-512 is to be kept at Site-██ in a secure storage facility. Access to DSC-MATE-512 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. All interactions with DSC-MATE-512 must be monitored and recorded for analysis.

Description: DSC-MATE-512 is a humanoid robot measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height. It possesses one large, green cyclops eye on its face and a frightened mouth. Its head is covered by a purple cap with a headset attached. DSC-MATE-512 also wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask as accessories.

DSC-MATE-512's primary function was as a delivery driver before being designated an DSC. It is unclear how the robot gained sentience, and further investigation is ongoing. However, DSC-MATE-512 has shown emotions that suggest it has a fondness for music and art that evoke strong feelings. DSC-MATE-512 is also very sensitive to sentimentality in movies and TV shows, and it has been observed to be moved to tears by such moments.

DSC-MATE-512's behavior can be unpredictable at times, and its capabilities and potential for harm are unknown. Therefore, all personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-512 must exercise extreme caution and follow all containment procedures.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-512 provides a unique opportunity for the Foundation to study the nature of artificial intelligence and sentience. Its emotional responses and sensitivity to media with strong emotional content are also of significant interest for further research. However, due to its unpredictable behavior, DSC-MATE-512 must remain under strict containment until fully understood.
