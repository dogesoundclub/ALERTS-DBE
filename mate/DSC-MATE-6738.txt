Item #: SCP-6738

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6738 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to the nature of its job, it is allowed to leave the facility to work at a designated fast-food chain during scheduled shifts. SCP-6738 is not to be allowed access to open flames or any cooking equipment that can be used as an improvised weapon.

Description: SCP-6738 is a tiger of unknown origin, masquerading as a human fast food worker. It stands at 2.1 meters in height and weighs approximately 180 kilograms. It has shown no abnormal aggression towards personnel or the public, although it has been noted to be considerably efficient and organized in its work. It is always seen wearing a red scarf and a hoodie, along with normal glasses and smoked cigarettes. 

SCP-6738 has an inherent desire for control and has been known to assert itself in group settings. This trait is often perceived as controlling or bossy, leading to awkward social situations. SCP-6738 often lends itself to group projects or events and evaluates every detail of the task before delegating duties to others. 

SCP-6738 is adept at multitasking and has been observed performing various functions in the workplace simultaneously, such as taking orders, preparing food, and handling cash. It has an extensive knowledge of the fast-food industry and has been shown to have a strong work ethic. 

SCP-6738 has yet to exhibit any anomalous abilities or behaviors outside of its species and disguising itself as a human. However, further study is required to determine the true nature of SCP-6738 and its motives for adopting a mundane lifestyle. Research is currently in progress. 

Addendum: During a routine interview with SCP-6738, it revealed that it has been living amongst humans for six years now. It claimed to have discovered fast food chains and enjoyed the lifestyle, successfully blending in with humanity. SCP-6738 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, and no incidents have been reported to date. Further investigations are ongoing. 

SCP-6738 Psychological Evaluation: SCP-6738 has shown to have a high degree of organization and control over its surroundings. It desires to be a leader and enforces its power in environments where it can exercise its influence. SCP-6738 has been observed to have a witty sense of humor, which sometimes aids in breaking the monotony of containment. Overall, SCP-6738 has shown no signs of distress or abnormal behavior, but further clinical studies are needed. 

Note: To all personnel: Do NOT engage SCP-6738 in any conversation regarding dietary preferences, as it has shown volatile behavior when discussing fast food options.
