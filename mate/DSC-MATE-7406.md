Subject #7406, also known as "Officer Stripes", is a peculiar individual indeed. A police officer by profession and a human by species, he bears a striking appearance that makes him stand out from the rest. Orange stripes adorn his face, creating a pattern that makes him appear almost feline in nature. But do not let the stripes fool you, for underneath them lies a smile that hides a world of creativity and imagination. Although his glasses cover his eyes, one can sense the gleam of his mind's eye, brimming with new and unique ideas waiting to be unleashed.

His head of parted pink hair only adds to his mystique, a rare and vibrant hue that draws the eye. But what may be even more astonishing is the jade earring that he wears on his left ear, a symbol of strength and protection in some cultures. Though he wears a medical mask on his mouth, it is clear that he is perpetually smiling, even when confronting the darkest of situations.

Completing his intriguing appearance is a gold chain around his neck, adding a touch of stylishness to his uniform. But it is his personality that truly sets him apart from the rest. Officer Stripes is a natural brainstormer, with a mind that is always restless and seeking to solve problems in new and creative ways. This has led to some humorous situations, as he often suggests outlandish solutions just to gauge reactions.

Subject #7406 may appear to be just another police officer, but do not underestimate the feline creativity that hides behind the stripes.
