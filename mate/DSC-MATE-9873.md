DogeSoundClub Containment Report #9873

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9873 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. The enclosure must include ample space for roaming and a variety of cognitive and physical enrichments to ensure the well-being of the subject. Researchers should avoid engaging in verbal debates with DSC-MATE-9873 unless authorized by the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-9873 appears to be a primate resembling a monkey of the genus Cebus, standing approximately 75cm tall and weighing 8kg. DSC-MATE-9873 is sentient and displays extremely keen intelligence, far exceeding that of its non-anomalous counterparts. The primate wears a gold earring in its right ear, a gold chain necklace, and is often seen smoking a cigarette. Its forehead is distinguished by a two-color band pattern.

DSC-MATE-9873 is also known for its sharp wit and passion for debate, frequently provoking discussions with its handlers or other staff members. During conversations, DSC-MATE-9873 employs a range of persuasive techniques, often playing devil's advocate to challenge its interlocutors. These debates are not malicious, and appear to be a form of intellectual stimulation for DSC-MATE-9873.

Despite its sociability and cunning, DSC-MATE-9873 has a history of displaying signs of aggression towards other primates. Handlers should exercise particular caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-9873, who may respond defensively in unpredictable ways. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9873 was recovered from ██████'s Farm, where it was raised by farmers and used to perform manual labor, mainly in farming. While farmers occasionally noted DSC-MATE-9873's intelligence, it was only when Foundation agents began investigating reports of a "talking monkey" that its true abilities began to surface.

Further experimentation should be conducted to assess the full extent of DSC-MATE-9873's capabilities.
