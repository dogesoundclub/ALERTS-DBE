SCP File #44: "The Artistic Reporter" 

Identification number 44 refers to a unique human individual who has exhibited strange physical and mental characteristics, and must be closely monitored due to her potential to disrupt social norms. This individual goes by the name of "The Artistic Reporter," stemming from her aforementioned profession and her penchant for creative expression. 

Physically, 44 is a woman with bright, almost neon-blue eyes that are reminiscent of clown makeup, and sports an unusual orange side for her head. Additionally, she wears a jade earring and silver chain as accessories, though her most distinctive feature is the LED gas mask she dons in many of her public appearances. The exact function of this mask is unknown, but it is believed to be involved in some form of artistic or performative expression. 

Personality-wise, 44 is known to be a highly creative individual with a strong artistic streak. She is deeply passionate about her work as a reporter, often bringing a unique perspective to her stories and generating buzz with her bold and unconventional approach. Her hobbies and interests include painting, drawing, writing, and other forms of creative expression, and she is unapologetic about her nontraditional methods. 

Despite being a relatively new entry to our files, 44 must be approached with caution due to the potential social disturbance she presents. Her attitude and appearance have been known to draw attention, and her reporting style is often polarizing. We recommend taking appropriate measures to ensure public safety when encountering 44 in the wild, and closely monitoring any potential impact she may have on societal norms.
