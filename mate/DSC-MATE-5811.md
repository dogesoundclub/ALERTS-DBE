Item #: 5811

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5811, also known as the Banker, is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. During his stay, he is to be provided with all necessary amenities, including a bed, a desk, and a television with recorded programs of his favorite sitcoms. Security personnel assigned to his chamber are to be advised to avoid playful or humorous interactions with the subject, as this could result in breaches of containment.

Description: Subject 5811 is a human male, approximately 35 years of age. It is noted that the subject has a distinct appearance, characterized by orange stripes and red clown eyes. Additionally, he wears a police cap, a gold earring, and a red scarf, along with carrying a candy stick. Despite these features, he remains mostly unremarkable in his appearance.

Subject 5811 is known to exhibit a strong sense of responsibility and duty. This trait is often demonstrated through his job as a banker, in which he is meticulous and diligent, with an excellent record of service. On the other hand, the subject is known to be playful and sociable. He enjoys engaging with others and is often the life of the party. These two seemingly contradictory traits often lead to humorous situations, such as getting everyone to dance or sing along to his favorite songs.

Despite the subject's benign nature, care must be taken not to allow him to interact with anyone outside of his containment. It is unknown if the subject's playful tendencies could be used to compromise security or facilitate an escape.

Addendum: Due to the positive behavior exhibited by subject 5811, it has been deemed unnecessary to administer any type of Class-A amnestics. Future containment protocols should reflect this leniency, and extra care should be taken in ensuring that the subject is comfortable and engaged during its containment.
