Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3375 is to be housed in a reinforced containment chamber with a metal floor and walls to prevent escape. The temperature must be kept at a constant 25Â°C to ensure comfort for the subject. SCP-3375 is to be provided with a soft bed and multiple toys to prevent boredom. It is crucial to note that SCP-3375 must not come in contact with any other anomalous subjects as it may cause severe injury or death.

Description: SCP-3375 appears to be a male tiger with red clown eyes and a frightened mouth. It wears a hoodie and a shiny gold chain on its neck. SCP-3375 displays a high level of intelligence and an almost human-like personality. It is capable of understanding and communicating in the English language but prefers to communicate through non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions.

SCP-3375 is prone to erratic and impulsive behavior, which can result in dangerous situations. It enjoys taking risks and jumping off cliffs into the water with no regard for its safety. However, SCP-3375's behavior can be unpredictable and is not guaranteed to act in the same way repeatedly.

SCP-3375's mechanical skills are remarkable and have been observed tinkering and fixing complex machines with ease. It is unknown how SCP-3375 developed its mechanical skills but should not be underestimated as they may be using their skills to escape containment.

Addendum: SCP-3375 is not to be underestimated despite their comical appearance and personality. We have yet to determine the full extent of SCP-3375's abilities, and it is crucial to ensure they remain contained. Any signs of escape or erratic behavior are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.
