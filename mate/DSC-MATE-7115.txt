Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7115 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-7115 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. All interactions with SCP-7115 must be recorded for analysis.

Description: SCP-7115 is a human male in his late 30s, identified as the Theater Manager of [REDACTED]. SCP-7115 exhibits several physical anomalies, including a distinct spot on his mouth, ski goggle eyes, and a purple cap with a headset. SCP-7115's ears are adorned with a green cross earring, and he wears a gold chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-7115 displays a highly detail-oriented personality, often exhibiting obsessive tendencies in everyday tasks such as alphabetizing his spice rack or color-coding his closet. SCP-7115 is highly proficient in theater management and possesses an extensive knowledge of stage production.

Interviews with SCP-7115 reveal a calm and collected individual with a penchant for order and precision. SCP-████, a Level 3 researcher, suggested that SCP-7115 may exhibit signs of mild OCD, and further testing is underway to confirm this hypothesis.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, an incident occurred in SCP-7115's containment chamber. SCP-7115 was found to have organized his clothing in a specific order and proceeded to rearrange the contents of his room to fit the new organization. SCP-7115 exhibited signs of distress when detained by security personnel and was sedated for further examination. Results indicate that SCP-7115 may be vulnerable to moments of increased anxiety, resulting in more compulsive behavior.

SCP-7115's containment procedures have been updated to account for possible future incidents of this nature. Research is ongoing to better understand SCP-7115's physical and psychological anomalies. Further testing and analysis are required.
