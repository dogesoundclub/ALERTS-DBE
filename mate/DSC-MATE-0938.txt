Subject 938, also known as "The Joker", is a male human with striking orange stripes adorning his face - a physical trait that serves to intimidate and disorient his targets. The subject's eyes possess VR jade LED technology, giving them a hauntingly unnatural and piercing quality. His head is decorated with a head of normal blonde hair, which he keeps styled in a neat and fashionable cut. 

However, what truly sets Subject 938 apart is his preference for wearing a medical mask obscuring his mouth. The reasons for this are unknown, leading many to speculate that the subject suffers from some form of disfigurement or is hiding a secret identity. Completing his look is a silver chain, which hangs around his neck like a talisman. 

Subjects who have encountered 938 describe him as having a dry sense of humor that takes people off guard. Despite his unassuming demeanor, he has a knack for delivering deadpan jokes with excellent timing, often taking people by surprise. Some believe this to be intentional, as he seems to relish in the confusion it creates. 

Make no mistake, however - Subject 938 is a known villain and should be approached with caution. His powers and abilities are still being researched, but what is known is that he is a formidable opponent, with a cunning and unpredictable nature that makes him a serious threat to anyone who opposes him.
