Item #: SCP-8684

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8684 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. He is to be provided with a regular medical check-up and any needed treatments. SCP-8684 is allowed to perform veterinarian duties under the supervision of the Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-8684 is a human male, appearing to be in his early thirties, with green layers covering his head. His mouth area is obscured by a medical mask, and he often shows a frightened expression with his mouth slightly opened. SCP-8684 is commonly seen wearing a red scarf, which he claims is his lucky charm.

SCP-8684's primary occupation is as a veterinarian, which he has been practicing for approximately 8 years. He demonstrates great knowledge and skill in the handling of animals, but he also has a tendency to be stubborn and opposed to change. SCP-8684 is easily worried and hesitant, and he often struggles to adapt to unforeseen situations or events.

SCP-8684 is, for the most part, cooperative and obedient to authority, but he can be difficult at times, especially when his routines or plans are interrupted. He is highly organized and reliable but lacks flexibility and may need extra encouragement to accept new ideas.

Addendum: SCP-8684's attachment to his red scarf has been noted as a peculiar aspect of his behavior. The origin of this obsession is currently unknown, but it is believed that its significance is related to his over-protective nature towards animals, as he sees himself as a protector and nurturer. Further investigation is needed to determine if this object holds any anomalous properties.
