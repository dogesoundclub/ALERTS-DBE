SCP-2232, also known as "The Train Hopper‚Äù, is an anomalous male rabbit of unknown origin. With vibrant red clown eyes and a head adorned with a police cap, SCP-2232 is easily distinguishable from its non-anomalous counterparts. Additionally, SCP-2232's ears feature a golden earring and it is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-2232's primary job is that of a train driver, and it is known to actively seek out employment within the railroad industry. Despite its unique appearance, SCP-2232 presents itself as a well-mannered and reliable employee. However, it is believed that SCP-2232's motivations for seeking out such employment may not be solely based on the desire for steady work.

SCP-2232's personality is described as outgoing and social, making it a popular figure amongst both humans and anomalous entities alike. It often seeks to be the center of attention, using its comedic wit and charisma to charm those around it. However, it is important to note that SCP-2232's humor can sometimes be unsettling or disturbing to some individuals.

Due to the nature of its train-driving duties, SCP-2232 is equipped with a normal gas mask as a precautionary measure. However, its effectiveness in protecting SCP-2232 from anomalous substances or entities is unknown.

As with all anomalous entities, caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-2232. It is recommended that Foundation personnel refrain from laughing at SCP-2232's jokes or stories, as it is believed that doing so may cause unintended consequences. Further research is ongoing to determine the full extent of SCP-2232's anomalous abilities and motivations.
