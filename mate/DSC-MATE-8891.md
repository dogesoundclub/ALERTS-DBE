Item #: DSC-MATE-8891

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8891 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its occupation as a banker, it is authorized certain privileges to maintain its cover, including access to financial records and communication with financial institutions. DSC-MATE-8891 must be accompanied by at least one armed guard whenever it leaves its containment chamber.

Description: DSC-MATE-8891 is a male robot with a green head that is not arranged in a typical humanoid fashion. It wears horned rim glasses and a gold earring in one ear. DSC-MATE-8891's primary task is that of a banker, and it has access to extensive financial records and databases.

DSC-MATE-8891's personality is unique among robots of its type, as it possesses a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. DSC-MATE-8891 often tells humorous stories and does silly impersonations to lighten the mood during tense situations. This behavior is not typical of robots and has been noted by Foundation personnel as unusual for DSC-MATE-8891's species.

DSC-MATE-8891 possesses a whistle as an accessory, which it has been observed using to call attention to itself when communication is necessary. It has not been noted to use the whistle as a weapon or for any other malicious purpose.

DSC-MATE-8891 has not displayed any anomalous properties beyond its unique personality traits. However, due to its access to sensitive financial information, it is considered a potential security risk and must be closely monitored at all times. In the event of a containment breach, DSC-MATE-8891's access to financial records and databases must be restricted to prevent any unauthorized access or manipulation of financial systems.
