Item #: SCP-656

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-656 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment locker within Site-██. Access to SCP-656 is limited to Level 2 personnel and above with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel. Any requests for interaction with SCP-656 must be approved by Dr. ███████.

Description: SCP-656 is a human female of African-American descent, approximately 35 years of age with prominent spots on her cheeks, a purple lip, and a purple cap with a headset. SCP-656's ears are adorned with gold earrings, and she is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck and holding a cigarette.

SCP-656 is a veterinarian by profession and displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards her patients. However, she also has a fun-loving personality that can lead to humorous situations, including but not limited to, being the life of the party, singing and dancing with people around her.

SCP-656's anomalous abilities include the unique ability to calm down any animal that is distressed or riled up. She has demonstrated this ability on several animals, including elephants, tigers, and bears. However, it is unclear how SCP-656 is able to achieve this effect, as it does not seem to be due to any known mechanism or chemical reaction.

Despite SCP-656's human nature, her ability and personality traits have been deemed worthy of SCP classification due to their unusual and unexplained nature. As such, any interaction with SCP-656 must be closely monitored and approved by relevant personnel. It is also recommended that SCP-656 be kept under observation for any further anomalous abilities or behavior.
