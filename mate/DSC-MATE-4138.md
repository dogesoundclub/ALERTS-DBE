Item #: DSC-MATE-4138

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4138 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a microphone, camera, and internet connection. Any communication made by DSC-MATE-4138 is to be monitored and recorded at all times. All personal belongings, including the gold chain and cigarette, are to be confiscated and examined to ensure no anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-4138 is permitted to record news segments for local broadcast, but all scripts must be vetted by Foundation personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-4138 appears to be a normal human female with the exception of its green jade LED eyes and the goggle affixed to its forehead. DSC-MATE-4138's right ear is adorned with a Red Cross earring. DSC-MATE-4138 is employed as a news anchor, but its reporting often stretches beyond typical journalistic standards, with an emphasis on uncovering paranormal or anomalous events.

DSC-MATE-4138 has demonstrated a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which has led to it taking on more than it can realistically handle. This has resulted in several humorous situations, such as attempting to carry too many objects at once or having too many tasks to complete within a single day. It is unclear whether this behavior is a result of DSC-MATE-4138â€™s anomalous nature or a personal quirk.

DSC-MATE-4138's broadcasts have gained a following among individuals with an interest in the paranormal, and several incidents of DSC-MATE-4138 interacting with anomalous entities have been documented. However, DSC-MATE-4138's reporting has also drawn unwanted attention from hostile paranormal entities, necessitating Foundation involvement to ensure its safety.

Addendum: Investigation into the origins of DSC-MATE-4138's anomalous properties is ongoing. Preliminary analysis suggests a potential link to a current GOI known to study and manipulate reality-warping anomalies. Further investigation is necessary to confirm this link.
