Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3832 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. All personnel entering DSC-MATE-3832's cell must wear Level 3 containment suits due to the risk of contracting DSC-MATE-3832's unique strain of simian tuberculosis. DSC-MATE-3832 is allowed to smoke his cigarette, but the ashtray must be monitored closely to prevent any accidental fires. All educational materials brought into DSC-MATE-3832's cell must be pre-approved by Site Director Johnson.

Description: DSC-MATE-3832 appears to be a male rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) standing at 1.5 meters tall and weighing approximately 40 kg. DSC-MATE-3832 possesses typical features for a rhesus macaque, including a pink face, black fur, and a long tail. However, DSC-MATE-3832 has several distinguishing features, including a pair of nerd glasses, a scarlet scarf, and a cigarette that he almost always has in his mouth.

DSC-MATE-3832 is a highly intelligent simian, with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He spends hours each day reading and researching an eclectic range of subjects, from astrophysics to ancient mythology. He is often seen sitting cross-legged on his bed, pouring through books, and taking notes on a tattered yellow legal pad. DSC-MATE-3832 has even been known to request educational documentaries from Site-17's library, which he watches on a small TV in his cell.

Despite his erudite personality, DSC-MATE-3832 is highly enigmatic and unpredictable. He has been recorded speaking in full sentences and displaying a remarkable aptitude for sign language. However, DSC-MATE-3832 often becomes agitated and unpredictable, especially when discussing his life before he was captured by the Foundation. DSC-MATE-3832 has admitted to being a former high ranking member of a criminal organization, believed to be the Italian Mafia.

DSC-MATE-3832's special containment procedures must be followed strictly to prevent his sudden outbursts and maintain the order in Site-17.
