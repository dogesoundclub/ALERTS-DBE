Description: Subject 2509, identified as a traffic officer within local law enforcement, presents with distinctive facial features.

In the field of study surrounding supernatural phenomena, a silver chain can often offer some protection against spirits or entities that may attempt to take root in human hosts. Subject 2509 habitually adorns himself with such an item, indicating a certain level of familiarity with this topic.

The subject displays a strong proclivity towards planning and order, though he has also shown a spontaneous side that can often lead to novel situations. He has been noted to surprise his friends with impromptu adventures or small get-togethers that prove to be quite successful. It is imperative to record any further incidents related to this aspect of the subject's personality.

Additional Notes: The subject has not generated any anomalous readings as of yet, and his employment in local law enforcement provides ample cover for any incidents related to the supernatural. However, further evaluation is recommended to determine the true extent of the subject's involvement within the community.
