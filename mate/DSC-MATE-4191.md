Item #: DSC-MATE-4191

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4191 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Physical contact with DSC-MATE-4191 should be avoided at all times, as its anomalous properties only manifest when the subject is within close proximity. Due to its activity as a traffic officer, DSC-MATE-4191 is allowed to remain in its current state of occupation with a cover story of being an undercover police officer.

Description: DSC-MATE-4191 is a female human of average height and build, with noticeable facial features including an orange stripe-patterned marking on its right cheek and purple lipstick. The subject's head is green in color and is crowned with distinct curly edges, while its eyebrows are orange and shaped with sharp angles. DSC-MATE-4191 also wears a green cross earring on its left ear.

DSC-MATE-4191's anomalous properties manifest when it is within close range of any transportation vehicles, including automobiles, trains, planes, and boats. When within range, DSC-MATE-4191 gains the ability to exert minor telekinetic control over the vehicle, causing it to swerve, accelerate or decelerate erratically. This ability also extends to traffic lights and road signs, which DSC-MATE-4191 can manipulate to create chaotic traffic conditions.

DSC-MATE-4191's personality is unpredictable, displaying a reckless and impulsive nature which can lead to humorous incidents such as driving into stationary objects while showing off for others. Its motivation for causing these accidents remains unclear, though it has been observed to display a noticeable sense of satisfaction when triggering them. DSC-MATE-4191 also displays a preference for bright, flamboyant clothing.
