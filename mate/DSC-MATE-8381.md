Item #: 8381

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8381 must be monitored at all times, and all interactions between the subject and civilians must be recorded. The subject is not to be left alone with other individuals for extended periods of time. In the event of a possible Containment Breach, Foundation personnel must engage with caution, as the subject has been known to exhibit extreme aggression.

Description: 8381 is a male human in his late thirties, approximately 6 feet tall, with a distinctive peak spike hairstyle. He is often found wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette. The subject wears normal glasses, which he constantly adjusts on his face. Despite appearing mundane, several tests have indicated that the subject possesses highly advanced cognitive abilities. It is believed that the subject's analytical and logical nature contributes to his exceptional problem-solving skills.

The subject has displayed a dry sense of humor and often makes witty observations or teases his colleagues in a deadpan manner. He has been known to exhibit occasional bouts of aggression, resulting in several incidents of violent behavior. Foundation personnel hypothesize that these incidents may be linked to a traumatic past experience.

8381 is employed as a Police Officer, and the Foundation has managed to secure his position in the police department as a cover for his true nature. His job provides him with ample opportunities to gather information and interact with numerous individuals. It is recommended that the subject receive psychiatric evaluations at regular intervals to monitor any changes in behavior.

Addendum: Following Incident 8381-Alpha, the subject's employment as a Police Officer has been reviewed. It has been decided that the subject is to remain in his position due to the valuable intel he is able to gather in his role. However, stricter monitoring and psychological assessments will be implemented to ensure that the subject is not a threat to the public or Foundation operatives.
