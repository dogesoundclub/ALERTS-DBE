Item #: 2872
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2872 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a variety of toys and stimulation devices. As 2872 has been deemed a hazard to public safety, all contact with human beings must be monitored at all times.

Description: 2872 is a male monkey, approximately 5 feet in height. He has been observed to wear a red beanie and a pair of nerdy glasses, accessorized with a silver chain and a cigarette. He has an affinity for jade jewelry and refuses to remove a small earring in his left ear.

Personality: 2872 is an imaginative creature with an intense love for creativity. He is often seen creating unique cosplay costumes or writing poetry, and has even been known to collect unusual objects. While 2872 is generally well-mannered and friendly, he has been known to become aggressive when threatened or cornered.

In spite of his appearance, 2872 has somehow managed to obtain an official position as a traffic officer. Although his job is to ensure public safety, it is worth noting that he is a danger to humans, often causing chaos and destruction with his eccentric behavior.

Due to his unstable tendencies, it is recommended that any interaction with 2872 be carefully monitored and recorded. Further study and research on the nature of his anomalous behavior is ongoing.
