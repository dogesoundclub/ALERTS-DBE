SCP-8447 is a curious specimen in our urban fantasy universe, defying expectations with their bold appearance and commanding presence. As a banker, they have access to vast resources and wield them with confidence, a testament to their natural talent for leadership. Their striking appearance only enhances their unique personality, with spotted skin drawing attention to their sharp features, a bold mohawk sitting atop their head as a symbol of power.

Behind their nerdy glasses, SCP-8447's eyes are shrewd and calculating, always scanning their surroundings for potential threats or opportunities. They keep a goggle on their forehead, ready to don it when necessary for maximum visibility. A jade earring in their ear represents a deeper connection to the supernatural world, hinting at their potential for greater insight and magical abilities. 

A medical mask over their mouth suggests a practical and cautious attitude, prioritizing safety and security above all else. However, this does not diminish their commanding presence, as they continue to take charge of any situation they find themselves in. SCP-8447 is a dynamic figure, both powerful and practical, with a natural charisma that draws others towards them. They may prove to be a valuable ally or dangerous opponent, depending on their goals and motivations.
