Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2087 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a specialized ventilation system that constantly circulates air to ensure a suitable environment. DSC-MATE-2087 is not to come into contact with any other DSC or Foundation personnel without prior approval from the Site Director. Access to DSC-MATE-2087's personal belongings is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Description: DSC-MATE-2087 is an anthropomorphic rabbit of male gender. DSC-MATE-2087 appears to be a doctor and sometimes responds to the name "Doctor Hare." DSC-MATE-2087 is generally cooperative and complies with all instructions from Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-2087's physical appearance is not of considerable note, except for the gold earring in his left ear, a red scarf around his neck, and a cigarette clutched firmly in his mouth. DSC-MATE-2087 displays a highly detail-oriented personality, which can be observed in even the most mundane of tasks.

DSC-MATE-2087's most significant trait is its obsession with organization and perfection. It is known to alphabetize spice racks, color-code closets, and even categorize the most appalling medical waste with a meticulous eye. This obsessive attention to detail can prove both a gift and a curse, allowing DSC-MATE-2087 to excel as a doctor but also leading to anxiety and compulsive behavior.

DSC-MATE-2087 is not hostile but may become irritated or agitated when his orderly environment is disturbed or disordered. This could result in minor outbursts, but DSC-MATE-2087 has yet to present a serious security risk.

Addendum: Recent medical examinations indicate a slightly above-average IQ for DSC-MATE-2087. It is recommended that DSC-MATE-2087 be allowed to read medical journals and textbooks to alleviate boredom and maintain his well-being. Future tests are being planned to determine if DSC-MATE-2087's intellect can be exploited by the Foundation.
