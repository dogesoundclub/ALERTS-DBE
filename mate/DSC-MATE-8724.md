Item #: DSC-MATE-8724

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8724 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any requests made by DSC-MATE-8724 must be approved by Level-3 personnel. In order to appease DSC-MATE-8724's nurturing tendencies, personnel may provide it with various toys or stuffed animals on a monthly basis.

Description: DSC-MATE-8724 appears to be a male rabbit of standard size and build, with green fur that has not been arranged. DSC-MATE-8724 has been observed wearing normal glasses and a gold earring in each ear. It also wears a gold chain around its neck and a LED gas mask as a form of respiratory protection.

DSC-MATE-8724 displays an extremely caring and nurturing personality, often treating those around it as if they were its own children. This has led to a number of humorous situations, particularly when dealing with other humanoid DSCs who are not interested in being treated as children. Despite its friendly demeanor, DSC-MATE-8724 displays an above-average level of intelligence and is particularly skilled in software programming.

DSC-MATE-8724's origins are unknown, but it has claimed to have worked as a programmer prior to containment. How it acquired its current form is also unknown. While DSC-MATE-8724 is not particularly aggressive, it has been known to display moments of frustration or even anger when its nurturing instincts are challenged or thwarted.

Addendum: Personnel are reminded that while DSC-MATE-8724 may seem harmless, its ability to manipulate programming and other computer-based systems makes it a valuable asset in containment and other specialized tasks. Care should be taken to ensure its well-being and cooperation.
