SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: 2983

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-2983 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with a specialized ventilation system capable of filtering cigarette smoke. Access to outdoor areas must be limited due to its excessive risk-taking behavior.

Description:

SCP-2983 is a female humanoid identified as a mechanic with a love for adventure. Its face features a constant smile and its eyes are replaced with VR rainbow LED lenses, which it claims provide an enhanced view of the world.

SCP-2983's head is partially dyed orange, and it wears a gold earring in one ear. It is often seen with a cigarette in hand, despite being advised against smoking for health reasons.

SCP-2983's love for adventure and risk-taking can lead to dangerous situations, such as near-death experiences while participating in extreme sports or getting lost in remote locations. However, it possesses a remarkable ability to survive these situations and make it out alive.

SCP-2983's personality quirks and love for adventure have made it a favorite among Foundation personnel, who often request permission to interact with it outside of containment. However, its anomalous behavior must be closely monitored to prevent any breaches or accidents.
