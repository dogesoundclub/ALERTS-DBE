Item #: 8295

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Object 8295 is to be kept in a locked room at all times. No unauthorized personnel should be allowed access to the object. Object should only be approached by Level 4 personnel wearing full protective gear.

Description: Object 8295 is a male robot with a frightened mouth feature. It wears horned rim glasses over its mechanical eyes, and a bucket hat atop its head. Its mouth is covered by a medical mask, and it is often seen sporting a gold chain as an accessory.

Object 8295's main occupation is that of a veterinarian, but unlike any human veterinarian, it is believed to be capable of medical miracles. This robot is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with new and creative solutions to any given problem. Its outlandish and unorthodox methods are often met with amusement by its peers.

While not much is known about Object 8295's origin, rumors have spread that it may have been designed by a team of rogue scientists who sought to create an ultimate healing machine. Nevertheless, Object 8295's abilities have not been fully neared to cracking, hence the cautionary confinement procedures.

Additional Notes: Object 8295's rare species of robot is yet to be discovered. All attempts to study the machine directly or indirectly through imaging have met with failure. Besides, its once-yellow exterior seems to have dulled with age, leading to concerns about its maintenance and stability. Only time will tell when it will require repairs, and the Foundation is standing at the ready for when that day arrives.
