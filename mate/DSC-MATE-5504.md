Item #: DSC-MATE-5504

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5504 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Due to the docile nature of DSC-MATE-5504, minimal security is required. DSC-MATE-5504 requests to have her personal art supplies readily available to her while in containment.

Description: DSC-MATE-5504 is a human female of indeterminate age, but believed to be between the ages of 30-40 years old. DSC-MATE-5504 has a unique appearance, with orange stripes running along the sides of her face, and orange eyebrows. DSC-MATE-5504 also has a set of wings on her head, believed to be ornamental in nature, rather than functional. DSC-MATE-5504’s ears are adorned with jade earrings, and she is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace. DSC-MATE-5504 is frequently depicted holding a cigarette in her hand, but no ill effects related to smoking have been observed.

DSC-MATE-5504 works as a veterinarian in her non-anomalous life. However, she also possesses a strong artistic inclination, using various mediums such as watercolor, acrylic, and charcoal to express herself. DSC-MATE-5504 requests to have access to these supplies while in containment and has cooperated with Foundation personnel in creating pieces of art for display.

DSC-MATE-5504’s personality is characterized as introverted and reserved, but with a strong creative drive. She enjoys solitude and often requests to work alone. She has shown no violent tendencies and is fully cooperative with Foundation staff.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5504's anomalous properties were discovered when she reported unusual side effects occurring in some animals that she treated, including sudden sprouting of wings or tails, and changes in fur or scale colors. Foundation personnel investigated and discovered that DSC-MATE-5504 had an innate ability to imbue her artwork with anomalous properties. Dr. ██████ has recommended DSC-MATE-5504 be transferred to a research team for further study of her anomalous abilities.
