SCP-2680's eyes are blue and the shape of clown eyes. They wear a red scarf around their neck and usually carry a candy stick with them.

SCP-2680 is known for their charisma, making them popular with customers. SCP-2680 has an innate ability to connect with others and can easily establish rapport with individuals. This often leads to some humorous situations where strangers have shared personal details of their life stories or awkwardly funny anecdotes.
