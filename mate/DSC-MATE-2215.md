Item #: DSC-MATE-2215

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2215 is to be assigned to regular police duties in a designated urban area. DSC-MATE-2215's movements and actions are to be tracked and monitored by Foundation personnel at all times. Any deviations from the assigned duties or violations in normal protocol are to be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-2215 is a human male in his mid-twenties, with an affinity towards taking spontaneous risks and acting on impulse. DSC-MATE-2215 is characterized by his distinctive appearance - wearing a black hoodie and medical mask, and has a noticeable gold chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-2215's hazardous behavior pattern has resulted in numerous situations where the lives of himself and others were put in danger. They have been known to engage in activities such as cliff diving, street racing, and other thrill-seeking activities. DSC-MATE-2215's apparent disregard for their own safety has led to increased caution among Foundation personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-2215.

Interview logs and psychological assessments have shown that DSC-MATE-2215's impulsive tendencies may be due to unresolved personal trauma. However, further investigation into this angle is yet to be undertaken.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2215's recklessness has made them a liability to containment procedures. As such, the Foundation is exploring possible ways to mitigate DSC-MATE-2215's risk-taking behavior. Suggestions for alternative in-house or on-site roles have been proposed and may be implemented upon the approval of the Site Director.
