Item #: SCP-4798

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4798 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls, ceiling and floor. Access to the chamber is strictly prohibited except for authorized personnel. SCP-4798 is allowed one pack of cigarettes per day, and it is to be provided only by Class-D personnel under supervision.

Description: SCP-4798 is a male tiger in his early 30s, standing at 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 700 pounds. SCP-4798's face feature includes a permanent state of a frightened mouth, which contrasts with the blue clown-like eyes that gaze at all visitors with playful curiosity. SCP-4798's head is adorned with a blue bandana, which is believed to be a remnant of its time living as a member of a biker gang. SCP-4798 also maintains a jade earring, possibly a souvenir from its past life.

SCP-4798's primary occupation before containment is believed to be a car salesman, although the way of how SCP-4798 got into this profession is still unknown. SCP-4798 possesses a considerable amount of persuasive skills, as well as a strong ability to read the emotions of others. These skills make it incredibly effective in its occupation as a salesman, often convincing potential customers to purchase a vehicle against their will.

SCP-4798's psychological examination suggests that it has a strong sense of empathy, which may have contributed to its persuasive skills. SCP-4798 is attuned to the emotions of others and can pick up on subtle cues that most people overlook. SCP-4798 often uses its skills to help others in humorous ways, making it a popular figure amongst the Foundation staff.

Addendum: SCP-4798 has requested to be transferred to a standard human cell to experience life as a human. This request is currently under review.
