SCP-8722 is a human male, identified as a reporter for the local newspaper. His physical appearance is defined by the VR Jade LED eyes, which emit an eerie, bio-luminescent green color. The retro cap on his head, combined with the goggle on his forehead, give him an old-timey appearance, reminiscent of early 20th century adventurers or explorers. He usually wears a silver chain around his neck, which may hold sentimental value for him.

SCP-8722's personality traits are complex and multi-faceted. On one hand, they can be highly reliable and organized in their work, able to stick to deadlines and meet targets. However, they also have a stubborn streak that can be challenging for others to deal with. They may find it difficult to accept new ideas or adapt to unexpected changes, leading to some humorous and potentially dangerous situations at times.

It is recommended that SCP-8722 be monitored closely for any signs of resistance to change or inability to work collaboratively with others. Despite these challenges, his role as a reporter could prove invaluable in uncovering the hidden secrets of the supernatural world, and his perseverance may ultimately prove to be an asset in the fight against paranormal threats to our world.
