SCP-1371, also known as the "Tiger Salesman," is a male tiger who works as a car salesman. His frightened mouth and nerd glasses give him a timid appearance, but don't let his looks deceive you. SCP-1371 is known to be sly and cunning, able to convince customers to purchase cars they don't need, often at inflated prices. 

SCP-1371 seems to have a fondness for sentimental moments, often becoming emotional while watching movies or TV shows that evoke strong feelings. He also has an appreciation for music and art that can move him to tears. 

Despite his soft side, SCP-1371 has been known to use his tiger instincts to intimidate customers and manipulate them into buying cars they can't afford. He has been flagged by local authorities for suspicion of fraudulent sales practices, leading the Foundation to keep a close eye on his activities. 

SCP-1371 is often seen wearing a blue bandana and a red scarf, which he claims are for good luck. However, the true purpose of these accessories is unknown. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to be persuaded into purchasing a car from SCP-1371 without prior approval.
