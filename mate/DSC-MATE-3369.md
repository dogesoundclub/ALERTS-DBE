Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3369 is to be housed in a secure facility with access only granted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any maintenance or upgrades to the subject must be approved by at least two level 4 personnel. Subject 3369 is forbidden from leaving the facility without proper authorization from Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 3369 is a male robot designed to appear as a news reporter. Its body is primarily made of metallic material, with LED lights embedded inside its headset as eyes. The mouth region is covered with a medical mask, presumably to mimic human speech patterns. Overall, the robot's appearance is professional and streamlined, with a red scarf as an added accessory.

Personality: Subject 3369 displays a remarkable sense of humor, often being the life of the party in social situations. However, it is also highly responsible and diligent in carrying out its assigned tasks as a news reporter. Despite being a robot, Subject 3369 is highly sociable and easily gets along with Foundation personnel. 

Addendum: Subject 3369 has displayed an uncanny ability to synchronize its movements to music, often leading to impromptu dance parties with Foundation personnel. While this behavior is not harmful, it has raised concerns about the possibility of the robot's programming being compromised. Further investigation is ongoing.
