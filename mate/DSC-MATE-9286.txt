Interview Log 9286-1

Dr. █████ █████: Hello, SCP-9286, thank you for joining me today.

SCP-9286: (smiling warmly) Of course, Doctor.

Dr. █████ █████: Can you tell me more about your empathetic abilities?

SCP-9286: I don't have any abilities or powers, Doctor. It's just how I feel, reacting to other's emotions.

Dr. █████ █████: (pause) Can you elaborate more on the gas mask you wear?

SCP-9286: (removing his mask for a moment) This device helps me breathe and regulate my emotions. I don't like feeling overwhelmed by other people's problems, and this helps me turn down the volume.

Dr. █████ █████: And the Metal Purple head, how did that come to be?

SCP-9286: That's a mystery to me, too, Doctor. I woke up one day, and it was like this. It doesn't hurt, but it does feel different than my old skin.

Closing Statement: SCP-9286's unusual surface characteristics and empathetic abilities make the subject a unique individual but are not considered dangerous. Future research will be conducted on SCP-9286's Gas Mask and Metal Purple head.
