SCP-6762 is a humanoid entity commonly referred to as "The Clown Vet." Her orange stripes and purple lips are highly visible and can be easily identifiable from a distance. She is often observed wearing a bucket hat and has a unique 2 color band on her forehead. Her red clown eyes can be unsettling to some, but her jovial personality quickly puts most at ease.

As a veterinarian, SCP-6762 has an excellent reputation for her ability to communicate with animals, especially those with special needs. Despite her clown-like appearance, she has an uncanny ability to work in a calm and collected manner during emergencies. She is highly respected among her colleagues for her unique ability to connect with creatures of all kinds.

SCP-6762 is an excellent conversationalist and enjoys telling jokes and making others laugh. However, it is common for people to struggle with separating her whimsical personality from her job as a veterinarian. As a result, they often underestimate her skills and abilities in treating animals.

During a routine examination, SCP-6762 was discovered to have an additional set of eyes hidden behind her goggles. It is not known if this is a natural feature or a result of a previous SCP experiment. SCP-6762 also has a peculiar habit of smoking cigarettes while administering treatments, which is highly discouraged but has no bearing on her proficiency as a veterinarian.

SCP-6762's playful nature and affinity for laughter might lead some to believe her to be unprofessional or unfit for her job, but her record speaks to the contrary. She is one of the most talented and respected veterinarians among the SCP foundation staff, and she continues to provide invaluable services to our anomalous animal population.
