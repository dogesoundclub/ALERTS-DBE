Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8458 is to be observed at all times while on the premises of the theater. Any suspicious behavior must be reported to the Foundation immediately. Under no circumstances is the subject allowed to interact with the general public or to distribute any candy sticks outside of the theater.

Description: Subject 8458 is a human male, roughly 40 years old, with unusual facial features. The subject bears a prominent mouth spot and clownish mouth, which he accentuates with a red and white striped candy stick. His eyes are a bright shade of red and are reminiscent of a clown's. His hair is worn in a peak spike, and he often wears a gold chain to complement his eccentric look.

Subject 8458 is the manager of a local theater, and his love for the performing arts is evident in everything he does. He is a master of organization, always planning ahead and making sure that every detail is taken care of. However, he also has a spontaneous side, which can sometimes lead to hilariously unexpected situations.

In addition to his day job, Subject 8458 also enjoys throwing impromptu parties, often surprising his friends with spur-of-the-moment adventures. While his intentions are usually innocent, his love for candy and the playful nature of his personality can sometimes get him into trouble.

Despite his eccentricities, Subject 8458 is generally well-liked by those who know him. However, the Foundation remains vigilant in its efforts to contain him, given his unusual physical appearance and tendency to engage in spontaneous behavior.
