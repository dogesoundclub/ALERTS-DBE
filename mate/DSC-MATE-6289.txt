SCP-6289, designated as a Traffic Officer, is a human female with striking features that make her stand out from the crowd. Her purple lips and orange eyebrows draw the eye, while her head is a metallic blue hue that further sets her apart. The individual is known for wearing a red cross earring on one of her ears, but it is her normal gas mask that truly lends her an air of mystery.

Personality-wise, SCP-6289 is a stickler for details. They are obsessively detail-oriented, going to great lengths to ensure that everything is just so. This tendency can manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet. In some situations, they may even become fixated on small, insignificant details, to the detriment of their overall task.

Potential SCP-6289's obsession with order and detail may make them well-suited to their job as a traffic officer. They would strive for perfection and leave no stone unturned in their efforts to ensure that the flow of traffic is optimal. Nonetheless, their quirks and oddities could prove to be a hindrance in other situations. As such, researchers are advised to approach SCP-6289 with caution and to note any significant deviations from expected behaviour.
