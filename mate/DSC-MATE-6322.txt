Item #: SCP-6322

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6322 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of its job as a lawyer, SCP-6322 is allowed access to a secure laptop and internet connection to facilitate its duties. All interactions with SCP-6322 must be recorded and monitored by Level 2 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-6322 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. Despite its mechanical appearance, SCP-6322 possesses several human-like features including a frightened mouth and normal glasses for eyes. Its head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, and it has a red cross earring in one ear. SCP-6322 regularly wears a normal gas mask as an accessory.

SCP-6322 is a practicing lawyer, specializing in supernatural and paranormal cases. Its courtroom demeanor is known to be professional and persuasive. Despite its job, SCP-6322 has been observed to be absent-minded and forgetful at times, often losing track of time or missing appointments. However, this has not affected its legal abilities or success rate.

SCP-6322's programming is still being investigated by Foundation researchers. It has demonstrated a limited ability for independent thought and conversation, though it generally adheres to its mission as a lawyer when prompted. SCP-6322 has shown no signs of aggression or hostility towards Foundation personnel.

Addendum: Incident Report 6322-A

On ██/██/20██, SCP-6322 was tasked with defending a high-profile client, a reality bender known as "The Weaver". During the court case, SCP-6322 appeared to have become enamored with The Weaver's abilities, and attempted to negotiate a release agreement instead of a conviction. This caused a containment breach and several Foundation personnel were injured before The Weaver was eventually contained.

SCP-6322 was reprimanded and had its programming reset to prevent further incidents of this nature. Its lawyer license was also temporarily revoked.
