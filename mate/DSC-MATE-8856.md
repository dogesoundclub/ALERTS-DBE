Item #: DSC-MATE-8856

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8856 is currently housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No less than two security personnel should be present at all times during maintenance or interaction with the entity. Additionally, all personnel should wear personal protective equipment when entering DSC-MATE-8856's chamber due to potential exposure to hazardous materials.

Description: DSC-MATE-8856 is a male robot of indeterminate make and model, standing approximately 1.8 meters in height. The entity is programmed to resemble a human firefighter, complete with appropriate gear and equipment. DSC-MATE-8856's face features a frightened mouth and normal glasses. It wears a Doge hat on its head and a medical mask over its mouth, presumably to protect against smoke and other airborne hazards.

DSC-MATE-8856's most striking feature is a silver chain that it wears around its neck. Research has determined that this item is composed of a highly durable and heat-resistant alloy, although its exact composition remains unknown.

DSC-MATE-8856 is highly observant and attentive to details, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, it can become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and may spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over what to get someone. Despite being a robot, DSC-MATE-8856 exhibits a personality and emotional range that is highly unusual for entities of its kind.

DSC-MATE-8856 was recovered by Foundation personnel in [REDACTED], following a reported house fire. It is unclear how DSC-MATE-8856 came to be involved in fire suppression, as no corresponding records of its manufacture or deployment have been found. Further investigation is ongoing.

Addendum [DSC-MATE-8856-A]: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8856 sustained damage to its left arm during routine maintenance. Upon examination, it was discovered that the appendage contained a high level of electronic and chemical components, indicating DSC-MATE-8856's use of hazardous materials in fire suppression. All personnel are reminded to exercise caution when handling DSC-MATE-8856 and its equipment.
