Item #: SCP-4911

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-4911 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to SCP-4911's ability to effortlessly shift between forms, it is recommended that at least one guard be present at all times to monitor the cell's surveillance systems.

Description:

SCP-4911 is a male fashion designer of the species Panthera Tigris (Tiger). Its appearance is that of a humanoid tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. SCP-4911 possesses blue clown eyes, which radiate a peculiar gleam.

SCP-4911 is often seen wearing a large black hoodie, which it has identified as its "lucky hoodie." The hoodie is adorned with a two-color band on the forehead, which it claims is a symbol of its tiger clan.

Attached to the hoodie is a gold chain, which SCP-4911 has admitted to using as a tool to distract individuals who it wishes to ambush. A combative, ambitious personality may also be inferred, but this is not displayed in its demeanor.

SCP-4911 is unusually gifted in humor and comedy, and delights in making others laugh. It often creates humorous clothing designs, which it hopes will bring joy to others.

SCP-4911's anomalous abilities are still being studied. It is able to spontaneously change its physical form, even down to microscopic details, within seconds. It has also demonstrated the ability to mimic voices and sounds, and can use this ability with its humor.

Addendum:

SCP-4911's humorous nature has been a source of comfort for many individuals in the Foundation community. Its humorous stories and silly impersonations have been used to lighten the mood in even the most tense of situations. SCP-4911 is encouraged to continue using its humor to help those around it, within the confines of its containment.
