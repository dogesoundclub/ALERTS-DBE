Item #: 2968

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2968 is a human veterinarian with known empathic abilities towards all living creatures. They have been granted unrestricted access to all veterinary facilities and are to report any unusual medical cases immediately to Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 2968 appears to be a Caucasian female in her mid-30s with vivid orange stripes running down her cheeks in a feline-like pattern. She has a bright red lip and smoldering orange eyes under delicate eyebrows. Their 90s brown hair is typically worn in a braid or ponytail with a jade earring on one or both ears. They frequently wear a black choker and often have a white medical mask on their person as a precaution when handling sick animals.

Personality-wise, Subject 2968 displays a deeply nurturing and compassionate nature when it comes to animals in their care. They have been known to coddle and fuss over their patients to an unusual degree, often voicing their medical treatments as if one were dealing with a beloved pet at home. Occasionally, this trait can transfer over to humans in their personal lives, much to the amusement of their loved ones.

Addendum: Subject 2968's aversion to witnessing animal harm or death has not gone unnoticed by Foundation personnel. Any instances of suspected animal cruelty are to be kept away from their attention to prevent any undue emotional distress. It is recommended that Subject 2968 undergo therapy sessions to develop appropriate coping mechanisms for confronting perilous situations that occur with DSCs.
