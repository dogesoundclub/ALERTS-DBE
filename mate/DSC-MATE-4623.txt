Item #: 4623

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: Item #4623 is no longer of concern to the Foundation.

Description: Item #4623 was a male human of average height and weight, with a unique set of facial features. The individual possessed spotted skin and a constant, friendly smile on their face. Their eyes were obscured by ski goggles, and they often wore a police cap to complete their outfit. A green cross earring adorned one of their ears, and they frequently wore a red scarf as an accessory.

Personality-wise, Item #4623 had a tendency to act impulsively and take risks without much forethought. This could lead to humorous and dangerous situations alike, such as jumping off a cliff into a body of water without a second thought. Despite this, Item #4623 was highly regarded in their profession as a veterinarian, often going above and beyond to care for animals in need.

Addendum: Following a containment breach, Item #4623 was exposed to a potent magical artifact, radically altering their DNA and granting them a variety of supernatural abilities. Upon regaining control, Item #4623 voluntarily underwent amnestic treatment and surrendered themselves to Foundation custody. After a thorough debriefing and assessment period, Item #4623 was neutralized, and their identity expunged from all public and private records.
