SCP-1115 is a real estate agent of unknown origins, bearing unique physical features that do not fit its species description. Comprising of a male rabbit's body with a blue bandanaed head, the subject presents a pair of blue clown eyes that command attention wherever it goes. Its mandibles are stuck in a permanent frightened expression that is both unnerving and charming. Its jade earring is a notable feature that could hold anomalous properties, but more research is needed to confirm this.

SCP-1115's personality is flamboyant and extroverted, and it thrives on being the center of attention. It displays an affinity for cracking jokes and telling stories that can only be described as bizarre and hilarious at the same time. The subject's ability to break the ice in social situations is invaluable in events where conversation starters are essential. 

Approach SCP-1115 at your own discretion, as it has been known to charm and persuade even the most skeptical of individuals. Caution should be taken not to disclose sensitive information, as it is unclear if the rabbit has ulterior motives in its line of work. Further observations are necessary to determine if it poses a threat to the public.
