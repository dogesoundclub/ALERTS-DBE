Item #: DSC-MATE-7968

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7968 is to be kept in its designated containment chamber at all times. All interactions with DSC-MATE-7968 are to be conducted through a remote communication system to prevent any accidental activation of its anomalous properties. In the event of DSC-MATE-7968 escaping containment, all personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and await further instructions.

Description: DSC-MATE-7968 appears to be a typical human male in his mid-thirties, standing at 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 85 kilograms. It is a real estate agent by profession, but possesses anomalous traits that make it unsuitable for regular human interaction.

DSC-MATE-7968's appearance is characterised by a large, black spot on the upper right side of its mouth, and a permanently frightened expression on its lips. Its eyes are bright blue in colour, resembling those of a clown, and are often described as 'unnerving'. DSC-MATE-7968 also wears a green cross earring in its left ear, and a red scarf as its accessory.

DSC-MATE-7968's anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with any printed or recorded media. Its thirst for knowledge makes it insatiably curious, and it gains an unprecedented level of comprehension when it is exposed to new information. DSC-MATE-7968 is able to recall information it has learned with perfect accuracy, and is able to interpret and apply it in ways that are beyond human capabilities.

DSC-MATE-7968's desire for knowledge extends to any individual it comes into contact with, and it often attempts to engage in conversation, to share what it has learned. However, this compulsion to share knowledge borders on obsession, and DSC-MATE-7968 often disregards social cues and boundaries in its pursuit of spreading information. This makes it incredibly difficult to contain, as it will attempt to break out of captivity to share its knowledge.

Addendum: O5 Council has recommended that DSC-MATE-7968's anomalous properties be studied further to see if they can be replicated in a controlled manner for use by Foundation personnel. However, given the potential risks associated with its compulsion to share knowledge, further research has been deemed too risky at this stage.
