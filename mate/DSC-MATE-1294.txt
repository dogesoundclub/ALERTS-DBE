Item #: SCP-1294

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1294 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19. However, due to SCP-1294's profession and the potential risks associated with altering legal records, it is permitted to interact with the outside world under strict supervision. SCP-1294's requests for office supplies are to be handled on a case-by-case basis by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1294 is a human male in his late thirties, standing at 1.82 meters tall and weighing approximately 81 kilograms. SCP-1294 has numerous spots on his face and displays the tendency to bite his lower lip when anxious or frightened. He wears a pair of thick, black nerd glasses and has a prominent gold chain draped around his neck, which he often fidgets with. Additionally, SCP-1294's head features a mohawk, which he claims is a "nostalgic throwback" to his teenage years.

SCP-1294's personality is best described as caring and nurturing, leading to an unusual but harmless habit of treating friends and family members as if they were his children. However, SCP-1294's desire to help others can occasionally cause issues, as he has been known to intervene in matters that do not concern him.

SCP-1294's job as a lawyer has not been affected by his anomalous properties; however, his colleagues and clients describe him as "eccentric" and "quirky." SCP-1294 is known to frequently smoke cigarettes during breaks when lodged in detailed legal proceedings.

SCP-1294's anomalous properties are currently believed to be harmless, and any potential long-term effects of his protective behavior are being monitored by Foundation medical staff.

Addendum: On 05/04/20██, SCP-1294 petitioned the Foundation to represent them in their legal battle against a former client. The Director of Site-19 agreed to permit SCP-1294 to act as their own defense, as it posed no immediate risk to the Foundation or the public. SCP-1294 ultimately won the case, leading to widespread media attention and further requests for SCP-1294's legal services from witnesses. These requests were denied.
