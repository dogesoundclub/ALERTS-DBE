Item #: SCP-5612

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5612 is to be kept in a modified humanoid containment cell equipped with a jungle gym and various playthings to allow for physical exercise and stimulation. Its diet consists mainly of fruit and vegetables and must be provided with chewing gum to alleviate stress or boredom. SCP-5612 must be regularly checked for any signs of smoking and returned to confinement if found in possession of cigarettes. Interaction with SCP-5612 is permitted but monitored and must be approved by Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-5612 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca with red clown-like eyes and a red beanie on its head. It stands at approximately 1 meter in height and is capable of performing human-like activities such as driving a vehicle, writing, and operating machinery. SCP-5612 also possesses the ability to speak in broken English.

SCP-5612 has a natural charm and charisma, often endearing it to humans it encounters. It has been observed telling jokes and performing silly dances to entertain those around it. However, it has also displayed a mischievous streak and been noted to steal small items such as pens, keys, and jewelry. It has also been noted to smoke cigarettes, which can lead to health complications.

Addendum: SCP-5612’s origins remain unknown, but it was recovered in the city of ██████ where it was working as a delivery driver. It is believed to have gained its human-like abilities through anomalous means. Its natural mannerisms and charm have led to requests for a possible transfer to the Safe class, but due to its mischievous nature and potential danger, it has been deemed a Euclid class SCP.
