Item #: SCP-845

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-845 is to be contained within a rural area no less than 10 kilometers away from any urban population. The subject's property must be monitored 24/7 by no less than three armed guards at any given time to prevent unauthorized entry.

SCP-845 is allowed to maintain a small farm within his containment area, with limited access to livestock and crops. Any animal or crop products produced by SCP-845 must first be screened and approved by a Level 4 Researcher.

Description: SCP-845 is a male human, approximately 55 years old, with two distinct physical features. The first being spots scattered across his face, and the second being his clown mouth. SCP-845's eyes are a bright red, which appears to be due to cosmetic contact lenses.

SCP-845 wears a purple cap with a headset, a jade earring in each ear, and a silver chain around his neck. He also frequently carries a candy stick with him, which he will often offer to others. SCP-845's anomalous effect causes people in his presence to become increasingly open and friendly towards him, sharing personal information and even laughing at his jokes, though the reason for this is currently unknown.

SCP-845 has displayed a charismatic yet eccentric personality, often telling amusing stories and engaging in friendly banter with others. His charm and ability to connect with others can lead to humorous situations, including people becoming more relaxed and open around him than they otherwise would.

Addendum: Experiment Log 845-1

Subject: D-845-01, a male with no prior knowledge of the SCP Foundation or SCP-845.

Procedure: SCP-845 was allowed to engage in a conversation with D-845-01, with the intention of getting him to reveal classified information about the SCP Foundation.

Results: SCP-845 was able to manipulate D-845-01 into revealing his security clearance levels, locations of other SCP containment sites, and personal information. SCP-845 was able to maintain this effect on D-845-01 for approximately 20 minutes. The findings highlight a serious threat posed by SCP-845, as he is capable of coercing information from even highly trained personnel.

Due to the level of information obtained by SCP-845, it is strongly recommended that further testing be undertaken with extreme caution.
