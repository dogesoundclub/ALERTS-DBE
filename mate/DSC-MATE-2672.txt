Item #: 2672

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2672 is to be monitored at all times via closed circuit video feed. Physical interaction with SCP-2672 by Foundation personnel is strictly prohibited. SCP-2672's location is to remain unknown to the general public at all times.

Description: SCP-2672, also known as "The Politician," appears physically as a human male with a frightened mouth and eyes that resemble ski goggles. SCP-2672 possesses green hair and wears a purple cap, a green cross earring, a silver chain, and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-2672 is a highly intelligent and curious individual, with a thirst for knowledge and an insatiable desire to learn. He spends vast amounts of time reading, researching and collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials. SCP-2672 often shares his newfound knowledge with others in a passionate, almost aggressive manner.

SCP-2672's political position provides him with access to confidential information, which he often uses to further his knowledge and research, sometimes at the expense of his colleagues.

SCP-2672's origins and the extent of his abilities remain unknown to the Foundation, making containment and neutralization difficult. SCP-2672's knowledge and inquisitive nature give him the potential to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, but also pose significant risks if left unchecked.
