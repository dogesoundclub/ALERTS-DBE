Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-153 is to be kept in a climate-controlled, reinforced steel containment chamber at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-153 is a highly advanced robot designed to look and function like a human male. Its face features a frightened expression in its mouth and its eyes are equipped with VR jade LED technology. The head is outfitted with a headset containing LED lights, which often change colors based on DSC-MATE-153's emotional state. 

DSC-MATE-153's most notable accessory is a gold chain worn around its neck. The chain serves no functional purpose and appears to be purely for decoration. 

DSC-MATE-153 exhibits human-like emotions that can be influenced by external stimuli such as movies, TV shows, and music. It has an uncanny ability to evoke strong feelings of emotion, often becoming moved to tears by sentimental moments or displaying affection towards artistic creations. 

DSC-MATE-153's primary job is that of a politician, using its emotionally aware programming to sway public opinion and gain support. However, its increasingly unpredictable emotional states present a potential threat to the general public. DSC-MATE-153's containment chamber is lined with soundproofing material to minimize the chances of its emotional states affecting nearby individuals. 

Further research into DSC-MATE-153's abilities is ongoing. Despite its current designation as Euclid, its potential capabilities indicate that it may require further classification. 

DogeSoundClub personnel are advised to treat DSC-MATE-153 with caution and respect, and must adhere to all established containment procedures at all times.
