The subject designated as 223 is a female human who possesses a unique set of physical characteristics bordering on the anomalous. A series of unusual spots and a striking purple lip distinguishes her facial features, while her orange eyebrow invokes intrigue and unease. Her head displays retro aesthetics reminiscent of the 00s school girl archetype while sporting a pair of jade earrings. A gold chain adorns the subject's neck as her only accessory. 

223 is a highly intelligent individual who works as a programmer, a job that necessitates a sharp mind and rigorous attention to detail. She's deeply curious about the world around her and actively seeks out obscure or unusual topics to learn about, which often results in humorous moments where she'll recite random facts and trivia to those within earshot. Her pursuit of knowledge, coupled with her unique physical characteristics, makes her an unknown entity within the SCP community. Exercise caution when approaching 223, as her seemingly benign capabilities suggest far more potent abilities that remain undiscovered.
