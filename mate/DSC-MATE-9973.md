Item #: 9973

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 9973 is to be treated like any other humanoid object and is to be given unrestricted access to its device. The collar around its neck is to be checked monthly and replaced immediately if found to have loosened.

Description: Officer 9973 is a male rabbit with blue clown eyes and not arranged green surmounted by a goggle on its forehead, with a gold earring on each ear, and a gold chain around its neck. At all times, Officer 9973 has exhibited a nurturing personality, often going the extra mile for his colleagues and friends, with behaviors that can seem overprotective and manifest as parental concern.

The origin of Officer 9973 is unknown, and it is speculated that the first imprints started during his early years. The mechanisms behind these abilities remain unexplained, with no signs of magic or extraordinary abilities. However, Officer 9973 has demonstrated a surprising propensity towards understanding people intuitively, with an exceptional talent for recognizing the patterns of thought and emotions of others.

Officer 9973 poses some risks to its colleagues, as its parenting instincts have been the subject of alarming attention, frequently leading to misinterpretations of proper professional behavior. Nevertheless, it is still regarded as a valuable asset for its capacity to mend social relations and foster interpersonal collaborations.

Addendum 9973-A: During an incident on ██/██/20██, Officer 9973 was affected by [REDACTED] that resulted in ████ and ███████ to begin to form as sporadic patterns across its body. It is unclear how this has changed Officer 9973's abilities, if at all. Close examination and experimentation of this anomaly's properties are under consideration.
