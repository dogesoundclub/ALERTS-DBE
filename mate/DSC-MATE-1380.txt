Item #: SCP-1380

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1380 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to its position as theater manager, SCP-1380 is permitted to interact with Foundation personnel in a professional capacity only. Any attempts by SCP-1380 to deviate from approved communication channels will result in immediate termination of privileges.

Description: SCP-1380 appears to be a humanoid robot resembling a middle-aged man. The facial features consist of a frightened mouth and horned rim glasses, with a police cap as its headpiece. SCP-1380's programming allows it to display a great deal of charisma, making it quite effective in social situations. However, SCP-1380 shows no signs of advanced intelligence, and is unable to deviate from its programmed duties.

SCP-1380 serves as the manager of an urban theater, utilizing its social abilities to create camaraderie among the patrons. While no formal explanation has been found for the presence of SCP-1380, it has been observed that the theater is very popular, with notable ticket sales for all events.

Addendum: Dr. ███████ has recommended that the theater be monitored for possible anomalous activity. While SCP-1380 has shown no signs of deviating from its programming, its ability to connect with others on a deep level could allow it to manipulate them to some degree. Investigation into the theater's management practices is ongoing.
