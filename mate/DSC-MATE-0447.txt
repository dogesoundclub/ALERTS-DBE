Item #: SCP-447

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-447 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Daily check-ins with the on-site medical staff are required to monitor the health and wellbeing of SCP-447. Any attempts by SCP-447 to take control of Foundation operations must be stopped immediately, as she has shown a natural talent for leadership and manipulation.

Description: SCP-447 is a female human doctor with distinct physical features including orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Her eyes are red clown eyes, and she has 90s brown hair and a green cross earring. She can often be found wearing a silver chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-447 has a natural talent for taking charge and can often manipulate situations to her advantage. This personality trait is evident in all aspects of her life, including work, social groups, and personal relationships. Foundation personnel should be aware of her tendencies towards leadership and ensure that situations are handled in a way that does not allow SCP-447 to take control.

SCP-447's medical expertise and knowledge of the human body make her a valuable asset to the Foundation, but her manipulative tendencies must be monitored to ensure the safety of personnel and the continued success of Foundation operations.
