Subject 9894, codename "Tiger Blaze", is a highly trained firefighter and member of our urban fantasy task force. This magnificent creature is a male tiger, standing tall and strong at six feet and two inches. In his line of work, he is known to be fearless, even in the face of the most terrifying infernos.

The first noticeable feature of 9894 is his striking set of nerd glasses, which he wears atop his fierce amber-colored eyes. They give him a look of intelligence, which is well-matched with his on-the-job expertise as a first responder.

To complement his glasses, he dons a black hoodie that covers his shoulders and torso. A two-color band adorns his forehead, adding a touch of style to his everyday attire. His mouth is always concealed behind a medical mask, which is a necessity for his line of work.

Despite the serious nature of his work, Tiger Blaze has a humorous and witty personality. He enjoys making others laugh and often tells funny stories and silly jokes to lighten the mood. This quality makes him well-liked by his peers and helps him manage the stresses that come with the job.

Tiger Blaze is an asset to our team, and his unique set of skills has saved countless lives from the fires that ravage our city. He is a true hero, and we are grateful for his unwavering bravery and unwavering sense of humor.
