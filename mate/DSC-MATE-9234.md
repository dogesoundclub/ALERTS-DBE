DSC-MATE-9234, also known as "The Electrician", is a humanoid creature of presumed human origin. Her striking appearance is marked by spots on her face and purple lips, but it is her head of green hair with a distinct edge curl and cross earring that unmistakably identify her. DSC-MATE-9234's seemingly normal glasses negate the need for further humanoid classification.

It is imperative to note that DSC-MATE-9234 carries out the responsibilities of an electrician with a vigilance that borders on the obsessive. This diligence permeates her personality, which can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating to those who interact with her. However, this behavior arises from her intense desire to get things done efficiently and effectively. To her, precision is paramount when it comes to electrical systems, and any slacking off in this arena is unacceptable.

DSC-MATE-9234's human origin remains a mystery, and it is unclear how or when she acquired her anomalous abilities. It is advisable for Foundation personnel to approach DSC-MATE-9234 with caution, as her strong and decisive presence can often make others feel uneasy.
