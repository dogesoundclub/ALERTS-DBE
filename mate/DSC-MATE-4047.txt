Description: 

4047 is a female human with various physical traits that make her stand out from the crowd. She possesses multiple spots on her face, and she greets most people with a smile. Her eyes are implausibly red, giving them the appearance of clown eyes, and she usually wears a blonde ushanka with a set of jade earrings in her ears. Additionally, she has recently begun wearing a choker and often indulges in smoking cigarettes. However, these physical attributes are of little concern in comparison to her personality, which is eccentric and humorous.

She possesses an exceptional sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. She has a habit of telling jokes and stories and is always ready to entertain company. Her unique personality makes her an excellent source of entertainment and can quickly liven up challenging situations. 

Despite her antics, 4047 shows a remarkable ability for investigative journalism. She works as a reporter for various tabloids, and her articles are often cited as biting, sarcastic, and sometimes even harsh. Despite her profession, her sense of humor never leaves her, and she often weaves it into her reports in ways that might seem unprofessional to some.

Despite her friendly demeanor, 4047 is not to be trusted. She is unpredictable, and her humorous nature can sometimes lead her to cross ethical boundaries. Her sense of humor extends to her interactions with the containment team, and as such, strict safeguards must be in place in handling her. Any deviation from these procedures may lead to unforeseen consequences.

Addendum: 4047's proclivities for humor led to several incidents in the past where she has found loopholes in containment procedures to make jokes. As such, it is recommended to monitor her communications for any attempts to exploit weaknesses in our security protocols.
