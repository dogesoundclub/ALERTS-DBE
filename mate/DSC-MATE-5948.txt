Item #: 5948

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5948 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access must be granted by two Level 2 personnel and any interaction with SCP-5948 must be supervised. Daily check-ups are to be conducted to ensure the health and well-being of the subject.

Description: SCP-5948 appears as a male rabbit with normal glasses, a retro cap, a gold chain, and a candy stick. Despite its appearance, SCP-5948 possesses human-like intelligence and personality. The subject works as a real estate agent in the ████████ area.

SCP-5948 exhibits a generally laid-back and easy-going demeanor, often attempting to diffuse conflict with humor and wit. However, in situations where loved ones are threatened, SCP-5948 can become fiercely protective and loyal. This behavior has led to humorous situations, such as heated arguments with individuals who insult friends or family members.

SCP-5948's anomalous properties manifest when it is in close proximity to other individuals. Those within approximately five meters of SCP-5948 report feeling inexplicably compelled to trust and cooperate with the subject. This effect does not seem to be limited to humans, as SCP-5948 has been observed working closely with other SCPs.

Addendum: SCP-5948 was encountered by Foundation personnel during an investigation into several anomalous real estate transactions. Upon discovering the subject's anomalous properties, SCP-5948 was taken into Foundation custody without incident. SCP-5948 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, but has expressed a desire to return to its former profession as a real estate agent. Research into possible alternative means of containment and utilization is ongoing.
