Document #: 7043

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of its species, 7043 must be housed in a specially designed containment facility. The chamber must be kept at a constant temperature of 25°C and filled with natural vegetation to simulate its native habitat. Surveillance cameras must be in place to monitor the subject at all times as it has been known to display sudden and uncontrolled outbursts of aggression.

Description: 7043 is a male tiger of the Bengal subspecies. It measures approximately 3 meters in length, weighs 200 kg, and displays a unique set of features that deviate from its "normal" physical traits. Its eyes are equipped with a rainbow-colored LED system, which can display a wide range of colors according to its mood. Additionally, it wears a single cross earring in its left ear and a red scarf around its neck. These items appear to be of sentimental value to the subject.

Personality: Despite its aggressive nature, 7043 displays a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy beyond what is to be expected of an animal. It is capable of understanding and responding appropriately to human language with a level of understanding akin to that of a young child. The subject also has an uncanny ability to detect the moods and emotional states of others, often offering comforting words or humorous takes on difficult circumstances.

Notes: The subject was initially discovered working as a banker in downtown Los Angeles. Its anomalous abilities quickly drew the attention of SCP operatives, leading to its containment in Site-██. Further study is required to fully understand its abilities and how they relate to the anomalous nature of its species.
