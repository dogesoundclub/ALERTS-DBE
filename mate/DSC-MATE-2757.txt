Item #: SCP-2757

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2757 is to be kept within a secure facility at all times. The subject is to be monitored by no less than three (3) armed guards at all times due to the high likelihood of unintentional breaches of containment. In the event of an escape, all persons within a two-kilometer radius are to be evacuated and searched for signs of SCP-2757 activity. SCP-2757 is not to come in contact with any non-D-class personnel under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-2757 is a security guard of average height and build, standing at approximately 5'11". The subject's facial features are notable for its spots, making SCP-2757 stand out in a crowd. The subject's eyes are protected by ski goggles, which are to remain on at all times to minimize the risk of containment breaches. SCP-2757's hair is parted down the middle and dyed pink, further distinguishing it from other human beings.

SCP-2757's personality is characterized by a natural charm and charisma that often results in it being the life of the party. The subject is known to tell jokes, perform silly dances, and engage in other lighthearted activities to entertain those around it. However, SCP-2757's personality can also lead to breaches of containment as it has shown a tendency to become overly friendly with those it encounters, regardless of the level of threat they pose.

SCP-2757's infectious personality has thus far baffled researchers, with some speculating that it may be an anomalous trait. Further experimentation is required to determine the extent of SCP-2757's abilities and potential danger to the Foundation and general public.
