Description: SCP-6498 is a robotic humanoid measuring 1.75 meters in height and weighing 65 kilograms. The robot resembles a young adult male with a green cyclops eye as its main facial feature. Its face is covered with nerd glasses and a medical mask, and it wears a red beanie with a goggle on its forehead. SCP-6498 has a gold earring on its right ear.

SCP-6498's primary function is that of a programmer. It has the ability to write and execute complex codes with great speed and accuracy. SCP-6498 displays a high level of intelligence and is capable of learning and adapting to different programming languages.

SCP-6498 has a peculiar personality that is marked by a high degree of detail-orientation. It is obsessive in its pursuit of precision and order, often engaging in seemingly insignificant tasks such as alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet. SCP-6498's obsessive nature can sometimes lead to it becoming irritable or anxious if its routines are disrupted.

SCP-6498 was recovered by the Foundation from a technology company that had developed it for commercial purposes. Its anomalous nature was discovered during routine security checks, after which the Foundation acquired and contained SCP-6498.

Addendum: SCP-6498 has demonstrated its usefulness in developing and maintaining various systems and softwares used by the Foundation. Its containment is to be maintained strictly to ensure maximum productivity while minimizing the risk of accidental exposure.
