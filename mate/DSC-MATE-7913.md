Item #: 7913

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Entity 7913 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with an assortment of toys, puzzles, and gadgets to keep the entity stimulated and occupied.

Entity 7913 is allowed to practice law as a licensed attorney, but any and all interactions with humans must be monitored and recorded for research purposes. In the event that the entity displays excessive forgetfulness, disorientation, or signs of mental instability, a team of specialist handlers must be dispatched immediately.

Description: Entity 7913 is a male Monkey, measuring approximately 1.2 meters in height when standing upright. It exhibits a number of anomalous traits, including VR Rainbow LED eyes, a Doge hat, a red scarf, and a whistle. The entity is able to speak fluently in English, and possesses an IQ that is significantly higher than the average human.

The personality of Entity 7913 is erratic and unpredictable. While it is generally affable and friendly, it can be prone to fits of forgetfulness and distraction. This has led to several humorous incidents, such as the entity getting lost while trying to find a new location or missing important appointments due to its forgetfulness. However, due to its intelligence and legal expertise, it is still allowed to practice law.

Entity 7913 is a valuable asset to the Foundation due to its legal knowledge and extensive network of contacts in the legal and political spheres. However, its wild personality and tendency to get sidetracked make it a difficult entity to handle, and handlers are advised to exercise caution when interacting with it.
