Item #: SCP-5490

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5490 is to be monitored at all times while on its job as a delivery driver. Any unusual activity or behavior must be reported immediately to the nearest supervising personnel. SCP-5490 must be provided with its daily dose of psylicor, a pill that keeps its anomalous abilities at bay.

SCP-5490 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell during periods of rest.

Description: SCP-5490 is a human female of average height and weight, with orange stripes running from the side of its head down to the corner of its jaw. Its face features an orange eyebrow, a smile, and a goggle on its forehead. Its ears are adorned with a jade earring, and it wears a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-5490 displays an abnormal level of creativity, constantly coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, these ideas are often impractical or downright bizarre, seemingly for the sheer joy of imagining outlandish solutions to everyday problems.

SCP-5490's personality puts it in a constant state of brainstorming, which can make it difficult to focus on tasks at hand. To avoid distractions, SCP-5490 has been confined to the role of a delivery driver, where it can channel its creative energies into the task of finding the most efficient and creative routes to its destinations.

It is also worth noting that SCP-5490 possesses an anomalous ability to manipulate reality, manifesting as small glitches in the environment around it. This ability is most evident when SCP-5490 becomes overly excited or agitated. To control its abilities, SCP-5490 must be administered psylicor on a daily basis.

Addendum: SCP-5490 has displayed a strong aversion to any form of restriction or conformity, indicating a potential for containment breach if not carefully monitored. Efforts to understand the nature of SCP-5490's anomalous abilities are ongoing.
