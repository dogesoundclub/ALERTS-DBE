Item #: SCP-2592

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2592 is to be kept in a specially designed containment chamber with dimensions of at least 4 meters by 4 meters. A live prey is to be delivered to SCP-2592 once every three days, under the supervision of at least two Level 3 personnel. Any personnel entering SCP-2592's containment chamber must wear a medical mask, eye protection, and a sufficient amount of protective gear to prevent accidental bodily harm. SCP-2592 is not to be provoked or agitated under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-2592 is a male tiger, approximately 2 meters in length and weighing 400 kilograms. Its eyesight is corrected with normal glasses, and it wears a doge hat on its head, a jade earring on its left ear, and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-2592 has been recorded to speak fluently in English, but it does not respond well to orders or requests. It has a quirky sense of humor, often making witty observations or teasing its observers in a dry, deadpan manner. SCP-2592 is highly intelligent and analytical, often calculating its every move, but it can become agitated if provoked.

SCP-2592's diet consists of raw meat, preferably live prey, and it has never displayed any interest in plant-based diets. Its metabolism is highly efficient, and it can consume up to 20 kilograms of food in a single day. SCP-2592 has been observed to be lethargic during the day but extremely active at night, which is attributed to its natural instincts as a nocturnal predator.

SCP-2592 was discovered on a small farm in [REDACTED], India, where it had been living as a farmer for unknown amounts of time. Witnesses reported that SCP-2592 was able to operate machinery and perform various farm duties, displaying a high level of skill and efficiency. Its origin is unknown, and it is currently classified as an anomalous sentient entity.

Addendum: Following Incident 2592-A, it has been observed that SCP-2592 has developed an aversion to medical masks, often displaying aggressive behaviors towards any individuals wearing one. Further observation is required to determine the cause of the aversion and its potential long-term effects.
