Item #: SCP-8466

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8466 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Any electrical equipment within its chamber must be inspected and cleared by a certified electrician before use. SCP-8466 is allowed daily access to the facility's electrical workshops for the purpose of maintenance and repair work, supervised by a level 3 researcher.

Description: SCP-8466 is a male human, identified as an electrician by profession. It stands approximately 1.8 meters tall, and has a stocky build with a slightly hunched posture. SCP-8466's most notable features are its red clown eyes, mouth spot, and perpetual smile. It wears a black hoodie with a two-color band on its forehead, along with a medical mask and a red scarf as accessories.

SCP-8466 can be absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time or missing important events. However, this trait does not seem to affect its ability to perform electrical work, which it does with great skill and efficiency. SCP-8466 appears to enjoy its work and takes pride in fixing things.

SCP-8466's red clown eyes have been shown to emit a low level of electromagnetic radiation, which can interfere with nearby electrical equipment. This effect has been observed to cause power outages and glitches in electronic devices up to two meters away from SCP-8466. Due to this anomaly, SCP-8466 is only allowed access to electrical workshops under close supervision.

Addendum: Due to its willingness to work and amicable disposition, SCP-8466 has been granted a recreational room with access to books, music, and art supplies. This has improved its mood and overall demeanor. Researchers are encouraged to interact with SCP-8466 in a friendly and respectful manner, as it has proven to be cooperative and eager to please.
