Item #: SCP-959

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-959 is to be monitored at all times by at least two Level 3 personnel assigned to its containment chamber. It is not to be allowed contact with other SCPs or non-authorized personnel outside of testing protocols. SCP-959's daily routine is to be strictly regimented and adhered to, with any deviations noted and documented by assigned personnel.

Description: SCP-959 is a male human of indeterminate age, identified to have a job as a real estate agent. It possesses unique facial features such as orange stripes on its cheeks and a frightened expression. SCP-959 has blue clown eyes, and sports green hair in a purple cap. Its forehead is adorned with a two-color band and a pair of goggles. It is observed to always carry a candy stick as an accessory.

SCP-959's personality is noteworthy, as it is reported to possess a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. While this can lead to some humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood, personnel are reminded to remain vigilant in their interactions with SCP-959 as it is still classified as Euclid.

SCP-959 was discovered during a routine investigation of a suspected anomalous storefront in ██████████. Foundation agents traced its origin to a small coastal town on the East █████ Sea, where it was transported to Site-██ for further study.

Addendum: Foundation researchers have discovered that SCP-959's candy stick possesses minor anomalous properties, causing any individuals who consume it to enter a state of heightened suggestibility for a period of 24 hours. As such, all candy sticks in SCP-959's possession are to be confiscated and disposed of appropriately.
