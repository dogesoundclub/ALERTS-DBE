Description: Subject 9956 is a human male of average height and build. He possesses a unique facial feature characterized by a dark spot located just above his upper lip, earning him the nicknames "Mouth Spot" and "Mole Man" within the fashion industry. Additionally, his forehead has two distinctive color bands that draw attention to themselves.

Subject 9956 is typically adorned with a gold earring, complementing the fashionable outfits he often wears. His signature accessory, however, is a cigarette that he never seems to be without.

The individual is known for his attention to detail, often displaying somewhat obsessive tendencies. This trait has been noted in several areas of his life, from the meticulously organized color-coding of his closet to the alphabetized arrangement of his spice rack.

Though exhibiting no overt anomalies, the Foundation considers subject 9956 to warrant special attention due to his unique physical characteristics and behavioral tendencies.

Addendum: Recent reports suggest that subject 9956 may have been involved in fashion projects incorporating anomalous materials. Further investigation is necessary to confirm or refute these claims.
