Item #: SCP-2681

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2681 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access is strictly prohibited without prior approval from at least one (1) Level 3 personnel. Any interaction with SCP-2681 must be recorded and analyzed by site personnel.

Description: SCP-2681 appears to be a male rabbit standing at approximately 80 cm at the shoulder from his hind legs. SCP-2681 wears a doge hat on its head, and its forehead has a 2-color band. SCP-2681's ears have a jade earring, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. It also wears an LED gas mask that obscures its face, making it difficult to differentiate its eyes.

SCP-2681 is currently the boss of a mafia group and has acquired vast wealth and power in the criminal underworld. Despite its fearsome reputation, SCP-2681 is notably gentle and nurturing, often referring to its criminal associates as its "family." SCP-2681's caring personality extends to inanimate objects as well, as it has been observed giving names to its cars, anthropomorphizing its household appliances, and talking to its plants.

SCP-2681 has been observed using its abilities to influence individuals through a combination of charisma and subtle mind control. Its ability to manipulate those around it has led to significant concern among the site personnel, who have deemed SCP-2681 to be highly dangerous.

Addendum: Site personnel have reported instances of SCP-2681 referring to itself as "Bugs," suggesting that this may be its chosen name. Further research is required to determine the significance of this information.
