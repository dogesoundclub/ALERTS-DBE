Description: Subject 4155, known by the civilian alias [REDACTED], is a male human of no significant paranormal ability. Their appearance is of note, with two distinct facial features that can be used for identification purposes. Firstly, the subject has a distinctive Mouth Spot, measuring approximately .5 cm by .5 cm, located on the left side of their lower lip. This is a natural pigmentation and is otherwise unremarkable. Secondly, the subject's Smile, when displayed, exhibits a high level of curvature, often considered exaggerated by observers. The subject's lips part to such an extent that their teeth are visible, further accentuating the Smile. Subjects frequently report a feeling of unease when viewing this Smile, and some have even experienced memetic infection from it.
