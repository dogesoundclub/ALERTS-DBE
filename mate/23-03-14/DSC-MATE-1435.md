ID # : DSC-MATE-1435
Description: DSC-MATE-1435 is a human male, appearing to be in his late 20s to early 30s, with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth. Its blue clown eyes and a red victory band on its forehead give it a unique and unsettling appearance. DSC-MATE-1435 has blond hair and sports a goggle on its forehead. An examination shows that the goggles contain no lenses or any other functioning parts. Additionally, it wears a jade earring on its left ear and a gold chain around its neck, both of which seem to have no anomalous properties.
