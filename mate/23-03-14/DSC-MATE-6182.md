Description: The Salesman, as he has come to be known, is a male of average height with a vibrant smile always plastered on his face. It's said that his sales pitch can charm even the most skeptical listener. He bears the appearance of a typical used car salesman, wearing a purple cap adorned with a headset and jade earrings that glint in the light. The most striking feature of subject 6182 is his unusual red clown eyes that never seem to dim, even in the dark. The Salesman may always be seen with his normal gas mask as well as a silver chain around his neck.
