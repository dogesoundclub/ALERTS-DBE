ID # : DSC-MATE-2778
Description: Object 2778 is a humanoid robot with green hair, a single glowing green cyclops eye, and a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. It wears a purple cap and red scarf, and has a goggle on its forehead. The entity exhibits a personality that is both outgoing and social, often preferring to be the center of attention. Its emotional range is limited and occasionally inappropriate, as if it were programmed to be ironic or sarcastic. It is unclear to what extent 2778 is biologically sentient, as its main purpose is assumed to be a tool for financial analysis, but there are times where distinct signs of self-awareness are noticeable.
