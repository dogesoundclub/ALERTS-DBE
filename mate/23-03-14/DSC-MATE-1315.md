Description: Item 1315 appears to be a humanoid robot with a single green cyclops eye that glows menacingly. Its eyes flicker and pulse with a VR rainbow LED pattern, while the robot's ears are adorned with a jade earring. The robot is fond of wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle around its neck. Its metallic body is approximately six feet tall, and it emits a faint humming noise when not in use. The robot's AI is highly advanced and can communicate in several languages, though it tends to speak with an ominous and threatening tone.
