ID # : DSC-MATE-8419
Description: Subject 8419 is a male tiger of the species Pantera Tigris with a frightened mouth expression that appears when exposed to loud noises or sudden movements. The VR Rainbow LED eyes appear to provide enhanced visual capabilities with a frequency range outside of normal human vision. The head is not arranged in green, possibly indicating signs of stress caused by the subject’s captivity. The subject wears a Jade Earring, which is considered both arcane and fascinating by researchers. A medical mask always covers the 8419’s mouth, potentially due to a contagious condition and as a safety measure.
