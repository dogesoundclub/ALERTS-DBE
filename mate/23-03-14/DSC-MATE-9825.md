ID # : DSC-MATE-9825
Description: 9825 is a male rabbit species, standing at approximately 3 feet tall. Its body weight and features are mostly consistent with that of a regular rabbit, save for the distinguishing accessories it habitually wears. 9825 sports a stylish bucket hat that blends seamlessly with its fur, adorned with a gold earring on its left ear. Its eyes are covered by horn-rimmed glasses, which offer no tell-tale sign of any peculiarity within its body. Finally, the rabbit politician carries a large candy stick - the attribute acting both as an accessory and a quirk.
