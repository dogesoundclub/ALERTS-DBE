Description: Subject 2060 appears to be a female human of average height with normal glasses. However, hidden beneath the pink rabbit head which covers the entirety of her face, renders her with a startlingly distinctive appearance. Her forehead features a two-color band which serves no discernible purpose other than decoration. The subject's ears hold a Red Cross Earring that is believed to be self-applied. She continually wears a medical mask to cover her mouth, further intensifying the mysterious persona of subject 2060. Her favorite accessory is a black choker, which she is usually seen wearing at all times.
