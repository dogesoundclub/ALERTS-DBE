Description: Subject 8878 appears to be a male human with typical male features. However, they have a distinctive trait that sets them apart: their eyes are a VR rainbow LED. This is believed to be the result of an experimental procedure carried out by an unknown party prior to their discovery by the Foundation. Their hair is unremarkable save for the fact that it is blonde in a normal style for a man.
