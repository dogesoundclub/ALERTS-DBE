ID # : DSC-MATE-8787
Description: Subject 8787 is a male human of average height and build, sporting a peculiar combination of physical features. Most strikingly, the subject's mouth bears a dark spot resembling a birthmark, possibly indicating a genetic abnormality. The subject's eyes are covered by a pair of ski goggles at all times, negating any attempt at visual identification. The subject's head is also noteworthy, as it appears to be entirely made of a metallic, purple material. Similarly strange are the subject's ears, pierced with a pair of green cross earrings. The subject regularly wears a medical mask covering the lower half of their face, ostensibly for health reasons. Finally, the subject is never seen without a thick gold chain around their neck.
