Description: Subject 3455 is a female human with a comically infectious smile that can disarm even the most hardened of individuals. She is marked with various spots on her face, reminiscent of a wild animal, but her eyes are what set her apart: they are a bright orange color with eyebrow-shaped markings above them.
