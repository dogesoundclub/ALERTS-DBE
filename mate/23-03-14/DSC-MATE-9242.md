ID # : DSC-MATE-9242
Description: 9242 is a male tiger of unknown origin that possesses various anomalous features. The subject is employed as a delivery driver and their regular interactions with humans have been documented without suspicion. Their unique physical appearance includes a pair of horned rim glasses for their eyes, a bucket hat worn on their head, and a two-color band prominently displayed on their forehead. A goggle is also present on the forehead. The individual sports a red cross earring in each ear and typically wears a gold chain. Most unusual, however, is their frequently worn LED gas mask accessory. It is unknown if this device serves any functional purpose or if it is strictly for aesthetic reasons.
