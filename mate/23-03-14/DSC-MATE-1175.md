Description: Item 1175 appears to be a humanoid robot outfitted with a bucket hat and jade earring. The robot is programmed to work as a programmer and is highly skilled in software development. Item 1175 is able to observe and analyze details with remarkable attention, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, this attention to detail often becomes a hindrance as they become overly concerned with providing the "perfect" gift for someone, leading to excessive amounts of time spent in preparation.
