Description: Subject 8871 is a male rabbit of abnormal size and reddish fur. Their most notable feature is a pair of red clown eyes that are often mistaken for an exotic ocular condition. The subject's head is not arranged in the typical fashion for a rabbit, but rather appears as if someone has taken a toy and glued various pieces together.
