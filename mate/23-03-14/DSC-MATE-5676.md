ID # : DSC-MATE-5676
Description: Item #5676 appears to be a human male with a distinctive mohawk hairstyle and normal glasses. The subject is often seen sporting a jade earring on one of his ears. Despite his seemingly intimidating appearance, the subject exhibits an unusual personality trait that sets him apart from typical mafia bosses. He is known to be highly caring and nurturing, often extending it towards inanimate objects such as his car or household appliances. This has led many to speculate that the subject may possess some level of anomalous ability, although no evidence of such has been recorded.
