Description: Subject is a female human identified as the leader of a well-known criminal organization. Her appearance is highly distinctive, with orange eyebrows, a tiara affixed to her head, and a red cross earring on each ear. She also wears a choker around her neck as an additional accessory. Despite her appearance, subject should not be underestimated; her analytical mind and logical approach to problem-solving make her a formidable foe. However, she does possess a quirky sense of humor, and may use it to make witty observations or tease others in a dry and deadpan manner.
