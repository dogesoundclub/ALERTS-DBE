ID # : DSC-MATE-4397
Description: Subject 4397 is a male tiger species, capable of transforming into a humanoid form with a lithe and agile build. The subject displays unique features, including ski goggle eyes, a purple cap with a headset, and a pair of jade earrings on its feline ears. Subject 4397 is often seen wearing a gold chain and indulges in the use of cigarettes, a habit thought to have been picked up during its human persona's time as a lawyer. The hybrid has a unique, playful personality that can come across as scatterbrained at times. This occasional forgetfulness or tendency to get sidetracked can lead to humorous encounters, but care should be taken to minimize risks and avoid potential conflicts.
