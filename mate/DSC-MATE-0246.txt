Item #: 246

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are advised to approach 246 with caution, but without fear. The subject is to be treated with respect and empathy, as aggressive or hostile behavior has never been observed. It is currently assigned as a Traffic Officer on the outskirts of ████████. 246 should always wear its designated red scarf, as it is an intricate part of its identity.

Description: 246 is a human male, approximately 5'8" tall, wearing a hoodie along with a red scarf. Its most defining feature is the presence of a brown spot on the upper right corner of his mouth. Additionally, it wears red contact lenses, giving the impression of clown-like eyes. Under no circumstances should personnel attempt to remove the hoodie or scarf, as it is a crucial aspect of his Persona, and observing the face feature without preparation can lead to severe psychological effects.

246 is very empathetic and compassionate, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. It has a strong desire to help others and will often take onboard the problems of the people they meet. Occasionally this mentality leaves 246 better equipped to handle supernatural phenomena or diffusing tension that arises from anomalous situations. The subject is still human, and personnel should be aware that it is also vulnerable to the dangers of the job.

Addendum: 246 has exhibited no signs of any other supernatural ability, although caution should still be taken when interacting with it. Interacting with 246 may provoke a strong compulsion in the observer to share intimate details of their life, and while self-exploration and honesty may be healthy, confidentiality protocols remain in place for a reason. Personnel assigned to work with 246 should be trained in both emotional personnel management and confidentiality measures.
