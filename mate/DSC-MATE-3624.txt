Addendum: Incident 3624-Alpha

On ██/██/20██, SCP-3624's personal belongings were not adequately cataloged, and it was discovered that SCP-3624 had a concealed firearm within its jacket pocket. Upon interrogation, SCP-3624 claimed the weapon was for self-defense purposes, but it was decided that its possession of such an item is a breach of containment protocol. All personal belongings are now subject to regular checks, and SCP-3624 is monitored closely.
