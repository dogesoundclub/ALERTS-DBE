Item #: SCP-9399

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel assigned to the containment and surveillance of SCP-9399 must undergo mandatory physical and psychological screenings. Under no circumstances are any unauthorized individuals allowed into SCP-9399's theater. SCP-9399's access to candy sticks must be limited to prevent overconsumption. Any incidents involving SCP-9399 must be immediately reported to supervising personnel.

Description: SCP-9399 appears to be a male monkey, standing at 5'5" and weighing approximately 120 pounds. Its most striking feature is its red clown eyes, which appear to have no pupils or iris. SCP-9399 is often seen wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a gold chain around its neck. It also carries a candy stick for personal enjoyment.

SCP-9399's personality is multifaceted. It displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility in its position as a theater manager, but also enjoys engaging in playful and humorous activities such as singing and dancing. SCP-9399 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to get others to participate in its antics, leading to unpredictable and chaotic situations at times.

SCP-9399's theater appears to be sentient and able to produce elaborate stage sets and effects, including pyrotechnics, holograms, and live animals. The true nature of the theater and its connection to SCP-9399 is unknown and requires further investigation.

Addendum: SCP-9399 has demonstrated the ability to manifest and control anomalous properties in its theater performances. Its most notable instance involved multiple audience members reporting vivid hallucinations of a forest landscape during a performance of "Into the Woods." Investigation revealed that the theater's stage was built on a previously undiscovered ley line nexus. Extensive research and testing is required to fully understand SCP-9399 and its anomalous properties.
