Item #: 2422

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2422 is to be monitored at all times and kept under observation within their place of work, a veterinary clinic in downtown [REDACTED]. Any suspicious behavior is to be reported immediately to the Foundation.

Description: Subject 2422 is a human female of average height, with a distinctive set of facial features. These include bright red lipstick, blue clown eyes, and a pair of goggles that are frequently worn on their forehead. The subject's hairstyle is reminiscent of a 00s schoolgirl, and they are often seen wearing a cross-shaped earring in their left ear.

While the subject appears to have a relaxed and easy-going personality, they have been noted to display a fierce protectiveness towards their loved ones. This has led to several incidents where the subject has engaged in verbal (and occasionally physical) confrontations with individuals who may have insulted or threatened their friends or family members.

Despite their occupation as a veterinarian, Subject 2422 has demonstrated a keen interest in the paranormal and the supernatural. This has led to a few incidents where the subject has attempted to investigate strange occurrences within the city, often with mixed results.

Addendum: Upon investigation, it was discovered that Subject 2422 has a limited level of reality-warping abilities. While this does not appear to pose an immediate threat, further monitoring and study may be required to fully understand the extent of the subject's capabilities.
