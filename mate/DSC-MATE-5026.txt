SCP Foundation Classified Information:

Identification number 5026 is a highly unusual specimen even amongst the paranormal subjects the SCP Foundation is tasked with handling. Known as "The Lawyer", this individual is a male monkey with bright red clown eyes set in a face that is otherwise highly expressive and human-like in appearance. The Lawyer's head is adorned with green hair and a purple cap, which is accented by a two-color band on his forehead and a gold earring in each ear.

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Identification number 5026 is its choice of accessory - an LED gas mask which covers the face and can emit a wide range of colored lights. This item is thought to have been acquired via anomalous means, as its origin cannot be traced to any known manufacturer or previous owner.

In terms of personality, the Lawyer is a highly detail-oriented individual who can sometimes become excessively focused on minor details or organizational tasks. Despite this quirk, they are highly proficient in their designated profession and are known for being extremely effective in court cases due to their attention to detail.

Interactions with the Lawyer should be approached with caution, as their obsessive tendencies can cause them to become hostile or distracted if interrupted while performing a task. They have also displayed a high degree of intelligence, and are suspected of being capable of manipulating their surroundings to achieve their objectives.

As with all paranormal specimens, Identification number 5026 is to be kept under strict containment protocols at all times to prevent any potential breaches or unauthorized access by unprepared personnel.
