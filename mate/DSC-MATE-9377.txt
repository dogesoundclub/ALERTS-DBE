Item #: SCP-9377

Object class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9377 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site ██. All communication with SCP-9377 must be conducted via a secure voice-only communication system due to the unpredictable effects of SCP-9377's personality. Physical contact with SCP-9377 is strictly prohibited except under controlled testing conditions.

Description: SCP-9377 is a female human with distinct orange stripes on their cheeks and a noticeable smile. SCP-9377's eyes feature orange eyebrow markings, and they are often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a choker, and carrying a cigarette.

SCP-9377 is a highly analytical and logical individual who enjoys engaging in debates and arguments with others for personal enjoyment. They often seek out challenging or controversial topics to discuss, and their tenacity in these debates can lead to humorous situations where SCP-9377 becomes passionate about trivial or unimportant matters.

SCP-9377's profession as a veterinarian is significant as they possess a unique ability to communicate with animals. SCP-9377 can initiate telepathic communication with animals of all species, with various levels of effectiveness. However, this ability is unreliable and may cause some confusion and agitation in the involved parties.

SCP-9377's behavior is highly unpredictable and can significantly impact their surroundings. It is unclear if this is a direct result of their personality traits or if it is part of their anomalous nature. SCP-9377 is to be monitored carefully and treated with extreme caution to minimize any potential destructive outcomes.

Addendum: SCP-9377 has shown an interest in studying anomalous animals and their behaviors. This interest has been approved under controlled testing conditions by Site Directors for research purposes. Any experimentation concerning anomalous animals must receive prior approval from the Site Director in charge of the anomaly's containment.
