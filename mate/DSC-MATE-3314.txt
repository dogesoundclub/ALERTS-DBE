Item #: SCP-3314

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3314 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The subject is to be provided with basic human necessities, including food, water, and entertainment. Under no circumstances should SCP-3314 be allowed access to any outdoor activities or areas, as its love for adventure may pose a significant security risk.

Description: SCP-3314, also known as "the Theater Manager," is a humanoid entity appearing to be a female of the human species with spots all over the face and a permanent smile. The subject’s hair is blonde with an abnormal wing on the head, and the eyes are orange with an eyebrow similarly colored. SCP-3314 wears a golden earring and a choker, often accompanied by a medical mask covering the mouth.

SCP-3314 possesses a love for adventure and trying new things, resulting in several humorous stories, including the subject surviving a near-death experience from bungee jumping and being lost in the wilderness accidentally. The subject's personality may lead to unpredictable behavior, making containment challenging. SCP-3314 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, but the subject's restlessness and impulsiveness may pose a security threat in the long-term.

Addendum 3314-A: On █/██/20██, SCP-3314 requested to be allowed to attend a movie screening in Site-██'s theater. The request was approved, and a non-anomalous movie was presented to the subject. The screening proceeded without incident, but during the film's climax, SCP-3314 exhibited elevated emotional responses, specifically cheering and clapping loudly, disturbing some personnel.

Addendum 3314-B: On █/██/20██, Dr. ███████, the subject’s primary researcher, reported a strange phenomenon regarding SCP-3314's choker. After a routine medical exam, Dr. ███████ noticed the choker had become more luminous than usual, emitting a faint glow while making contact with SCP-3314's skin. Further testing is required to determine the choker's anomalous properties.
