Item #: DSC-MATE-4947 

Threat Level: Keter 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: 

DSC-MATE-4947 is to be contained within a reinforced room at Site-██. The room is to be equipped with personnel trained in close-quarters combat and the use of non-lethal tranquilizers. DSC-MATE-4947 is not to be allowed access to any technology or communication devices. 

Description: 

DSC-MATE-4947 is a female human with spots on her face and purple lips. Her eyes emit a jade LED that appears to constantly scan her surroundings. Her head is orange on the right side, and she wears a gold earring on her left ear. DSC-MATE-4947 also wears a black choker with a small electronic device attached. 

DSC-MATE-4947's personality is highly impulsive, which can sometimes lead to dangerous situations. While contained, DSC-MATE-4947 has exhibited a range of abilities, including enhanced strength and agility along with the ability to generate and manipulate energy. DSC-MATE-4947 also possesses a heightened resistance to physical force and chemical sedatives. 

The origin of DSC-MATE-4947's abilities are unknown, but it is believed that they are the result of exposure to an unknown entity or object. DSC-MATE-4947 has shown no willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel, and attempts to interview her have been met with hostility. 

Addendum: 

At 0400 hours, DSC-MATE-4947 breached containment and made an escape attempt. Security footage shows DSC-MATE-4947 using her enhanced strength and agility to overcome several guards before making her way to the facility's main exit. Foundation command authorized the use of lethal force to apprehend DSC-MATE-4947, but she was able to evade all attempted captures. DSC-MATE-4947 is at large and should be considered extremely dangerous. A manhunt has been initiated to locate and return DSC-MATE-4947 to Site-██ for further containment.
