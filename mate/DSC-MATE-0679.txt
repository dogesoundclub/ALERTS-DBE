Item #: SCP-679

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-679 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. The containment chamber must be equipped with at least two armed guards at all times. In addition, SCP-679 is to be provided with a studio space that mirrors a fashion studio with an allowance of fabrics, design permits, and tools required to create fashion.

Description: SCP-679 is a male monkey of unknown species that stands about 1.8 meters in height when upright. SCP-679 normally wears a red beanie and glasses along with a 2 color band on its forehead, gold earring, red scarf, and a whistle around its neck. SCP-679 is a well-known fashion designer within urban areas and is considered to be one of the most prominent within the industry. SCP-679 is given a monthly supply of high-end fabrics and tools to create fashionable clothing designs. SCP-679 has shown a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when it is needed. SCP-679 has also shown a preference for creating fashion with an urban or streetwear style.

SCP-679 was discovered in New York City in 20██, after several anomalous events, which included clothing design and fabric materialization in areas where SCP-679 had been last observed. SCP-679 was contained without incident and has since cooperated with Foundation staff.

Addendum: SCP-679 occasionally displays a particular interest in creating clothing for Foundation staff. SCP-679 has been noted to be attempting to document the appearance of various SCPs in an effort to create clothing designs based on the SCP appearances. The request has been denied.
