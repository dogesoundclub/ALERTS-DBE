Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2418 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19.

Any and all articles they produce for their job as a reporter are to be screened and redacted before publishing. Personnel are advised to interact with Subject 2418 with caution; while their personality is generally amiable, their sense of humor can sometimes be unpredictable.

Description: Subject 2418 appears to be a human male in his mid-30s with a slender build standing at about 5'8" in height. Other notable physical attributes include round-lensed nerd glasses, a police cap bearing the logo of a local TV news station, and a pair of goggles worn on his forehead. He also dons a jade earring on his right ear and a silver chain around his neck. 

Subject 2418's demeanor is friendly and socially approachable. They value harmonious relationships with those around them and often look for ways to be helpful or amusing to others. Subject 2418 has a particular affinity for humor and enjoys engaging in playful banter or telling jokes.

Despite their amicable nature, Subject 2418 should be considered potentially dangerous due to their occupation as a reporter.

Addendum: Subject 2418 has been useful to Site-19 in several instances of gathering information on anomalous activity occurring in public spaces. They have also managed to broach situations where knowledge of the unusual is required in order to save civilians, making them an invaluable asset to the Foundation.
