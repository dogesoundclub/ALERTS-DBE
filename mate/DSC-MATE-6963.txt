Item #: 6963

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 6963 is to be kept under close observation within a designated enclosure. All interaction with the subject must be conducted from behind durable barriers, as despite its modest frame, 6963 has been known to exhibit remarkable strength when frightened or agitated. A team of veterinary professionals are to be on-call at all times in case of unexpected medical emergencies.

Description:

Subject 6963 appears to be a non-anomalous monkey, standing at roughly 2.5 feet in height. Its face features a perpetually frightened mouth, likely a result of its genetic lineage. The eyes of 6963 are covered by nerdy glasses, which it seems to wear with great pride.

The subject's head is adorned with a vibrant blue bandana, and a pair of goggles rest atop its forehead. Though these goggles serve no apparent purpose, the reasons for their placement are uncertain, with some suggesting a fashion statement and others citing a possible pastime of welding or construction work.

A bright red scarf is one of 6963's favored accessories, which it is known to wear in colder temperatures. Despite its size, 6963 has exhibited a surprising level of dexterity, and has been known to use various tools within its enclosure in a manner not commonly seen in its species.

The most notable aspect of 6963's personality is its overwhelming sense of caring and nurturing. Whether towards its own kind, humans, or even inanimate objects, 6963 exhibits a level of empathy and compassion that is rare among even the most intelligent of creatures.

Addendum:

Though at first glance 6963 seems to be a benign and gentle creature, handlers are urged to exercise caution around the subject. Despite its gentle demeanor, its tendency towards fright can result in violent outbursts, and its physical strength should not be underestimated.
