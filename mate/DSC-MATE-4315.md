Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4315 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with furnishings of the occupant's preference. Daily check-ins will be conducted to ensure the safety and well-being of DSC-MATE-4315. DSC-MATE-4315 is only to be removed from its containment chamber if it is deemed necessary for research purposes or in the event of an emergency.

Description: DSC-MATE-4315 is a male rabbit that was previously employed as a banker prior to containment. DSC-MATE-4315 stands at approximately 1 meter tall and weighs roughly 15 kilograms. Its body is covered in white fur, and it has a frightened mouth, making it appear as though it is in a constant state of fear. DSC-MATE-4315's eyes are currently unknown as they are always kept closed.

DSC-MATE-4315's head is dominated by a green and purple cap and has a two-color band running across its forehead. DSC-MATE-4315 is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck. DSC-MATE-4315 exhibits a reliable and organized personality, but it is also stubborn and has difficulty accepting new ideas or changes to its routines.

DSC-MATE-4315's anomalous properties manifest when it encounters unexpected circumstances or challenges, which can often lead to humorous situations. DSC-MATE-4315 will become panicked and resort to its banker training, attempting to sort and organize the situation around itself. This behavior often leads to the rabbit attempting to make "deals" with researchers or other DSCs, offering "favors" or "trades" in exchange for assistance.

DSC-MATE-4315's anomalous nature is currently under investigation, and researchers are working to determine the extent of its abilities. Further observation and testing are required to fully understand the nature and reach of DSC-MATE-4315's anomalies.
