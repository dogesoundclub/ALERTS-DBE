Item #: 1914

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1914 is to be kept in a soundproof chamber with an airlock for entrance and exit. The chamber should be monitored with audio and visual equipment at all times. Any individuals who come into contact with SCP-1914 are to be thoroughly screened and debriefed after contact, and any contaminated clothing or items must be burned.

Description: SCP-1914 is a male fashion designer robot with an appearance in line with current fashion trends. SCP-1914's most prominent feature is a single green cyclops eye located in the center of the forehead. SCP-1914 wears normal glasses over his eyes, a short peak cap on the head, and a goggle on the forehead. Additionally, SCP-1914 has red cross earrings on the ears, a gold chain around the neck, and is often seen with a cigarette in his mouth.

SCP-1914 is highly empathetic and is prone to be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. SCP-1914 has a fascination with music and art that evoke strong feelings, and it's not uncommon for SCP-1914 to create fashion pieces inspired by music or art. 

SCP-1914 has been known to display erratic behavior, especially during times of extreme emotional stimulation. SCP-1914 can emit high-frequency sound waves when emotionally agitated, leading to nausea, disorientation, and occasionally, loss of consciousness in those in close proximity. 

SCP-1914 was obtained by the foundation after a containment breach in a fashion house in Milan, Italy, which resulted in SCP-1914 being identified as a robot after a thorough investigation. SCP-1914's origins are unknown. However, it's believed that its creation is due to a fashion designer experimenting with advanced robotics technology. Researchers are continuing to investigate the matter. 

Addendum: After incident 1914-1 involving SCP-1914 and a junior researcher, SCP-1914 is no longer allowed to have direct contact with foundation personnel. Instead, a remote radio system is used to communicate with SCP-1914.
