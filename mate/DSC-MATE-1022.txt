SCP-1022, codenamed "The Glamour Queen," is a female human with striking features that make her stand out in any crowd. Her face is accentuated by a bold, red lip and striking orange eyebrows that contrast beautifully with her 90s-style brown hair. On her forehead, she wears a colorful band with a goggle perched on top, which adds to the unique and creative aura she exudes.

As a Beautician, SCP-1022 possesses remarkable skills in enhancing the beauty of anyone she comes across. Her gold earrings and choker are a testament to her love for adornments, which she uses to accentuate the natural beauty of her clients. She is a true artist, bringing out the best in people with her talent and creativity.

However, SCP-1022's most notable trait is her ability to brainstorm and come up with innovative ideas. She is a natural problem solver, analyzing situations from different perspectives to find the best solution. While this can be beneficial, it can also lead to humorous situations where she suggests outlandish solutions merely to see how others would react.

SCP-1022 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, bringing creativity, talent, and ingenuity to any project she is involved in. Her unique talents and charming personality make her an essential part of the Foundation's team.
