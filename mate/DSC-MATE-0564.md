Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-564 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██.

She also sports a green cross earring and a choker around her neck.

DSC-MATE-564 displays a personality that values traditions and is often no-nonsense in her approach. However, she does possess a playful side, which can lead to humorous situations such as telling jokes or stories passed down through her family or community. DSC-MATE-564 has been observed to resist any changes to her routine, especially when it comes to farming.

DSC-MATE-564 is capable of conversing in English, but will switch to her native language of unknown origin when agitated or overly emotional. DSC-MATE-564 demonstrates an impressive level of knowledge in farming and animal husbandry, despite claiming to have never received formal education.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-564 initially came to the Foundation's attention after reports of strange farming practices and crop circles in a rural town in ██. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and found DSC-MATE-564 cultivating an anomalous crop of unknown origin. Upon retrieval, interrogation efforts revealed little about DSC-MATE-564's origins or the nature of her farming practices. Ongoing research into DSC-MATE-564's abilities and origins is being conducted at Site-██.
