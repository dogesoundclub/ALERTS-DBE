Item #: 3529

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 3529, also known as "The Tiger Kingpin," is to be contained in a reinforced cage made of high-grade steel. The cage is to be monitored at all times by armed security personnel, as any attempt to free the subject could result in catastrophic consequences. Subject 3529 is not to be approached by any personnel unless authorized by Level 4 clearance or above.

Description:

Subject 3529 appears to be a full-grown male Bengal tiger standing at approximately 7 feet. However, it possesses several features that distinguish it from a typical tiger. Its blue clown eyes are a noticeable and distinct feature, as is the goggle it wears on its forehead. The gold earring in its right ear and the gold chain it wears around its neck further set this creature apart from its species.

Subjects that have interacted with 3529 have reported that it possesses a nurturing personality that often leads it to care for individuals around it. Despite its ferocious reputation as a Mafia Boss, the creature has been known to take care of those close to it as if they were its own cubs.

It is important to note that this creature has an active role in the criminal underworld, and its actions have led to numerous fatalities. Its ability to rally and lead a group of loyal followers makes this creature an active threat not only to the public but to the Foundation as well.

Addendum:

Attempts to communicate with Subject 3529 have been unsuccessful. Due to the danger this creature poses, it is recommended that all future interactions with Subject 3529 are approached with caution, and only after consulting with Foundation commanders.
