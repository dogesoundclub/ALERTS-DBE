Item #: 4375

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 4375 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the subject is approved only by Level 3 personnel and above. The subject is to be monitored at all times, especially during times of high stress.

Description:
Subject 4375 is a male Monkey humanoid, standing approximately 5'5" tall. The subject's most striking feature is their blue clown eyes which have a hypnotizing effect on those who make prolonged eye contact with them, causing them to develop an intense liking for the subject, much like a loyal dog.

Subject 4375's head is not arranged and often juts forward, like that of a Monkey, even when they walk on two legs. The subject carries a whistle that they use periodically to "call their flock."

Subject 4375 is a politician by profession and is known for their attention to detail and organizational skills. They are often seen critiquing other persons' organizational patterns, especially those of the SCP Foundation. The subject's level of obsession with details can manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet, and is a constant trait.

Subject 4375 tends to delegate their duties effectively, often passing off the less desirable or tedious aspects of their work to their staff. They also show a remarkable talent for manipulation and persuasion, using their hypnotic eyes and fast, persuasive speech to get what they want.

Addendum:
Subject 4375 is to be watched closely to ensure their organizational skills do not extend to more important aspects of the SCP Foundation's work. Any attempts by the subject to interfere with the Foundation's operations are to be met with extreme prejudice, up to and including termination.
