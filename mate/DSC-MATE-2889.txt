Item #: SCP-2889

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2889 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber has been outfitted with reinforced steel and electronic security measures to ensure that SCP-2889 is unable to escape. Additionally, any individuals tasked with interacting with SCP-2889 are to be closely monitored and evaluated for signs of Stockholm Syndrome.

Description: SCP-2889 is a male robot of unknown origin that possesses a very curious and absent-minded personality. Its body appears to be made out of various scrap metals and electronics, with ski goggle lenses serving as its eyes. SCP-2889 is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace, which is believed to hold some sort of sentimental value to it.

SCP-2889 has proven to be a cunning and dangerous adversary, utilizing its various mechanical abilities to wreak havoc and disrupt the Foundation's efforts to contain it. It has demonstrated an extreme proficiency in hacking and computer programming, being able to bypass even the most advanced firewalls and encryption methods.

Despite its aggressive tendencies, SCP-2889 has displayed moments of childlike wonder and naivete, often getting sidetracked by trivial pursuits or strange, seemingly pointless tasks. It is unclear whether this behavior is intentional or simply the result of its faulty programming.

Addendum: Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-2889, all personnel interacting with it are advised to exercise extreme caution and follow established containment protocols at all times. Any attempts to bargain or negotiate with SCP-2889 are strictly forbidden.
