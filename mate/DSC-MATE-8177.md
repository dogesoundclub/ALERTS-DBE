Description: Subject 8177 is a male human, standing approximately 5'10" in height. He has a distinctive feature on his face, a spot on his mouth, which may be of anomalous origin. He is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, as well as a red victory band on his forehead. He also wears a silver chain around his neck, and can often be seen with a candy stick in his mouth.

Subject 8177 is a highly energetic and enthusiastic individual, often getting excited about even the most mundane tasks. He enjoys sharing his enthusiasm with others, although this can sometimes lead to awkward and humorous situations as his interests may not be shared by others.

Addendum: Subject 8177's mouth spot has been found to have a minor memetic effect, causing individuals who look directly at it to feel a sudden burst of happiness and joy. However, the effects are temporary and wear off quickly once the individual looks away. Further study is required to determine the extent of this effect and whether it poses any potential risks.
