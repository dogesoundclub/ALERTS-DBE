Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1835 is to be monitored at all times by field agents and electronic surveillance. Any unusual behavior, including conversations with inanimate objects, should be reported immediately to the Site Director. Subject is allowed to maintain his job as a car salesman, but the company he works for must be informed of his condition and instructed not to let him interact with any vehicles.

Description: Subject 1835 appears to be a middle-aged human male with a warm and welcoming smile. However, his eyes are not those of a human but instead resemble ski goggles. His head is a metallic purple that seems to shift in hue depending on the light in the room, and his ears are adorned with a green cross earring.

Personality-wise, Subject 1835 is a caring and nurturing individual. He has been known to anthropomorphize inanimate objects such as his car, plants, and even household appliances. He speaks to them as though they were sentient beings and treats them with the same level of care and respect he would show to any living creature.

It is unclear what caused Subject 1835's unique state of mind, but it is speculated that it may be the result of a magical or supernatural event. Despite his unusual behavior, he poses no physical threat to others, and his abilities have not been found to be harmful.

Interview Log 1835-1:

Dr. █████: Good afternoon, Subject 1835. How are you feeling today?

Subject 1835: Oh, I'm doing fantastic! My car is purring like a kitten today, and my plants are looking downright bushy.

Dr. █████: That's great to hear. Can you tell me a little bit about your relationship with your car and plants?

Subject 1835: (smiling) Well, my car is my trusty steed. I take care of her, and she takes care of me. And my plants, well, they're like my children. I talk to them, play music for them, and even give them little pats on the leaves for good measure.

Dr. █████: That's fascinating. Do you ever feel like these inanimate objects are alive?

Subject 1835: (pausing thoughtfully) To be honest, I don't know for sure. But I like to think that everything in this world has some kind of spirit or energy, you know? And if I can make my car or plants feel a little more loved and appreciated, then it's worth it.

Dr. █████: Understood. Thank you for your time, subject. We'll be in touch.

End Log.
