Item #: SCP-7071

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7071 is to be monitored at all times and confined within a standard humanoid containment cell located in Site-██. All communication with SCP-7071 must be done remotely through a secure video feed. Any attempt by SCP-7071 to manipulate or influence personnel must be reported immediately to Site Supervisor.

Description: SCP-7071 is a female humanoid of unknown origin, with orange stripes on their face and a permanent smile. Their appearance is that of a 00s schoolgirl, complete with a pair of goggles on their forehead and jade earrings. SCP-7071 frequently wears a gas mask as a precautionary measure.

SCP-7071 has identified themselves as a real estate agent, and their human status has been confirmed through multiple tests. However, SCP-7071's behavior and abilities suggest that they may possess anomalous traits. SCP-7071 has a tendency to act impulsively and recklessly, leading to frequent minor accidents and mishaps.

SCP-7071's anomalous properties have been observed to manifest under stress or intense emotions. In several instances, SCP-7071 has exhibited the ability to manipulate reality in small ways, such as changing the color of objects or briefly summoning minor objects out of thin air. The extent and limitations of SCP-7071's abilities are currently unknown.

Addendum: SCP-7071 has expressed interest in working with the Foundation as a consultant on "anomalous property development." This proposal has been denied due to SCP-7071's unpredictability and potential for accidental damage. Any further proposals by SCP-7071 should be met with caution and skepticism.
