Item #: SCP-7266

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7266 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment locker equipped with a webcam and microphone. As a former police officer, SCP-7266 is to have restricted access to firearms and any deadly weapon.

SCP-7266 is permitted to utilize its gift-giving skills to maintain morale among Foundation staff, but any gifts must be screened by a containment specialist for potential anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-7266 is a male tiger of the Bengal-subspecies. SCP-7266 possesses anthropomorphic features, including the ability to speak and exhibit human-like behaviors. SCP-7266 is observed to have a preference for wearing a purple cap with a headset and nerd glasses. A 2-color band is noted on its forehead, with a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-7266 also wears a gold chain and an LED gas mask for unknown reasons.

SCP-7266 has a keen eye for detail, which it uses to gift items to others. It can spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over the perfect gift for someone, which may appear obsessive. SCP-7266's gift-giving abilities are believed to be anomalous in nature, as the gifts it provides often coincide with unexpected and sometimes beneficial outcomes.

SCP-7266 was recruited into the Foundation as a liaison due to its former profession as a police officer. However, strict caution is advised in its implementation as an agent due to its observed empathic tendencies and potential to be swayed by sentimental values.

Addendum: SCP-7266 has expressed interest in participating in the annual Christmas party planning committee. The request is pending review by Site Director ██████████.
