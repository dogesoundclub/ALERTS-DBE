SCP Foundation Report- 3720

Object Class : Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3720 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell should have minimal decoration and only basic essentials that are required for survival. 3720 has requested a sewing machine and some basic fashion designing tools for recreational purposes. These items may be provided upon approval of the Site Director. 3720 has expressed no interest in escape or any aggressive behavior. However, they should be supervised at all times to monitor any change in behavior.

Description:

SCP-3720 is a human female identified as a fashion designer. They have distinctive features, such as spots on their face and bright red lips. The eyes are artificial and feature VR Rainbow LED technology. SCP-3720's hair is styled in an 00s school girl fashion with a red cross earring in each ear. They wear a silver chain and a gas mask around their neck.

SCP-3720's personality is unique, and they tend to be analytical and logical, basing decisions on evidence and data. However, they possess a quirky sense of humor and enjoy making witty observations or teasing their friends in a dry, deadpan way. They speak clearly and intelligently, never mincing words, which sometimes makes their colleagues uncomfortable.

SCP-3720's anomalous abilities, if any, are unknown. It is vital to note that SCP-3720, when under stress or duress or triggered, may become hostile and attempt to escape. They have also shown a tendency towards self-harm when provoked.

Addendum:

SCP-3720 is open to making clothes for other SCPs. This proposal is being considered, and tests are currently underway to see if this is feasible. SCP-3720 will be evaluated for suitability, and suitable SCPs will be identified. Clothing made by SCP-3720 will be thoroughly tested before use.
