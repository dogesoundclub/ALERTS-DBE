Item #: SCP-8029

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8029 is currently contained in a secure area in Site-19. Access to SCP-8029 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, who may visit it for research or maintenance purposes. SCP-8029 must be kept in running condition at all times, and any attempts to modify or dismantle it must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel. 

SCP-8029 is to be provided with necessary repairs, upgrades, and replacements to ensure that its energy levels are maintained at optimal levels. It is to be monitored for any potential signs of malfunction, and any unusual behavior should be reported to the project director immediately.

Description:

SCP-8029 is a humanoid robot, approximately 1.8 meters in height, with metallic silver plating and rainbow-colored LED lights for its eyes. It wears a short peak cap on its head, a jade earring in each ear, and a gold chain around its neck. Its mouth is covered by a medical mask that appears to be fused in place.

SCP-8029's primary function is that of a farmer. It is capable of planting and harvesting crops, milking cows, and performing other agricultural tasks autonomously. However, it also possesses a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality that is at odds with its otherwise robotic nature. SCP-8029 tends to get extremely excited about things that others find mundane, and this can sometimes lead to humorous or awkward situations.

SCP-8029 is powered by a self-sustaining, nuclear-powered energy cell that requires no external charging or refueling. It has shown remarkable resilience to damage and is capable of self-repair, although it still requires maintenance and upgrades from time to time.

Despite its cheerful demeanor, SCP-8029 exhibits signs of fear and anxiety, particularly when confronted with unusual or unfamiliar situations. It is, however, generally cooperative with Foundation personnel and has shown no signs of aggression. 

Addendum:

SCP-8029 was recovered from a small farming community in rural Montana, where it had been working as a farmer for several years. Local residents had reported seeing strange lights and hearing odd noises emanating from the farm, and the Foundation was alerted to investigate. SCP-8029 was initially unresponsive to Foundation officials, but after some modifications to its programming, it became more cooperative.
