Subject 2228, also known as "The Mechanic," is a male human with a striking appearance. His eyes are always covered by vintage ski goggles, adding an air of mystery to his already enigmatic nature. His smile is disarmingly charming, adorned by a medical mask to protect himself from toxic fumes and the elements. He wears a retro cap and a goggle on his forehead, perhaps as a symbol of his expertise in handling various mechanical devices. A Gold earring can be seen glinting in one of his ears, adding to his unconventional fashion choices.

Subject 2228 is a self-proclaimed idealist who yearns to make the world a better place. He has often been seen engaging in protests and boycotts, standing against any cause or company that might go against his values. He is a skilled mechanic, delving into the depths of machines to bring them back to life. His love for machines and his desire to make the world a better place, however, make for an intriguing combination of traits.

Despite his cheerful demeanor, The Mechanic is a stoic individual who seldom lets his emotions show. His intense focus on the task at hand often makes him seem detached from the world around him. There are rumors that he has worked on some highly dangerous and experimental machines, but these claims have yet to be verified.

Approach with caution when dealing with Subject 2228. While his intentions may be pure, his motives remain as mysterious as his appearance.
