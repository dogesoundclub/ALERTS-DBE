Description: DSC-MATE-6966 is a human male with a distinctive facial feature; a black spot on their mouth that seems to move and contort in response to emotions. The subject also has a set of VR Rainbow LED eyes, which emit a kaleidoscope of colors. DSC-MATE-6966's blonde hair and jade earring are noteworthy as well.

The DSC subject exhibits a reckless personality and impulsive tendencies, often acting before fully considering the situation at hand. This has caused minor accidents and mishaps in the past, leading to their ongoing classification as Euclid.

DSC-MATE-6966 is currently employed as a security guard and has exhibited a desire to impress and show off to others. This behavior, coupled with their impulsive nature, makes them a potential liability in high-pressure situations. It is highly recommended that DSC-MATE-6966's access to sensitive materials be restricted at all times.

The subject's red scarf appears to hold significant sentimental value and must not be tampered with. Attempts to remove the scarf have resulted in DSC-MATE-6966 displaying heightened aggression and severe emotional distress.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6966's apparent lack of concern for personal safety has led to several serious injuries, including a broken leg sustained during a botched attempt at parkour. Due to the danger posed by DSC-MATE-6966's behavior, it is recommended that any personnel interacting with the subject exercise extreme caution at all times.
