Item #: 8173

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8173 is to be monitored at all times during its shifts as a firefighter. Any anomalous behavior or abilities must be reported immediately to Site Director ███████.

Description: Subject 8173 appears to be a human male, approximately 5'10" in height with a muscular build. Its head is covered in a mass of unkempt green hair, which obscures its facial features. Instead, two ski goggles with dark lenses serve as its eyes. The subject shows no signs of discomfort wearing the goggles at all times, even during periods of high physical exertion.

Subject 8173 displays a very practical and hands-on personality, showing a persistent willingness to tackle problems in unconventional ways. This leads to a propensity for fixing objects using unorthodox methods such as duct tape, paper clips, or other improvised solutions. Reports from fellow firefighters indicate that Subject 8173 can often find solutions to complicated problems that others find too formidable. 

Addendum: On the evening of ██/██/20██, Subject 8173 displayed unusual regenerative abilities during its service during a particularly intense fire. Despite suffering severe burns over much of its body, the subject seemed to recover rapidly from its injuries, with no need for advanced medical care. Examination by medical staff afterward revealed no obvious scarring or other anomalous conditions. Further research into the source of the subject's regenerative capabilities is ongoing.
