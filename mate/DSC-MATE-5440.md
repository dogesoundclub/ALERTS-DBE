Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5440 is to be contained at Site-███ in a standard humanoid containment cell. The subject is allowed access to all approved forms of entertainment, including books, movies, and music. DSC-MATE-5440 is not allowed access to any electronic media capable of broadcasting to the public.

Description: DSC-MATE-5440 is a male human of average height and build. They have short brown hair styled in a retro cap and are often seen wearing large, gold hoop earrings. DSC-MATE-5440 is commonly seen with a smile on their face and a lit cigarette in their hand. They have been identified as a news anchor for a local television station.

DSC-MATE-5440's anomalous properties manifest in their ability to entertain and engage people. They possess a strong sense of duty towards their job and responsibilities, but they also know how to have fun. This often results in DSC-MATE-5440 acting as the life of the party, getting everyone to dance or sing along to their favorite songs.

DSC-MATE-5440 has demonstrated the ability to influence those around them, causing individuals to act in a manner similar to DSC-MATE-5440's own personality. This effect is limited in duration and fades once DSC-MATE-5440 is no longer present.

Addendum: Foundation operatives were alerted to DSC-MATE-5440's anomalous properties after several reports of people acting strangely after viewing one of DSC-MATE-5440's broadcasts. MTF Epsilon-6 "Village Idiots" was dispatched to investigate and contained DSC-MATE-5440 without incident. Following initial interviews, DSC-MATE-5440 has agreed to cooperate with Foundation efforts and participate in testing to determine the full extent of their abilities.
