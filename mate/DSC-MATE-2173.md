Item #: 2173

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2173 is currently contained within Site-███'s animal testing facilities. It is to be kept in an electrified, steel-reinforced cell, with reinforced glass windows and double doors. Any personnel accessing the containment chamber must wear orange electrostatic discharge grounding straps on their person to prevent accidental discharge. DSC-MATE-2173 is to be fed a diet of raw, lean meats and provided with toys for enrichment.

Description: DSC-MATE-2173 is a male, sentient Siberian tiger. It stands at 2 meters tall and weighs 250 kg. DSC-MATE-2173 is capable of speaking fluently in human languages, with a noticeable Chicago accent. DSC-MATE-2173 exhibits a preference for wearing jade earring and nerd glasses, and purple cap.

DSC-MATE-2173 is employed by the Site as an electrician, thanks to its natural ability to generate static electricity through rubbing its fur. DSC-MATE-2173 uses this ability to generate energy and power Site-███'s electronic equipment. DSC-MATE-2173 is outfitted with a whistle, which is used to signal when power is being generated.

DSC-MATE-2173 has shown a tendency to be stubborn, often clinging to routine and having a hard time accepting change. This is exacerbated by the frustration DSC-MATE-2173 experiences when its orderly plans are disrupted, often leading to unintentional comedic moments. Nonetheless, DSC-MATE-2173 is a reliable worker, and the benefits of its employment far outweigh its quirks.

Addendum: The Foundation is currently investigating how DSC-MATE-2173 gained its abilities and sentience, as well as tracing its origins. Investigations are ongoing.
