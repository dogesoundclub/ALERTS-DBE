Item #: SCP-4245

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4245 is to be kept in its designated containment chamber, which is to be outfitted with various forms of enrichment, as well as a stereo system capable of playing a wide variety of music. Daily check-ins by qualified medical staff are required to ensure SCP-4245's continued good health.

Description: SCP-4245 is a male specimen of the species Macaca fuscata (Japanese macaque), measuring approximately 30cm tall and weighing around 3 kg. Its fur is a reddish-brown color, with a light-colored face that is hairless except for a beard and mustache. SCP-4245 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, and a pair of nerd glasses.

On its forehead, SCP-4245 wears a pair of goggles, and it has a single jade earring in its left ear. It is often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck, as well as carrying a candy stick.

Despite being an animal, SCP-4245 possesses a level of intelligence that is far beyond what would be expected for its species. It exhibits exceptional cognitive abilities, including strong problem-solving skills, the ability to use tools, and a remarkable capacity for learning.

SCP-4245 appears to possess a strong sense of intuition and psychic powers, which it can use to predict things before they happen or sense when someone is feeling upset or anxious. This ability has been observed to be both impressive and a bit eerie.

In addition to its abilities, SCP-4245 has an affable and caring personality, which has endeared it to the personnel assigned to its care.

Addendum: Dr. ████████ was assigned to SCP-4245's containment, and has been able to form a strong bond with the animal, which appears to be beneficial to both parties. SCP-4245 has shown an aptitude for medicine and has been trained to assist Dr. ████████ in various tasks, including administering medication to other SCPs. It is the recommendation of Dr. ████████ that SCP-4245 be allowed to continue these duties.
