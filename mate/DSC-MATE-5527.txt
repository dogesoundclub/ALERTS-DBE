Description:

SCP-5527 is a male Siberian tiger. Its face features a frightened mouth and its eyes are replaced by a VR rainbow LED system, which changes in response to its emotions. SCP-5527 typically adorns a Doge hat, a gold chain, and carries a candy stick for recreational purposes. SCP-5527 displays a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality, often getting excited about things that others may not find as interesting. These traits have led to some humorous situations in the past.

SCP-5527 was formerly a known Mafia Boss in the city of ██████, ████. Its rise to power was fueled by its fear-inducing abilities and ruthless nature. SCP-5527 was a feared figure, capable of extreme violence and extortion. However, during a raid by local law enforcement, SCP-5527 was discovered and contained by the Foundation.

SCP-5527 is highly dangerous, and should not be underestimated. Its fear-inducing abilities make it a significant threat to any personnel who come into direct contact with it. Its unpredictable nature and energetic personality also make it difficult to control, and as such, it must be contained at all times. Any attempts to exploit or use SCP-5527's abilities for personal gain will result in immediate disciplinary action.
