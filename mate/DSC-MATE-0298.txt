Item #: SCP-298

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-298 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to basic amenities. Due to his role as a police officer, he is permitted limited outside contact but must be accompanied by Foundation security at all times. SCP-298 is to wear a medical mask and is to avoid physical contact with individuals, as his ability to sense emotions can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous outcomes.

Description: SCP-298 is a male human with spots on his face and a frightened mouth. His eyes are composed of VR Jade LED technology, and he wears a purple cap with a headset, a gold earring, and a red scarf. Although he appears like an ordinary police officer, SCP-298 possesses a unique ability to sense and manipulate emotions. He has a strong sense of empathy that allows him to connect with others on an emotional level.

SCP-298's ability can be both a gift and a curse. He has parlayed his innate talent into a successful law enforcement career, using it to defuse tense situations and calm potentially violent individuals. However, prolonged exposure to others' emotions can be overwhelming, leaving SCP-298 susceptible to emotional exhaustion and burnout. In these instances, his emotions can become unstable and unpredictable, causing him to inadvertently cause emotional distress to others.

SCP-298 is a well-intentioned individual who genuinely cares about the well-being of others. He is not aware that his abilities are anomalous and believes that he possesses a level of emotional intelligence that sets him apart from others in his field. The Foundation has utilized SCP-298's unique abilities to great effect in containment operations and diplomatic negotiations.

Addendum: Incident 298-A

On ██/██/20██, SCP-298 was exposed to a group of individuals experiencing severe emotional distress. Despite his best efforts to calm them, SCP-298 was unable to control their emotions and began exhibiting signs of emotional instability. All affected individuals were given Class-B amnestics, and SCP-298 was temporarily removed from field operations to receive counseling and evaluation. SCP-298 has since resumed his previous duties with added safeguards in place to limit exposure to potential emotional triggers.
