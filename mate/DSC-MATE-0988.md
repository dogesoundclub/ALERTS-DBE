DogeSoundClub Report: #988 - "The Mechanic Rabbit"

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-988 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to entertainment and literature may be granted at the discretion of the assigned personnel, as long as said privileges do not interfere with the containment of DSC-MATE-988.

Description: DSC-MATE-988 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. His demeanor is generally amicable, exhibiting a great deal of humor and quick wit. DSC-MATE-988 expresses a love for practical jokes, puns, and mockery, preferring to use humor to diffuse tension in potentially hostile situations.

DSC-MATE-988 adorns a hoodie over his rabbit body with a two-color band extending across his forehead. He is always seen sporting a pair of nerd glasses while wearing a red scarf for theatrical effect. The reasoning behind this attire is unknown, but DSC-MATE-988 has expressed that it provides him with a sense of personal identity.

DSC-MATE-988's anomalies only encompass his personality, though details regarding the rabbit's life lead the Foundation to believe there may be an elderly gentleman somewhere in the world with a desperate desire to retrieve his pet rabbit, which he believes was stolen from him.

Addendum: Contacting the elderly gentleman is proving difficult, which makes it increasingly likely that DSC-MATE-988 is a unique anomaly that was never a pet to begin with.

*Note to all personnel: While DSC-MATE-988 does enjoy making others laugh with his humor, researchers are advised to maintain a professional demeanor and not indulge in any prank wars with DSC-MATE-988.
