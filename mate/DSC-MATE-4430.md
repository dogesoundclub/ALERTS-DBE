Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4430 is to be monitored at all times while on-air or conducting interviews. Any deviations from standard broadcasting practices, such as sudden changes in tone or inappropriate language, must be reported immediately to Site Director ███████ for review. Any attempt at communication or contact outside of scheduled interviews must be denied and reported. DSC-MATE-4430 is only allowed to access live feeds with pre-approved content.

Description: DSC-MATE-4430 appears to be a human female of unknown age, with spots prominently visible on their face. Their blue clown eyes and bucket hat, combined with a silver chain necklace and jade earring, make them instantly recognizable in the public eye as a News Anchor. Upon close inspection, a two-color band is visible on their forehead, with a pair of goggles placed on top of it. They regularly wear a medical mask over their mouth, which has been determined to be for sanitary purposes.

DSC-MATE-4430's personality is noted to be jovial, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility to their profession. However, they also display a tendency towards humor and fun, often spontaneously encouraging those around them to participate in activities such as dancing and singing. It is unknown if this behavior is a side effect of DSC-MATE-4430's anomalous abilities or an intrinsic part of their personality.

Addendum: During a live broadcasting incident, DSC-MATE-4430 displayed behavior not typical of their normal demeanor, making several cryptic allusions to "the darkness that lies beneath." Following investigation, it was found that DSC-MATE-4430 had been exposed to a low-level anomalous aura in the broadcasting studio. To prevent future incidents, all equipment and personnel involved in DSC-MATE-4430's broadcasts are to undergo regular testing and screening for anomalous contamination.
