Item #: 1410

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1410 is to be monitored by agents at all times with cameras and audio devices near his office and home. Any changes of behavior, possessions or appearance must be reported to the Site Director. SCP-1410 is to be treated as a high-risk object and any attempts of communication must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-1410 is a human male, identified as a politician in [REDACTED]. The subject is approximately 45 years of age, and stands at 6'2" in height, and weighs 190 lbs. SCP-1410 is characterized by having orange stripes on his face, a frightened mouth, and normal glasses covering his green eyes. Additionally, SCP-1410 has a medical mask covering his mouth, a goggle on his forehead, and a green cross earring in his left ear. He also wears a gold chain around his neck as an accessory.

SCP-1410's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards his job which has occasionally led to mental breakdowns and loss of sleep. During these episodes, SCP-1410 is known to take on more work than he can manage, leading to humorous situations such as carrying too many things or trying to fit too many tasks into a single day. These episodes are known to last for one to two days before resolution.

SCP-1410's current possession of the medical mask is still unknown, but agents have hypothesized that he may have been exposed to some form of viral contagion. Attempts to retrieve the mask have proven unsuccessful due to SCP-1410's high public profile and political duties.

Addendum: Agent █████ has reported seeing SCP-1410 and another individual within his home conducting what appears to be a ritual. Further surveillance is needed to confirm any anomalous activity.
