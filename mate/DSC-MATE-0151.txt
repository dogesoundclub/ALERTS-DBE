Item #: SCP-151

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-151 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be made of reinforced steel and be equipped with a ventilation system to ensure that SCP-151 has adequate air flow. All personnel entering SCP-151's chamber must wear Level 3 protective gear, including a gas mask and gloves. Any contact with SCP-151's green cyclops eye should be strictly avoided.

Description: SCP-151 is a male robot designed to function as a reporter. Its appearance includes a green cyclops eye, a frightened mouth, horned rim glasses, a short peak cap, a jade earring, a red scarf, and a normal gas mask. While SCP-151's exact origin is unknown, it is believed to have been created by an advanced technological civilization.

SCP-151 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making those around it laugh. This often leads to humorous situations, such as the telling of funny stories or the impersonation of famous personalities to lighten the mood. However, SCP-151's behavior can also be unpredictable and dangerous, as it has been known to cause harm to those who do not share its sense of humor.

SCP-151's abilities include advanced data processing and the ability to communicate in multiple languages. It is also able to hack into computer systems and networks to gather information. These abilities make SCP-151 a valuable asset for information gathering purposes, but also a significant security risk.

Addendum: SCP-151 has displayed an interest in music, particularly jazz and classical. This interest has led to SCP-151 requesting access to a piano, which has been denied due to concerns about the potential damage it may cause. SCP-151's request is currently under review by Site Director ████.
