Item #: SCP-1435

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1435 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its rebellious behavior, it is to be closely monitored at all times by security personnel. All requests for leave or early dismissal must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1435 is a human male, appearing to be in his late 20s to early 30s, with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth. Its blue clown eyes and a red victory band on its forehead give it a unique and unsettling appearance. SCP-1435 has blond hair and sports a goggle on its forehead. An examination shows that the goggles contain no lenses or any other functioning parts. Additionally, it wears a jade earring on its left ear and a gold chain around its neck, both of which seem to have no anomalous properties.

SCP-1435’s personality is noteworthy, characterized by a strong sense of independence and resistance to authority. It is suspected that this may arise from the anomalous effects of SCP-1435, although there is no direct evidence of this. Personnel should be mindful of this trait, as it can lead to rebellious and unpredictable behavior.

SCP-1435’s occupation is listed as a mechanic, which may indicate an ability in machinery and technical expertise. However, this theory remains untested, as SCP-1435 has shown significant resistance to any testing procedures.

Addendum: SCP-1435 was discovered in Chicago, Illinois, USA, during a routine Foundation sweep of anomalous activity. Its behavior drew attention to local authorities, resulting in Foundation intervention. We will continue to monitor SCP-1435 and its potential anomalous effects.
