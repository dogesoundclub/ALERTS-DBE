SCP Foundation Report: Identification Number 1004, the Delivery Driver

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 1004 is to be monitored at all times, and must not be allowed to come into contact with civilians under any circumstances. They are to be held in a secure location equipped with appropriate medical and sedative equipment, to be used as necessary to quell any potentially dangerous situation.

Description: Identification number 1004, the Delivery Driver, is a human female of average height and build, with distinctive physical features that set them apart from others in their profession. They possess purple lips, blue clown eyes, and a blonde head with a wing protruding from the back. On their forehead, they sport a two-color band, which often attracts attention and has been noted to elicit a sense of discomfort in some individuals.

Identification number 1004 also wears a silver chain and is frequently seen with a cigarette in their hand, which they smoke despite warnings from medical professionals. Their personality is characterized by an innate nurturing and caring disposition, which often leads to them taking on the role of a maternal figure to those around them. This tendency to care for others, regardless of their relationship, has resulted in humorous situations where Identification number 1004 has acted as a parent to friends and family members.

In the past, Identification number 1004 exhibited erratic behavior, often manifesting in moments of intense aggression or bouts of depression. To date, the cause of these episodes remains unknown. However, Identification number 1004 has been administered medication to manage these outbursts and has been able to function reasonably well when appropriately medicated.

Addendum: Identification number 1004 was initially brought to the attention of the Foundation when they came into contact with a recently discovered anomalous entity. The entity's properties caused Identification number 1004's bizarre behavior and unpredictability to escalate, leading to a containment breach. After containment and recovery, Identification number 1004 was brought under the Foundation's care to ensure the entity's effects were not long-lasting.
