Item #: SCP-3036

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3036 is to be allowed to continue his profession as a fashion designer as long as his behavior poses no threat to the safety of others. SCP-3036 is currently situated in a studio apartment within the city, which is to be monitored by security personnel at all times. Any attempts to exit the designated location must be authorized by Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-3036 is a male human with a unique physical appearance. His face is adorned with a Mouth Spot, and a Clown Mouth which is perpetually open. He has Blue Clown Eyes and often sports a Green Cross Earring on his ears. Despite his appearance, SCP-3036 is a highly skilled fashion designer with commendable expertise in textile design, pattern-making, and garment construction.

SCP-3036 showcases a strong streak of rebellious behavior, which can manifest in the form of insubordination towards authority figures, sneaking out of his workplace early, or taking an unscheduled day off without prior notice. Due to his insatiable thirst for independence, SCP-3036 often ignores rules or regulations that he feels are unnecessary or impediments to his creative abilities.

SCP-3036's very presence seems to attract the attention of other paranormal entities, leading to his classification as a Euclid class SCP. However, the reasons behind this phenomenon remain unknown, and further research is necessary to gain insight into his unique abilities.

Addendum: SCP-3036 has been known to display heavily influential properties on the minds of his audience, to the extent that their behavior becomes erratic and excessive. These capabilities are considered containment hazards, and all exhibits created by SCP-3036 are to be tested for anomalous properties thoroughly.
