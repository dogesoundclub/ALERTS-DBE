Description: Subject 2811 is a female of human species working as a train driver. She possess facial spots, purple lips, and orange eyebrows, with a head of rainbow festival. Her forehead shows a two-color band and her ears contain a green cross earring. Two accessories notable for her are a choker and a cigarette. 

As a person, subject 2811 tend to be very introspective, often losing herself in intense thought process or daydreaming. This phenomenon increases her level of misperception in reality, leading to amusing situations where she can walk into a pole or trip over objects while lost in thought.

Currently, no physical abnormality associated with an anomalous event or SCP interaction has been recorded. However, subject 2811 is considered a potential liability if not strictly monitored, which merits her classification as Euclid.

Note: Researchers are currently trying to establish if subject 2811â€™s introspective nature is related to any SCP-related irregularities.
