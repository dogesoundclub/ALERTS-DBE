Item #: SCP-6320

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6320 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. All attempts to remove or alter SCP-6320's mouth spot and clown mouth have resulted in failure, and should not be attempted further. SCP-6320 is permitted to smoke their cigarette during designated times.

Description: SCP-6320 is a human male standing at 1.83 meters in height. Their most distinct features are their blue clown eyes and unusual mouth spot, both of which are difficult to describe and do not match any known human features. SCP-6320 is normally seen wearing a short peak cap and a goggle on their forehead, as well as a green cross earring and a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-6320 identifies as a mechanic, and displays remarkable creativity and resourcefulness when repairing objects. They often use unconventional methods to fix objects, such as duct tape or paper clips, and are capable of rigging make-shift solutions to problems that others may find too complex. 

SCP-6320's personality is generally pragmatic and hands-on. They enjoy working with their hands and often show a preference towards practical solutions that are efficient and effective.

Addendum: SCP-6320 has expressed a desire to be allowed to repair and modify the containment equipment. Further review of this request is currently pending.
