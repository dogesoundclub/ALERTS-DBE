Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5258 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times.

Description: SCP-5258 is a male monkey that works as a Real Estate Agent in [REDACTED], USA. SCP-5258's eyes are covered by shade glasses, and it has normal black hair. SCP-5258 wears a red scarf around its neck as its accessory. It has a strong and decisive personality, which can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating.

SCP-5258's abilities are not supernatural but its intelligence and communication skills are exceptional. SCP-5258 has shown it can understand human language fluently and is an efficient negotiator. It is also capable of convincing other humans to make irrational decisions that benefit itself, without the other party realizing it.

SCP-5258 came to the Foundation's attention when a client of [REDACTED] Real Estate Agency reported suspicious behavior and found SCP-5258 was the one responsible for it. An undercover agent confirmed SCP-5258's anomalous capabilities and was secured by Foundation personnel by posing as a potential client.

Addendum 5258-1: SCP-5258 has demonstrated knowledge of other anomalous entities and has shown a high willingness to operate with them. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of SCP-5258's involvement with anomalous affairs.

Addendum 5258-2: Incident 5258-A

SCP-5258 requested the Foundation to arrange a deal between it and a group of anomalous individuals for unknown purposes. During the negotiation, SCP-5258 was revealed to be acting on behalf of a GoI, [REDACTED]. As SCP-5258's request posed a threat to the Foundation's interests, it was denied, and adherence to standard protocols was reinforced. The incident demonstrated the necessity of ongoing oversight of SCP-5258's requests and interactions.
