SCP-4137, also known as "The Tiger Boss", is a male tiger of unknown origin who currently operates as the leader of a mafia organization. Though he has been observed wearing a multitude of clothing the most notable accessory he always wears is a medical mask over his mouth, likely due to the secrecy of his identity.

SCP-4137's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED core which glows a distinct hue of rainbow colors, and he is often seen wearing a doge hat atop his head. His ears sport a single golden earring, adding to his distinct fashion sense. He is rarely seen without the signature golden chain on his neck. It is unclear where he acquired his wealth, or how he came into power within the mafia ranks.

Personality-wise, SCP-4137 is known for being distractible and forgetful. He can become lost in thought or fixated on a project, at the expense of attending to more pressing matters. As a result, he is known for missing important appointments and forgetting about significant events. However, he is also known for being a great listener and a compassionate leader, always putting his subordinates' well-being above his personal interests.

If approached for questioning or capture, it is advised to proceed with caution as The Tiger Boss has a notorious reputation for being ruthless in his dealings.
