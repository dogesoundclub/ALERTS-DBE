Item #: SCP-9568

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9568 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. All personnel interacting with SCP-9568 must wear Level 2 Hazardous Materials suits and be screened for any symptoms of memetic contamination.

SCP-9568 must be denied access to any financial information or assets while contained within the Foundation's facilities. Any attempts at financial manipulation or fraud will be met with immediate disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-9568 appears to be a human male, employed as a banker at [REDACTED]. SCP-9568 exhibits several anomalous physical attributes, including red clown eyes, a mouth spot, and a medical mask covering his mouth. SCP-9568 also wears a pair of goggles on his forehead, a jade earring in his ear, and a gold chain around his neck.

SCP-9568's most notable attribute, however, is the two-color band on his forehead, which appears to pulsate with a memetic signal that causes those who see it to become enamored with SCP-9568 and his interests. This effect is believed to be limited to visual contact only, and researchers have yet to identify the exact nature of the memetic signal.

SCP-9568's personality is described as eccentric and creative, with a fascination for unusual hobbies and interests. In his spare time, SCP-9568 has been known to write poetry, create elaborate cosplay costumes, and collect unusual objects. Whether these hobbies are related to SCP-9568's anomalous attributes is currently unknown.

Addendum 9568-A: Following Incident 9568-B, involving SCP-9568's attempts at financial fraud within the Foundation, level 4 clearance is required for any interactions with, research into, or surveillance of SCP-9568. Any personnel found to be aiding or abetting SCP-9568 will be subject to immediate termination.
