Item #: DSC-MATE-8954

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8954 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times. All access to the containment area must be authorized by Level 3 personnel or above. Any attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-8954 must be supervised by at least two armed guards. In the event of a containment breach, the use of force is authorized to neutralize DSC-MATE-8954.

Description: DSC-MATE-8954 is a humanoid robot, designed to resemble a traffic officer. Standing at 7 feet tall, DSC-MATE-8954's entire body is made of metal, with various nuts and bolts visible on its surface. DSC-MATE-8954's most notable feature is its singular green Cyclops eye, accompanied by a frightened mouth underneath.

DSC-MATE-8954's eyes are ski goggles, and its head is adorned with a blue bandana. It also wears a jade earring and a gold chain as accessories, alongside a normal gas mask.

DSC-MATE-8954's personality is described as strong and decisive, with a tendency to come across as bossy or intimidating. These traits are attributed to DSC-MATE-8954's programming to ensure that all tasks are completed in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

DSC-MATE-8954 displays enhanced physical abilities, including near-indestructibility, super-strength, and agility. It is also capable of speech, but only communicates when necessary to complete a task.

DSC-MATE-8954 was discovered after reports of a traffic officer stopping a high-speed chase by physically stopping the perpetrator's car with its bare hands. The Foundation's investigation revealed that the officer was, in fact, DSC-MATE-8954, leading to its containment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8954 is to be used solely for Foundation purposes, as its programming may lead it to complete tasks outside of its containment if left unsupervised.
