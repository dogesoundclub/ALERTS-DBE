Item #: 5556

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its propensity for destruction and sinister actions, 5556 must be contained within a secure chamber, reinforced with metal plating and electrical barriers. Access must be granted only to personnel with proper clearance, and observation of its behavior should be conducted through a monitored camera system. Any attempt at conversation with 5556 must be made alongside multiple reinforcements and essential communication equipment, as it is known to use persuasive tactics and manipulation to escape confinement.

Description: 5556 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, measuring approximately 1.3m in height, with vibrant, VR Rainbow LED eyes that change tone depending on his mood, and a terrified mouth expression. They wear a purple cap fitted with a headset, fashioned with a Jade earring on each side, further accentuated by a gold chain that circles its neck, and routinely smoke cigarettes. Despite their cute appearance, personnel must all exercise caution around 5556, due to the extreme danger it poses.

Personality: 5556 displays deeply rooted cultural values and a traditionalist outlook that often conflicts with contemporaneous urban society. Despite this, 5556 has maintained an element of playfulness, frequently telling humorous anecdotes derived from its lineage or community. Observation of its behavior indicates it uses its humorous façade as an instrument in its nefarious activities to disarm potential victims, instilling unsuspecting targets with a false sense of security.

Additionally, 5556 displays a cunning and conniving nature. Its tactics frequently result in destructive consequences, and staff must exercise caution during interactions, as it is known to use manipulative language in attempts to deceive or bargain with observers. While  5556 may come across as playful, they are a high-risk villain who should be approached with extreme caution.

Discovery: 5556 was first discovered in a dense forest by a team carrying out a routine animal population survey that reported strange disappearances of multiple forest-dwelling creatures. Upon discovering the extent of 5556’s capabilities, protocol dictated a containment procedure, and the specialized team was engaged to apprehend it before containing and transferring it to the requisite facility.

Addendum 5556-A: While unsure of the origins or intent of 5556’s manipulative traits, initial observations suggest that they stem from its family or community. All communication methods requesting information around the knowledge of these traits have been unsuccessful. Further research is ongoing. 

Addendum 5556-B: Subject 5556 is suspected of collaborating with several other entities. Request for collaboration of resources to monitor and investigate relationships with these entities has been approved.
