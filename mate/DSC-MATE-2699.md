Description: DSC-MATE-2699 appears to be a human male in his late 20s. DSC-MATE-2699 stands at approximately 6 feet in height and weighs approximately 200 pounds. DSC-MATE-2699's most notable feature is his spotted face with a contagious smile. DSC-MATE-2699 has parted pink hair, which appears to be a unique genetic anomaly.

DSC-MATE-2699 is a police officer who possesses a strong sense of empathy and is often very attuned to the emotions of others. This ability can lead to humorous situations as DSC-MATE-2699 knows just the right thing to say to make someone feel better, and helps others see the humor in difficult situations. DSC-MATE-2699's empathy, however, can also cause emotional distress if not properly managed.

DSC-MATE-2699's emotional empathy has been observed to have an effect on others around him. DSC-MATE-2699 can cause an emotional attachment towards him, urging others to follow his lead, and to take actions that they would not normally be inclined to take. DSC-MATE-2699 is not aware of this effect, and there is no indication that DSC-MATE-2699 is able to control or manipulate it.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-2699's strong empathic abilities, it has been suggested that he be considered for the DSC Support Staff program, where he can provide emotional support for DSC personnel. Request for reclassification pending.
