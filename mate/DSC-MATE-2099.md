Item #: 2099

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2099 has been allowed to continue its occupation as a traffic officer, but its activity must be restricted to specific areas of the city. It is not allowed to interact with individuals outside of its duties, especially on gift-giving events. Any attempt to do so must be reported immediately to the Foundation. Subject 2099 must wear a uniform with an embedded radio system at all times, and two agents must accompany it during fieldwork.

Description: Subject 2099 is a female human with distinctive orange stripes on its face, which are believed to be a result of an unknown genetic or anomalous alteration. It has crimson, clown-like eyes that often focus on small details, making it ideal for traffic-related tasks. The subject's 90s brown hair and red lip, combined with a green cross earring and a silver chain, are also noticeable features. 

Subject 2099 is highly observant and tends to fret over details in its personal and professional life, including gift-giving; this fixation on perfection can lead to obsessive behavior detrimental to its own well-being. However, it has good communication skills and problem-solving abilities that make it an effective traffic officer. Subject 2099 also displays a strong addiction to smoking, which should be accounted for in any interaction with its person. 

Addendum: Due to the nature of its ability to detect small details, subject 2099 was assigned to a team responsible for identifying subtle alterations in reality caused by anomalies. However, due to the potential for obsession, the proximity of other anomalies was deemed too risky for Subject 2099 and reassigned to traffic control.
