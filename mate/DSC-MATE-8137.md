DSC-MATE-8137 displays an extraordinary sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. However, this tendency has the potential to subvert the professionalism and focus of Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-8137's ability to induce positive emotional states in personnel could potentially be further investigated for pacification of hostile targets. However, due to DSC-MATE-8137's unpredictable nature, testing is currently on hold.
