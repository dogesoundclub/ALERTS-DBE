Description: DSC-MATE-6849 is a male Tiger that stands approximately 7 feet tall when on two legs. It appears to be capable of speaking in fluent English, but sometimes has difficulty with certain words due to its feline mouth structure. DSC-MATE-6849 often wears a normal gas mask, which seems to help it breathe more easily. It has a red cross earring on one of its ears and a silver chain around its neck. 

However, DSC-MATE-6849's most notable feature is its frightened mouth, which appears to be permanently stuck in a scared position. This often leads to comical situations, as DSC-MATE-6849's charismatic personality puts those around it at ease despite its intimidating appearance.
