Item #: 2883

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2883 is to be contained in a Class-D humanoid containment chamber with a small indoor railway. The railway must be maintained, and SCP-2883 should be given access to it during designated hours. No personnel with a fear of rabbits or commitment to vegan lifestyles are permitted to interact with SCP-2883. In addition, all security and research personnel must be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit fever before entering SCP-2883’s containment area.

Description: SCP-2883 is a male rabbit of the Lepus europaeus species. It stands at approximately 1.5 meters tall, which is significantly larger than other rabbits of its species. SCP-2883 is generally harmless and possesses no anomalous abilities. However, it exhibits human-like behaviors and is able to communicate fluently in several languages, including English, French, and Spanish. SCP-2883 also displays a fondness for cigarette smoking and has been observed holding a lit cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-2883 exhibits a no-nonsense attitude and values traditional beliefs and customs. It often tells stories and jokes that have been passed down through its family and community, which can occasionally result in humorously awkward situations. Despite its strict adherence to tradition, SCP-2883 has a playful side and enjoys engaging in harmless pranks and jokes with its caretakers. It is also skilled at mechanical and engineering tasks, and has expressed an interest in trains and railway systems.

SCP-2883 was initially apprehended when reports of an anthropomorphic rabbit operating a train on an abandoned railway line were made to the local authorities. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and found SCP-2883 in the driver’s cabin. It is currently unknown how SCP-2883 gained the knowledge and ability to operate a train, or how it developed its human-like behaviors.

Addendum 2883-1: SCP-2883 has requested access to railway engineering materials, including technical manuals and blueprints. This request is pending review by the Ethics Committee.
