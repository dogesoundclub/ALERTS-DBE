SCP-353, known colloquially as "the Electrician," is a human male of average height and build. He is often seen wearing a well-worn bucket hat, which he claims is his lucky hat, as well as a pair of thick nerd glasses. His left ear is adorned with a flashy gold earring, which he often fiddles with absentmindedly. In addition, he is rarely seen without his treasured gold chain, a family heirloom that he claims gives him inner strength.

SCP-353 is a highly analytical and logical individual, always eager to test his skills against others. He enjoys nothing more than a good debate or argument, whether it be about politics, science or the best way to wire a circuit board. His natural curiosity and drive to always be learning often leads him to explore complex topics that others find too abstract or unimportant.

Despite his analytical mind, SCP-353 has a strong sense of humor and enjoys making witty quips and jokes. He can often be found making light of serious situations, which has led to some tension with his colleagues who find his levity inappropriate at times. Despite this, SCP-353 remains a valuable member of our team, always eager to lend a hand with any electrical difficulties that come our way.
