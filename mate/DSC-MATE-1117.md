Item #: 1117

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1117 is to be assigned to the security duty of sector B of the Foundation's main facility. He must not be allowed any access to the anomaly containment areas without proper authorisation. The subject's residence is to be monitored for any signs of projection of sentient capacities towards the objects and plants around him.

Description: Subject 1117 is a human male with orange stripes on his facial features. The subject's eyes visibly stand out, as they resemble clown eyes of blue hue. He covers his head in a short peak cap, which may create confusion for ordinary observers. Subject 1117 sports a Jade Earring on his right earlobe and is often seen holding a cigarette in his lips.

Subject 1117 displays an intriguing personality trait, their kindness and nurturing attitude extend to inanimate objects as well. They have the tendency to name their car, talk to their plants, and even anthropomorphise their mundane appliances, treating them like their own family members. This can create an emotional attachment to things around him with unknown effects on his surroundings.

Addendum: According to the subject's psychologist, this behaviour stems from a deep-seated need for companionship and love. Further analysis is required to determine if this unique quality could be put to use in the Foundation's favour. Nevertheless, Subject 1117's exceptional abilities to care for even lifeless objects must be monitored carefully.
