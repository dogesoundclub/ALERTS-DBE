Item #: SCP-8629

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8629 is currently contained in an isolated room within Site-███. All interactions with SCP-8629 must be conducted with the presence of at least two Level 3 personnel, and any physical contact with SCP-8629 must be strictly regulated. A medical mask must be worn by any personnel within a 2-meter radius of SCP-8629, and eye protection is mandatory when interacting with SCP-8629. Under no circumstances should SCP-8629 be permitted to leave its containment area.

Description: SCP-8629 is a human male of indeterminate age and origin. SCP-8629's most notable feature is the presence of orange stripes on his face, as well as a frightened mouth. SCP-8629's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED technology, and a goggle is consistently present on SCP-8629's forehead. SCP-8629's ears are adorned with a gold earring, and a silver chain is worn around their neck. SCP-8629's head is shaven and resembles that of a monk.

SCP-8629 is a beautician by trade and has a strong sense of independence. This personality trait, however, may lead to situations where SCP-8629 may attempt to undertake tasks beyond their capability, such as attempting to move heavy objects or refusing to use a map when lost. Due to SCP-8629's unpredictable behavior, caution must always be exercised during interactions.

SCP-8629 was located initially in the city of [REDACTED], reportedly causing various anomalous events in the local beauty salon. Foundation operatives were dispatched to investigate and contain SCP-8629. SCP-8629 was brought into custody without incident, and the area was amnestized.

Addendum: SCP-8629 has demonstrated the ability to manipulate small tools and instruments using a combination of their hands and various appendages. A request has been submitted to authorize limited testing in controlled settings.
