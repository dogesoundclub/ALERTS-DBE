SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:
SCP-9227 is to be contained within a reinforced cell at all times. Extreme caution must be exercised when handling SCP-9227, as its escape can result in catastrophic consequences.

Access to SCP-9227 is only allowed for testing purposes and must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel or higher.

DESCRIPTION:
SCP-9227 is a male Tiger identified as a news anchor who possesses extraordinary abnormal traits. SCP-9227's eyes resemble blue clown eyes, while its hair appears unarranged and green. SCP-9227's forehead features two color bands, and it carries a gold earring upon its ears. It wears a medical mask which covers its mouth.

SCP-9227 displays rebellious behavior, frequently showing resistance to unnecessary authority and rules. It often sneaks out of its office early or takes a day off without permission.

SCP-9227's true power lies in its ability to transform its body into an unknown form, which poses a significant risk to the safety of its surroundings. SCP-9227's transformation can occur at any time with no apparent trigger, and once it occurs, SCP-9227's behavior tends to become more erratic and aggressive.

SCP-9227's transformation has the potential to cause immense destruction, as it unleashes an unknown energy that engulfs the area within its vicinity. This energy displays an unquantifiable effect on its surroundings, and its behavior while transformed is unpredictable and highly volatile.

It is crucial to note that SCP-9227's containment must be maintained at all times as it poses a severe threat to civilians and local infrastructure. In the event of an escape, quarantine procedures will be implemented immediately to prevent any further damage.
