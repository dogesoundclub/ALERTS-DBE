Item #: SCP-730

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-730 is to be kept in a secure room within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-730 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, requiring approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-730's requests for cosmetic tools and products are to be granted within reason, as they appear to be a cooperative individual. However, any attempts to take advantage of Staff's trust or use tools in a dangerous or hazardous manner should be reported to Site Management immediately.

Description: SCP-730 is a male human of average height and medium build, appearing to be in their late 20s to early 30s. They exhibit a unique physical characteristic of orange stripes on their cheeks which appear to be cosmetic in nature. SCP-730 identifies as a beautician and is knowledgeable in various beauty treatments and procedures. 

SCP-730 wears a retro cap and is often seen with a silver chain and jade earring. Their eyes are obscured by normal glasses but are of standard human physiology. SCP-730 is frequently seen with a cigarette, although they appear to be aware of their potential negative effects and request an electronic cigarette when asked.

SCP-730 has a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to their work as a beautician. They are cooperative and charismatic, often being the life of the party among their coworkers. Despite their sense of duty, SCP-730 knows how to balance work and play, frequently getting their colleagues to enjoy themselves with music and dancing. 

SCP-730 has not exhibited any anomalous properties and does not pose a threat to Foundation operations. SCP-730's unique physical feature and knowledge of beauty treatments may be of interest to the Global Occult Coalition or other relevant organizations, and caution should be exercised in the event of dissemination. 

Addendum 730-A: SCP-730's unique cosmetic feature is believed to be linked to an anomalous phenomenon that occurred in the Beijing region during the 2050s. Further investigation into similar anomalies is ongoing, and SCP-730 is to be monitored for any potential changes or developments.
