SCP-9208 is a humanoid entity, identified as a Real Estate Agent by profession. The subject appears to be a human female with brown 90s hair and red clown eyes. The most distinguishing feature on their face is the presence of spots, accompanied by red lips that contrast sharply against their face. 

Examination of the subject's personality has revealed that they possess a strong sense of obligation and responsibility towards their work, often taking their job quite seriously. However, they have also been observed to have a fun-loving side and enjoy letting loose during leisure activities, particularly when it comes to dancing. 

Despite their serious demeanor at work, SCP-9208 has a knack for surprising those around them with their silly antics, often initiating dance-offs with colleagues at social events or performing comedic acts to entertain others. 

It is advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-9208, given the potential for them to go from a professional demeanor to a relatively carefree attitude at any moment. Under no circumstances should subjects engage in activities that may cause harm or injury during such occurrences.
