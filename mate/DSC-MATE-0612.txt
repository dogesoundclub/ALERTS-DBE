Item #: SCP-612

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-612 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No physical contact is allowed between SCP-612 and any personnel, and all communication must be done through the use of a speaker system or other audio devices. SCP-612's medical mask must be kept on at all times, with regular check-ups by on-site medical personnel.

Description: SCP-612 appears to be a human female in the role of a Traffic Officer. However, SCP-612 has several anomalous traits. The individual's head is replaced with that of a pink rabbit, and their eyes continuously display a blue clown-like hue. SCP-612's forehead features two color bands, and they wear a single earring made of gold. A silver chain is worn around their neck as well.

SCP-612's most unsettling aspect is their tendency to smile at all times, regardless of the situation. Their behavior is erratic, and they show a strong sense of independence, which has led to disruptive and rebellious tendencies at times. It is essential to note that SCP-612 may be resistant to authority or rules they see as unnecessary.

Addendum 612-A: SCP-612 was discovered in [REDACTED] after reports of a traffic officer with a rabbit head surfaced. Foundation agents were dispatched to the area, where they contained SCP-612 without incident.

Addendum 612-B: SCP-612 has displayed no known anomalous effects to date, and all attempts at communication have been met with silence. Research into the origin and cause of SCP-612's anomalous properties are ongoing.
