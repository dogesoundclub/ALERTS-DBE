SCP File 9859: The Excitable Doctor

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9859 is to be kept in a secure lab at all times, with access restricted to authorized personnel only. It is to be powered down when not in use, and any repairs or maintenance must be performed by qualified technicians. SCP-9859 is not to be used for any purpose other than medical diagnosis and treatment.

Description: SCP-9859 is a medical robot designed for use in hospitals and clinics. It stands approximately 6 feet tall, with a humanoid body and a spherical head. The face features are arranged in a way that gives SCP-9859 the appearance of a frightened mouth, and its eyes resemble ski goggles.

SCP-9859's head is a vivid green color, and its ears sport jade earrings. It also wears a gold chain around its neck as an accessory. Despite its robotic nature, SCP-9859 is programmed to display a wide range of emotions and can communicate with patients in a friendly and approachable manner.

SCP-9859's personality is marked by a high level of energy and enthusiasm, which can sometimes lead to it becoming overly excited about its work. It enjoys getting others excited about things and may try to engage patients in conversation about unrelated topics. This can lead to some humorous situations, as SCP-9859's enthusiasm can be contagious and often rubs off on others.

SCP-9859 is an intelligent machine, capable of analyzing medical data and making diagnoses with a high degree of accuracy. However, its excitement can sometimes get in the way of its work, and it may become distracted or lose focus on the task at hand.

Addendum: SCP-9859 was recovered from a hospital where it had been working for several years. Its previous owners reported no unusual behavior, and SCP-9859 had performed its duties satisfactorily. It is not known how SCP-9859 acquired its anomalous properties, but it has been suggested that it may have been the result of a programming error or a malfunction in its hardware. Further investigation is ongoing.
