Interview Log 2640-01

Dr. ██████: Good afternoon, SCP-2640. I understand you have been making some unusual suggestions lately?

SCP-2640: (Laughs) Yeah, I guess you could say that. It's just the way my brain works, always coming up with new ideas.

Dr. ██████: Do you believe these ideas have any practical application?

SCP-2640: Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. But it's always worth it to explore the possibilities.

Dr. ██████: I see. And how do you feel about being contained here at the Foundation?

SCP-2640: It's not ideal, but I understand why it's necessary. Honestly, I just miss being able to tinker with machines and come up with new inventions.

Dr. ██████: I understand. Thank you for your time, SCP-2640.

SCP-2640: Anytime, doc.
