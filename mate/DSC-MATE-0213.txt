SCP-213 displays red clown-like eyes which appear to have no adverse physical effects on him. He wears a blue bandana on his head and a gas mask which, upon testing, has been discovered to be nondescript.

SCP-213's forehead features a goggle he wears atop his forehead, as well as a gold earring on his left ear. SCP-213 exhibits a personality that is outgoing and tends towards a great sense of humor. SCP-213 also exhibits an ability to connect with others and is adept at making people laugh. It has been reported that this personality trait can, at times, cause issues in regards to containment because site personnel tend to enjoy spending time with SCP-213.
