Item #: SCP-1310

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1310 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when it is not necessary for it to be outside, and is to be provided with basic amenities including food and water for sustenance. SCP-1310 is not to be given access to any form of communication device or the internet. Access to SCP-1310 is restricted to Level 2 personnel only, and any interaction with SCP-1310 must be conducted under supervision.

Description: SCP-1310 is a human male of average height and build, with distinctive spotted skin. It is often seen wearing a red beanie with a two-color band on its forehead, and normal glasses over its eyes. SCP-1310 also wears a green cross earring, a gold chain around its neck, and carries a candy stick as a form of stress relief. It is employed as a fast-food worker.

SCP-1310 is known for its ambitious and goal-oriented nature, with a tendency to take on more than it can handle. However, it usually manages to pull off its tasks thanks to its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills. SCP-1310 has displayed high levels of resilience and determination in the face of adversity, and is capable of adapting to new situations quickly.

While SCP-1310 has not shown any overtly anomalous abilities, its resilience and quick-thinking are unusual and indicate that it may be capable of minor reality-bending effects. Further testing is required to verify this hypothesis.

Addendum: Requests for SCP-1310 to be employed as a member of Foundation staff are currently under review, pending results of further testing.
