Item #: DSC-MATE-5470

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5470 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage, measuring 8 x 5 meters with a minimum of 3 meters of height. The cage must be equipped with tranquilizer darts and special heat sensors that track any anomalous temperature change in the vicinity of DSC-MATE-5470. Access to DSC-MATE-5470 requires Level 3 clearance and must be accompanied by at least two armed guards. DSC-MATE-5470 is to be fed twice daily with standard carnivorous tiger diet.

Description: DSC-MATE-5470 is a male tiger with VR Rainbow LED eyes and a frightened mouth expression. DSC-MATE-5470 is frequently seen wearing a bucket hat, with goggles on its forehead and a red cross earring on its left ear. DSC-MATE-5470 is addicted to cigarette smoking, and observations indicated it tends to exhibit nervousness and agitation when denied cigarettes for prolonged periods.

DSC-MATE-5470 has an unusually high level of natural charm and charisma, particularly when interacting with humans. DSC-MATE-5470 is capable of using its abilities to make humorous situations or bring laughter and joy to those around it. However, DSC-MATE-5470's natural charm makes it a potential security risk as it may attempt to escape or manipulate the guards.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5470 was initially discovered in a circus in [REDACTED], Thailand, where it was performing as an attraction. The Foundation was alerted when DSC-MATE-5470 began exhibiting anomalous behavior, causing several incidents of destruction and injury. DSC-MATE-5470 was subsequently contained and brought to Site-██, where it has been kept in custody since its containment. Further research is ongoing to determine the precise origins of DSC-MATE-5470's anomalous traits.
