SCP-1987 possesses red clown eyes that emit a glowing effect. SCP-1987 has been observed to be highly emotional and impulsive, leading to some amusing predicaments.

Personality: SCP-1987 is known for its unpredictable behavior stemming from its emotional tendencies, rather than rational thought processes. It is prone to acting quickly and spontaneously, creating confusing and hilariously surprising situations for its human counterparts.

SCP-1987 has displayed a limited ability to communicate in English, but it primarily communicates through growling and body language. SCP-1987 has proven to have a strong bond with humans, particularly those of its firefighting unit. It is assumed that it believes itself to be a full-time firefighter.

SCP-1987 has not shown any signs of aggressive behavior towards humans; however, it is critical to interact with SCP-1987 with caution, as sudden movements or loud noises may trigger an aggressive response.

SCP-1987 poses a significant risk to human life and will require ongoing monitoring to ensure the safety of both SCP-1987 and its human counterparts.
