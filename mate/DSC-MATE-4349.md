DogeSoundClub Containment Report 
Subject Identification Number: 4349
 
Object Class: Keter
 
Description: DSC-MATE-4349 is a male monkey, approximately 1.2 meters in height, with jade earrings and a gold chain around its neck. It is currently serving as a traffic officer in [REDACTED] City. 
 
The most notable feature of DSC-MATE-4349 is its LED gas mask, which is worn at all times, and was recovered from a local military base during a containment breach incident. When questioned, DSC-MATE-4349 was able to provide no clear reason for its acquisition and utilization of the gas mask. Despite extensive medical tests and observations, it is unclear how DSC-MATE-4349 obtained the cognitive and physical abilities necessary to function as a traffic officer.
 
DSC-MATE-4349 has demonstrated an affinity for risk-taking and adventure-seeking behavior. This personality trait often leads to humorous or dangerous situations, including surviving a near-fatal bungee jumping accident and an incident in which it became lost in the wilderness. When confronted, DSC-MATE-4349 has shown a tendency to become combative, necessitating armed containment measures. 
 
Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4349 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, suspended above the ground, to prevent escape or contact with non-DSC personnel. All staff members entering the containment chamber must be equipped with gas masks, as DSC-MATE-4349 has been known to emit noxious gas when in distress or angered. 
 
All interactions with DSC-MATE-4349, including feeding and cleaning, must be conducted via remote mechanical handling devices. Under no circumstances should any personnel approach DSC-MATE-4349 without authorized protective equipment and weapons. DSC-MATE-4349 is to be monitored 24/7 for any signs of anomalous behavior, including attempts at escape or manipulation of equipment. 
 
Special Containment Procedures: No experiments are to be conducted with DSC-MATE-4349, as the risks associated with this subject's behavior have prevented the development of any safe experimental protocols. Any attempts to use DSC-MATE-4349 for field operations without prior clearance from O5 Council will result in immediate disciplinary action. 
 
Additional notes: DSC-MATE-4349 has exhibited instances of intelligence and problem-solving skills beyond that of a typical monkey. It remains unclear how this subject gained its cognitive abilities or if they will continue to develop. It is speculated that DSC-MATE-4349 may have ties to other anomalous entities or organizations, and mobile task forces are instructed to investigate any potential leads. All documentation and interactions with DSC-MATE-4349 are to be handled with extreme caution and diligence, as this subject poses a high risk to all personnel and the general population.
