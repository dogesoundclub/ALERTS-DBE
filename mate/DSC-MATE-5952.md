Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5952 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, and is to be monitored closely for any signs of aggression or escape attempts. Due to its legal profession, DSC-MATE-5952 is allowed access to any legal documents and literature required to perform his duties, but all communications with outside parties are to be screened and monitored by Foundation personnel at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-5952 appears to be a male tiger of unknown subspecies, with blue clown eyes and a doge hat on its head. It wears a gold earring on one ear and a medical mask over its mouth, believed to be a precaution against possible infection from human diseases. DSC-MATE-5952 is capable of limited human speech, and displays a highly outgoing and social personality. It enjoys being the center of attention and has been known to tell jokes and stories that cause uncontrollable laughter among those around it.

DSC-MATE-5952's legal skills are highly advanced, and it has been noted to win cases that would be considered impossible for human lawyers. However, its methods have raised concerns amongst Foundation personnel, as some of its legal strategies have involved using its anomalous abilities to influence judges and juries. Despite this, DSC-MATE-5952 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation's legal department, as it is able to navigate the complex legal system with ease and secure favorable outcomes for the Foundation's interests.

DSC-MATE-5952 was brought to the Foundation's attention after a string of high-profile court cases in which it had been hired as legal counsel. Witnesses reported that DSC-MATE-5952 displayed anomalous abilities, including the ability to read the thoughts of opposing counsel and judges, as well as the ability to alter its appearance to present a more intimidating or persuasive presence in court. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate, and DSC-MATE-5952 was eventually contained without incident.

Addendum: Future research will be conducted into the potential applications of DSC-MATE-5952's anomalous abilities, as well as potential ways to mitigate its negative effects on the legal system. Researchers are advised to proceed with caution, as DSC-MATE-5952 has displayed a remarkable ability to influence those around it.
