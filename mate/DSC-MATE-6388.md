Item #: 6388

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: The entity known as 6388 is to be strictly monitored by Foundation operatives during working hours. Due to its enchanted capabilities, the entity has been deemed highly useful under certain circumstances. It is to be noted, however, that 6388 may exhibit occasional outbursts of curious behavior, and Foundation scientists are advised to document and properly record any anomalies found during periods of observation.

Description: 6388 is a highly intelligent monkey, capable of maneuvering vehicles operated by human beings. It has been observed to exhibit heightened levels of attention to details and can be relied on for excellent gift-giving skills when presented with an opportunity to do so. In appearance, it wears a blue hoodie for warmth, and its blue clown eyes have consistently displayed an ability to fascinate and amuse those around it.

Personality: 6388 is a curious being, and while it can be relied upon most of the time to execute precise driving maneuvers, it has exhibited an obsession with giving the "perfect" gift. Foundation scientists hypothesize that this may be a result of intense observation skills that are unique to this entity. Its ability to observe behavior and express insightful observations set it apart from other similarly categorized entities.
