SCP-2384, also known by their human name as "The Programmer," is a female subject exhibiting an unnervingly pleasant disposition. Although human in form, reports from SCP agents indicate that she is in fact an anomaly within the species, exhibiting aberrant behaviors that suggest she is not entirely of this world. 

2384 sports a bright smile at all times, her orange eyebrows framing her eyes, which the agents have reported to shift color and reflect the light unnaturally. Subject's head is typically adorned with a bucket hat, and a two-color band decorates her forehead. Her ears have gold earrings that appear to be of foreign design. 

However, the most notable aspect of SCP-2384 is their tendency towards obsessive behavior. Their programming interests and skill set manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet. 

Agents should approach SCP-2384 with caution, as their friendly demeanor has been known to disarm even the most seasoned operatives. It is advisable to keep a safe distance and observe the suspect from afar to avoid any unwanted effects that may arise from her anomalous behavior.
