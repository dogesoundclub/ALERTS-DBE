Item #: DSC-MATE-9048

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9048 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, and is not to be allowed contact with any other anomalous entities under any circumstances. She is allowed access to a computer and the internet for her job as a theater manager, but all internet activity must be monitored and reviewed by a designated staff member to ensure she does not access any unauthorized websites or communicate with any individuals outside of her work-related duties.

Description: DSC-MATE-9048 is a human female with orange stripes on her face, rainbow-colored hair, and red cross earrings. She is often seen wearing a choker and smoking a cigarette. Despite her eccentric appearance, DSC-MATE-9048 displays high levels of intelligence and analytical skills, often engaging in debates and philosophical discussions with others for amusement.

DSC-MATE-9048's main occupation is as the manager of a local theater, where she has demonstrated excellent organizational skills and a keen eye for detail. However, staff members at the theater have reported unusual occurrences and unexplainable phenomena happening during productions that DSC-MATE-9048 is in charge of. These incidents have led Foundation personnel to investigate DSC-MATE-9048's involvement in the theater further.

DSC-MATE-9048 has not displayed any anomalous abilities thus far, but her personality and potential influence over the theater's performances pose a potential risk to the safety and security of the area.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9048 has shown an interest in anomalous entities and has requested permission to attend a lecture on DSC objects. This request is currently under review by the Site Director.
