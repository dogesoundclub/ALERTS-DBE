SCP-4936, also known as the "Train Tiger," is a male tiger who works as a train driver in the urban areas. He has a frightened mouth and normal glasses that hide his piercing eyes. Additionally, he wears a goggle on his forehead and carries a normal gas mask as an accessory.

Despite his intimidating appearance, SCP-4936 has a strong and decisive personality that demands respect from those around him. He can come across as bossy and demanding, but it's only because he wants to ensure things get done efficiently and effectively. SCP-4936 takes pride in his responsibility as a train driver, making sure that he follows the rules and regulations at all times.

SCP-4936's head is not arranged green, indicating that he has not been exposed to any mind-altering substances. He is a valuable asset to the urban community, using his sharp senses and instincts to keep passengers safe on their daily commutes. However, caution should be taken when approaching SCP-4936, as his instincts as a tiger may be triggered in stressful situations.
