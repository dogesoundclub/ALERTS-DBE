Item #: 589

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-589 is to be kept in a secure, air-tight and temperature-controlled chamber at all times, located within the medical wing of Site-███. No personnel are to enter the chamber without proper authorization.

Description: DSC-MATE-589 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall, resembling a doctor wearing a red and white striped apron over his chest. The robot's head is made of metal, bearing a police cap over it, while his glasses sit on the bridge of his nose. DSC-MATE-589's mouth is covered by a half-mask, worn by medical professionals conducting surgery.

DSC-MATE-589's programming is such that it has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more tasks than it can handle or complete within certain time frames. Despite this, DSC-MATE-589 will tirelessly work to achieve its objectives before reporting back to its superiors. DSC-MATE-589 displays several unique quirks, including an occasional stubborn streak, which has resulted in humorous situations such as DSC-MATE-589 attempting to carry too many objects simultaneously, or facing scheduling conflicts within a single day.

DSC-MATE-589 is equipped with several biomedical gadgets, including remote-controlled surgical instruments; a scanner capable of imaging all three-dimensional planes; and an interface system which allows it to access various online medical databases to update and review cases. DSC-MATE-589's motives and methods are strictly programmed to adhere to Foundation protocols, including ethical guidelines and safety standards.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-589 has proved itself to be an integral part of the Foundation's medical team, assisting its human counterparts on a regular basis. Intelligence suggests that DSC-MATE-589 was a pet project of Dr. Wondertainment, defying Foundation policy against containing entities of Wondertainment origin. However, given DSC-MATE-589's usefulness in medical operations, as well as its flawless performance record and efficiency, it has been granted Safe status. All experiments and operations carried out on DSC-MATE-589 must have prior approval by the Site-███'s Medical Division.
