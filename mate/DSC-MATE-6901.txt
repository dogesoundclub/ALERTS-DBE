Item #: SCP-6901

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6901 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with no less than two armed guards posted outside at all times. No contact with SCP-6901 is to occur without supervision from Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-6901 is to be provided with a pack of cigarettes on a weekly basis to maintain cooperation.

Description: SCP-6901 appears to be an average human male in his mid-forties, standing at approximately 180cm in height and weighing 90kg. SCP-6901 possesses orange-striped facial features and blue clown eyes, along with a standard blonde mens haircut and a gold earring on his left ear.

SCP-6901 typically wears a silver chain around his neck and is often seen with a cigarette in hand. SCP-6901's personality appears to be driven by a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often leading him to take on more tasks than he can handle. These situations have led to humorous mishaps involving SCP-6901, including attempting to carry too many items at once or failing to complete all tasks in a single day.

SCP-6901's anomalous properties manifest in his ability to manipulate the emotions and decisions of those around him, as well as performing seemingly impossible feats of strength and endurance. SCP-6901's true abilities are currently unknown, and further testing is required to fully understand the extent of its abilities.

Addendum: SCP-6901 was discovered after reports of a car salesman performing otherwise impossible feats of persuasion and salesmanship were received by Foundation agents. After investigation, it was determined that SCP-6901 was the cause of these occurrences and was subsequently contained. Further research is being conducted on SCP-6901's abilities and potential uses for the Foundation.
