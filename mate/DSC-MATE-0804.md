DSC-MATE-804, codenamed "The Obsessive Farmer", is a human female with peculiar physical features. Orange stripes adorn her sharp features while her VR rainbow LED eyes emit an otherworldly glow. Her head is crowned with a wing, further emphasizing her inhuman nature. A single red cross earring dangles from her elongated ears, adding to her mystique. Due to her farming job, she can be seen wearing a medical mask to protect herself from possible plant pathogens.

Despite her supernatural appearance, DSC-MATE-804 harbors an almost compulsive need for order and organization. This idiosyncrasy can manifest in the strangest ways, such as meticulously alphabetizing her spice rack or color-coding her clothes closet. Researchers must take note that disruptions to her structured environment can lead to high levels of anxiety and stress.

Observation of her interactions with other individuals reveal her to be passive-aggressive, often responding with terse monosyllables if her routine is interrupted. However, behind her obsessive behavior, DSC-MATE-804 appears to harbor strong emotions, with her gold chain serving as the only link to her past life.

Under no circumstances should physical contact be allowed, as it may trigger violent reactions from DSC-MATE-804. Access to her quarters is limited to authorized personnel only, with all interactions to be recorded and analyzed post-observation.
