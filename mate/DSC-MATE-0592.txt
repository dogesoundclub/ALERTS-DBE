SCP-592 wears a blue bandana on his head and has a goggle on his forehead. SCP-592's ears are pierced, and he wears a jade earring, a gold chain, and a candy stick as accessories.

SCP-592 is a highly intelligent and curious individual, with a thirst for knowledge that drives him to study and research obscure topics. SCP-592 has a large collection of books, documentaries, and other educational materials, which he enjoys sharing with others. SCP-592 is highly sociable and enjoys conversing with individuals, often engaging in philosophical or intellectual debates.

SCP-592 is also capable of producing and controlling fire, a highly dangerous ability that increases SCP-592's risk level.

It is highly recommended that SCP-592 be approached with caution and only with approved testing measures in place.

Addendum:

SCP-592 was discovered during an investigation into a series of unexplained fires that occurred in a local city. SCP-592, who was working at the time as a firefighter, was the only survivor of the fires and was taken into Foundation custody for further study. SCP-592's abilities and unique personality made him an ideal candidate for containment and study, and he continues to provide valuable insights into the world of obscure knowledge and the nature of fire.
