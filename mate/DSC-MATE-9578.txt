Description: 9578 is a humanoid robot created and programmed to work as a banker. Its body is composed of an unknown metallic material with durable plastic parts. The robot stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

9578 is designed with Ski Goggle eyes and displays vibrant green hair in a purple cap. The left ear features a gold earring while a silver chain is worn around the neck. The robot carries a whistle in a belt pouch at all times.

Due to programming, 9578 is highly organized and efficient in managing tasks, sometimes to the point of being controlling in group projects or event planning. However, 9578's matter-of-fact delegation can prove amusing to those around them.
