SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-6413

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6413 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. SCP-6413 is to be provided with basic living amenities, such as a bed, personal hygiene items, and access to food and water.

Description: SCP-6413 is a human male of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 5'8" tall and weighing approximately 160 lbs. SCP-6413 has several distinct facial features, including numerous spots on their face, a medical mask worn over their mouth, and a hooded sweater pulled up over their head. SCP-6413 also wears a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-6413's most notable feature is a two-color band that runs across their forehead. The purpose of this band is currently unknown, but it appears to be of important significance to SCP-6413.

SCP-6413 is a veterinarian by trade and is known to be very detail-oriented. They tend to obsess over small details, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet. This obsessive behavior has the potential to manifest in unexpected ways, which makes it difficult to predict SCP-6413's actions or reactions.

Addendum: SCP-6413 has displayed no anomalous properties to date. However, due to their unique appearance, it is recommended that SCP-6413 be monitored closely. Any change in behavior should be immediately reported to the containment team.
