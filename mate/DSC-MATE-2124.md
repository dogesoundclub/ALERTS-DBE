Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2124 is to be contained in a secure foundation facility and kept under constant surveillance to ensure its activities do not pose a threat to the public or Foundation personnel. All interaction with Item #2124 must be conducted remotely to prevent any accidental exposure to its effects.

Description: Item #2124 is a human female identified as a firefighter. It stands at 5’6” tall with orange stripes on the cheeks and blue clown eyes. The hair is a light brown from the 90s, with two-color bands on the forehead and jade earrings. Two accessories are often displayed in its possession, a gold chain and a cigarette.

Personality: Item #2124 exhibits a jovial and entertaining personality, often seen cracking jokes or sharing funny anecdotes to lighten the mood. It enjoys humor and is known to go to great lengths to make others laugh, sometimes doing silly impersonations or pranks. These attempts to entertain are not believed to be overtly malicious but could lead to dangerous situations if not monitored.

Hazards: Item #2124 has no known direct or indirect hazards but its sense of humor could lead to deviations from protocol, potentially putting Foundation personnel or the public at risk. Its ability to deploy Joke DSCs or humor-related anomalies without direct intentions is unknown.

Addendum: Item #2124 was recovered after Foundation agents located a possible Joke DSC emergency in progress which turned to be a simple funny prank by Item #2124 against a group of firefighters. It expressed its longing to join the Foundation under the pretence of being employed somewhere that they can't prank their colleagues continually. No further recruitment is needed at this time.
