Item #: SCP-8366

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8366 is to be kept in a secure enclosure with appropriate food and water provisions. All interaction with SCP-8366 must be done remotely through a communication device placed within the enclosure. Personnel may not enter SCP-8366's enclosure without proper safety equipment and a tranquilizer rifle.

Description: SCP-8366 appears to be a male rabbit of the Leporidae family. It stands at approximately 50cm tall and weighs 3.5kg. SCP-8366 is known to display a constant state of fear, characterized by a permanently widened mouth. It is often seen wearing a hoodie with a red scarf draped around its neck.

SCP-8366 is known to wear a gas mask at all times, with normal glasses covering its eyes. It can breathe without it, but insists on wearing the gas mask for unknown reasons. SCP-8366 also sports a distinctive feature on its forehead, consisting of a 2-color band that appears to be made of fabric.

Despite SCP-8366's fearful demeanor, it displays a deep empathy and understanding for others. When witnessing pain or suffering, SCP-8366 may become emotional, leading to tears or outbursts. This empathy appears to extend to animals and nature as well.

SCP-8366's occupation prior to containment was that of a veterinarian, suggesting a fondness for animals. However, further observation is necessary to determine any notable effect on SCP-8366's behavior.

Addendum 8366-1: SCP-8366 was recovered from a rural town in ████████, after several reports of a "talking rabbit" surfaced. Field agents discovered SCP-8366 living alone in a secluded area, wearing its gas mask and hoodie. It was tranquilized and brought into Foundation custody. Further investigation into SCP-8366's origins is ongoing.
