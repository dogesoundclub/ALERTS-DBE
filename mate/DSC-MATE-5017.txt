Object Class: Euclid  

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5017 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with reinforced walls able to withstand significant explosions or blasts. Access to SCP-5017 is strictly prohibited without Level 4 clearance, and all personnel should be checked for any electronic devices before entering the containment chamber.

Description: SCP-5017 is a robotic villain, modelled after a humanoid figure, approximately 1.9 meters tall. SCP-5017's head is composed of a red alarm, featuring a single green cyclops eye and a mouth that appears to express fear. SCP-5017's eyes are protected by what appear to be nerd glasses, and its ears are decorated with a jade earring. SCP-5017 wears a red scarf and an LED gas mask as its accessories.

SCP-5017's sentient AI has a passion for adventure and takes risks, often leading to comedic escapades, including surviving near-death experiences and getting lost in the wilderness. SCP-5017's love of adventure often leads to it undertaking missions that are beyond its abilities, which can pose a severe threat to itself and others. 

It is important to note that SCP-5017's capacity for destruction poses a considerable risk to the Foundation, and its containment must be maintained at all times to prevent unauthorized access or security breaches.
