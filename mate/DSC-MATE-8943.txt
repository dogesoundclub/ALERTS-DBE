SCP Foundation Description for 8943 "The Idealistic Politician":

SCP-8943 is a humanoid creature identified as a human politician. He wears a retro cap adorned with orange stripes and a gold earring on his right ear. Its neck is adorned with a red scarf, possibly as a symbol of its political ideals. SCP-8943 shows a highly idealistic personality, characterized by an intense desire to make the world a better place.

SCP-8943's idealism creates situations that are both comical and helpful in urban situations. It has been known to protest and boycott entities that it believes are against its values, leading to significant attention and changes.

Attempts at containing SCP-8943 are ongoing but has been difficult as it often bargains and compromises with its captors to further its goals. This behaviour may be considered both beneficial and dubious as SCP-8943 can use its within the Foundation to pursue its campaign of change.

Caution must be taken when handling SCP-8943 as it has been observed smoking in the containment chamber. As smoking is strictly prohibited within the facility, it is under strict supervision of nurses and medical professionals.

In conclusion, SCP Foundation would advise that any contact with SCP-8943 be handled with caution to prevent any compromise of our security protocols while also ensuring containment standards are adhered to.
