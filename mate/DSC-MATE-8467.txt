Item #: SCP-8467

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8467 is allowed to continue with its profession as a reporter but must be monitored for any potential to divulge Foundation secrets to the public. SCP-8467 must be kept away from confidential information and is not allowed any contact with SCP objects.

Description: SCP-8467 is a male human who possesses unusual physical characteristics. The individual has orange stripes on their face, further accentuated with VR Rainbow LED eyes. SCP-8467 is often seen wearing a blue bandana on their head, paired with a green cross earring on one ear, and always has a cigarette in their hand.

SCP-8467 is known for their charismatic personality, particularly when it comes to connecting with others on a deep level. They possess an ability to get people to open up about their lives, and they can seemingly create a bond with anyone they encounter. Their talent in storytelling and ability to make people laugh often equals a funny anecdote resulting in people becoming closer together. They are often considered quite likable and are always willing to help others or lend an ear to anyone who needs one.

It should be noted that SCP-8467's natural charm may pose a threat to the containment of SCP objects, especially when their exceptional persuasive skills and persuasive speaking talents are at play. It is recommended that SCP-8467's interaction with SCPs is kept on a need-to-know basis only to reduce the risk of a containment breach. 

Addendum: Dr. ███████ has recommended that a psychological analysis be conducted to determine the full extent of SCP-8467's anomalous qualities. Until this information is gathered, it is recommended that SCP-8467 should be treated with caution.
