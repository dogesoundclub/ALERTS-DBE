Item #: 2165

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2165 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Basic amenities such as hygiene and food are to be provided by personnel. SCP-2165 is only allowed to leave its containment unit for scheduled medical checkups and specialized equipment modifications.

Description: SCP-2165 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. The subject is a firefighter by profession and is roughly 1.8 meters in height. The subject possesses distinctive orange stripes on its face, which contrast against blue clown eyes. A police cap can be observed on the subject's head, with a red victory band at the forehead. SCP-2165 wears a gold chain and carries a candy stick as accessories.

SCP-2165 exhibits a jovial personality with a great sense of humor. It is often observed telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to entertain itself and others. Such behaviors can have both positive and negative effects on SCP-2165's mental state. In rare instances, SCP-2165 has displayed unusual behavior towards its candy stick, causing it to violently lash out at personnel. SCP-2165's reaction to its candy stick is currently under investigation.

Addendum 2165-A:
SCP-2165 was recovered in a commercial building during a standard firefighting operation in ██████, Canada. Incident reports indicate that SCP-2165 showed exceptional maneuverability and strength, contributing significantly to the successful containment of the flames. After the firefighting operation, SCP-2165's unusual physical appearance was noted by local authorities; Foundation personnel were notified and recovered SCP-2165 shortly thereafter.

Addendum 2165-B:
Through specialized equipment modifications, it has been discovered that SCP-2165's clown eyes contain an as-yet-unknown substance that causes extreme euphoria in human subjects who gaze upon them for a prolonged period. All personnel interacting with SCP-2165 should take necessary precautions to avoid staring directly into SCP-2165's eyes for an extended duration.

Evaluation: SCP-2165 has exhibited no anomalous abilities thus far, and its physical appearance reduces its chances of noticeable alterations in society. Its containment class can be further reconsidered after thorough analysis of its interactions with its candy stick. SCP-2165's cooperation with Foundation personnel is commendable.
