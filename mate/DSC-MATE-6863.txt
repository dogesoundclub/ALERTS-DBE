Item #: SCP-6863

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6863 is to be kept in a secure containment facility and monitored at all times. Personnel are advised to refrain from making direct eye contact with SCP-6863, as its Ski Goggle eyes have been known to trigger an aggressive response. Any interaction with SCP-6863 must be done with caution and limited to individuals with Level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-6863 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 8 feet tall and weighing around 400 pounds. Its face features a perpetually frightened mouth and a medical mask, which covers the bottom half of its face at all times. SCP-6863's unusual appearance is further enhanced by the presence of a Red Cross Earring on its left ear.

SCP-6863 exhibits an extremely organized and efficient personality, often taking charge of group projects and delegating tasks in a very matter-of-fact manner. This controlling behavior is a result of SCP-6863's captivity and is not considered a part of its natural personality. Nevertheless, it is advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-6863, as its controlling tendencies could lead to inadvertent harm.

SCP-6863's mechanical skills are exceptional and the Foundation has enlisted its services as a mechanic. However, its work must be monitored closely to ensure its containment cell and all other Foundation properties remain secure.

SCP-6863's behavior can be unpredictable at times, particularly when it perceives a threat to its territorial boundaries. It will display aggressive behavior towards anything that it perceives as a threat, particularly towards individuals who make direct eye contact with it. As such, it is recommended that SCP-6863's containment cell is kept out of direct view of surveillance cameras to prevent triggering an aggressive response.

Addendum: SCP-6863 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, and its mechanical skills have been instrumental in the maintenance and repair of Foundation property. However, its behavior must be monitored closely, and any deviations from its usual behavior must be reported immediately to senior personnel.
