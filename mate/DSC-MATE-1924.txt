Item #: 1924

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1924 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times for their own safety and the safety of others. They must be provided with regular mechanical maintenance to ensure that their cybernetic enhancements remain in good working order. Interaction with 1924 should be kept to a minimum as their tendency towards reckless behavior can pose a threat to staff.

Description: Subject 1924 appears to be a human female with distinctive spots on their face and a contagious smile. Their eyes are cybernetic in nature, replacing natural eyes with VR Jade LEDs. Subject 1924 can often be seen sporting a retro cap with a goggle on her forehead, along with a jade earring and a gold chain. They also wear an LED gas mask when working on mechanical equipment.

Subject 1924 is a skilled mechanic but can be a liability due to her reckless behavior. They tend to act on impulse without thinking things through, which has led to several minor accidents and mishaps in the past. Despite this, they have a friendly nature and enjoy showing off their skills to others.

Addendum: Subject 1924 has been observed attempting to modify both their mechanical enhancements and those of other SCPs within the facility. All modification attempts must be reported and monitored closely.
