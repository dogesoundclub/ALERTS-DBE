Item #: 3524

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3524 is to be contained in an individual cage at Site-███. Personnel are to strictly follow the protocol for feeding and caretaking, as the subject is a sentient being, and therefore, above all considered sentient. Any interaction with the subject must be performed under the supervision of a Class A or higher personnel. Access to Subject 3524 is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Description: Subject 3524 is a four-legged, apex predator of the Panthera tigris subspecies. The subject manifests nearly human-level intelligence and capacity to emote, which are common traits among "anthropomorphic" strains of urban-dwelling cryptids. The subject manifests an anomalous property to cleverly conceal itself from nearby perception despite its large, imposing size. The subject is observed to be able to manifest complex thoughts and even communicate in human speech, with one language specializing in English.

Subject 3524 fur is primarily ash-colored, with whitish-gray stripes. Its eyes and claws resemble those of a regular tiger, except for a bizarre jaw that appears to portray a constant frightened expression, whether or not the subject is in that emotional state.

Subject 3524 personality is highly organized and oddly centered around a set routine. However, it also bears an unusually spontaneous streak that can lead to humorous situations. Many unwitting acquaintances have reported the subject to be highly creative when it comes to party planning, often with a surprising degree of success.

Addendum 3524-A: Confidential Files

Subject 3524 is officially recognized by some as "Doctor." It has a strange penchant for human medical operations that appear to have surpassed armchair neurosurgical fantasies. Its methods are highly unorthodox, and if not for its status as a cryptid, may have been labeled a rogue beyond restraint by regulatory medical boards.

The Foundation has provided subject 3524 limited access to medical equipment under highly monitored special permission to perform its practices. Whether this engagement is an opportunity to study this unique aspect of DSC-MATE-3524 or offer any medically relevant findings, remains to be seen.
