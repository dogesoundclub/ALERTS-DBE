SCP-3338 appears to be a male monkey of an unknown species. SCP-3338 stands approximately 1 meter tall and weighs around 20 kg.

SCP-3338's hobbies may include creating intricate cosplay costumes, writing emotional poetry, and collecting peculiar objects. Additionally, SCP-3338 has demonstrated a high level of anxiety and fear.

SCP-3338's anomalous characteristics appear to stem from its species, but the full extent of its abilities remains unknown. SCP-3338 has the ability to warp its surrounding reality, causing odd occurrences and atmospheric changes.
