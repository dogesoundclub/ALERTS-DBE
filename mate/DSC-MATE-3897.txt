Item #: SCP-3897

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3897 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell fitted with a high-strength locking system. No personnel are to touch SCP-3897 without full PPE and scheduled vaccinations. To maintain containment, all power outlets and cords in SCP-3897’s room are to be disconnected and removed. SCP-3897 has expressed a preference for smoking, and is to be allowed to smoke one cigarette per day as a reward for good behavior.

Description: SCP-3897 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing at 142 cm in height and weighing 73 kg. SCP-3897’s anomalous abilities include heightened agility, strength, and resistance to heat, making it a proficient firefighter. SCP-3897 is identifiable by its blue clown eyes and green, unarranged fur. SCP-3897 wears a jade earring and silver chain as accessories.

SCP-3897 is an independent creature and may not respond well to authority, often disregarding unnecessary rules or directives. This can lead SCP-3897 to display rebellious behavior, such as leaving the site early or taking unscheduled breaks. SCP-3897 is highly skilled in firefighting techniques and often takes the lead in complex or dangerous situations.

Addendum: SCP-3897 has expressed dissatisfaction with current containment procedures and has negotiated a new reward system with personnel. In exchange for cooperative behavior, SCP-3897 will be permitted to smoke one cigarette per day. Personnel should note that denying SCP-3897 its reward may lead to further rebellious behavior.
