Item #: SCP-5424

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5424 is to be contained in a soundproof chamber, located on a designated farm owned by the Foundation. The chamber is to have access to natural sunlight, food and water supplies, and surveillance cameras. Any interaction with SCP-5424 must be conducted through a designated interface, and physical contact is prohibited.

Description: SCP-5424 is a mature male monkey, known to the Foundation as a farmer. SCP-5424's face features include a constant frightened expression, with shade glasses covering its eyes. Its head is adorned with normal black hair and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-5424 also wears a red scarf as its accessory.

SCP-5424 displays a peculiar personality, characterized by excessive curiosity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. It is known for spending considerable amounts of time reading, researching, and collecting educational materials. SCP-5424 is very passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with anyone willing to listen.

SCP-5424 has not demonstrated any hostile behavior towards Foundation staff or other SCPs, but is known to show aggression when defending its property or crops. It is also capable of communicating in sign language, but any attempt to use it as a translator or messenger must be authorized.

Addendum: SCP-5424 was discovered after reports of a "talking monkey" circulated in the town neighboring its farm. At first, people believed it was a hoax or a circus act, but Foundation agents confirmed its existence and contained it for study. SCP-5424's curious nature makes it an ideal candidate for research and development of educational programs for SCP containment procedures.
