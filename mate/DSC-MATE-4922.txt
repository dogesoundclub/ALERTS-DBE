SCP-4922, also known as "The Don," is a notorious Mafia boss operating within the city limits. He stands at a height of 6'2" and weighs approximately 220 pounds. His most distinguishing feature is the pair of black ski goggles he wears over his eyes at all times, rendering his gaze unreadable.

SCP-4922's head is adorned with a blue bandana, signifying his allegiance to his gang. He sports a gold earring on his right earlobe, a mark of his status within the organization. Wrapped around his neck is a bright red scarf, adding a splash of color to his otherwise nondescript attire. He frequently sucks on a candy stick, a habit that is both endearing and unnerving at the same time.

Despite his rough exterior, SCP-4922 possesses a powerful intuition that borders on psychic ability. He seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to reading people and situations, often predicting events before they occur. He is adept at sensing when someone is upset or anxious, and uses this ability to gain an advantage over his enemies.

Approaching SCP-4922 is not recommended unless you have strict instructions to do so. He is highly dangerous, and his gang is known to use brutal tactics to maintain control over their territories. SCP-4922 is a force to be reckoned with, and is not to be underestimated.
