Item #: DSC-MATE-3254

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3254 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a high-security lock to prevent unauthorized access. All personnel entering DSC-MATE-3254â€™s containment chamber must wear full-body protective gear and a gas mask due to its anomalous properties. Under no circumstances should any personnel attempt to remove any of DSC-MATE-3254's accessories, as it has been observed to become highly aggressive when these items are threatened.

Description: DSC-MATE-3254 appears to be a male human with distinctive facial features. The subject has orange stripes painted on its face, which are visible even through its gas mask. DSC-MATE-3254 also has a clown mouth painted on its face, and its eyes are red with enlarged pupils resembling those of a clown.

DSC-MATE-3254 is often seen wearing a doge hat and green cross earring on its left ear, and has been observed wearing a gold chain necklace. The subject also wears a normal gas mask to obscure its face, although this does not impede its ability to perceive its surroundings.

DSC-MATE-3254's most notable trait is its sense of humor, which seems to be the primary motivator for its actions. The subject frequently attempts to make others laugh by telling jokes and performing silly impersonations. However, when provoked or threatened, DSC-MATE-3254 has been observed to become extremely violent, using its anomalous abilities to manipulate objects and cause destruction.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3254's anomalous abilities appear to be related to its clown-like appearance and behavior. It has been observed to manipulate nearby objects telekinetically, often levitating them and hurling them at any perceived threats. DSC-MATE-3254 has also demonstrated the ability to create small explosions and electrical discharges at will, leading to significant damage to its containment chamber during tantrums. Due to its dangerous abilities and unpredictable behavior, all personnel should exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-3254.
