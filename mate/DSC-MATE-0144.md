Subject 144, codenamed "Striped Protector," is a human female with striking features that set her apart from the rest. Her face bears distinctive orange stripes that run down from her forehead to her cheeks, perfectly complementing her purple lipstick. Her fierce gaze is further accentuated by her orange eyebrow that seems to radiate an inner fire.

Her head is adorned with hair that is not arranged in the conventional sense; it is wild and free like a forest untouched. Her red cross earring is an odd addition that catches the eye and speaks to a deeper meaning hidden behind her facade.

She is often seen wearing a choker around her neck, signifying her sense of fashion and an unspoken elegance that she carries around with ease. A cigarette hangs casually from her lips, adding to her enigmatic personality that many find irresistible.

Striped Protector may have a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, but her loyalty and protectiveness towards her loved ones are unmatched. She is not afraid to confront anyone who dares to insult or harm her friends and family, causing some humorous situations to arise.

As a security guard, she brings the same level of dedication and protection to her job, keeping watch over the people and places she has sworn to protect. Her presence is both reassuring and intimidating, a testament to her formidable abilities and an asset to any team she is a part of. Any who cross her will learn the true meaning of her name, and her stripes will serve as a warning to those who dare to challenge her.
