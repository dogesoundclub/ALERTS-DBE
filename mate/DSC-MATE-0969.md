DogeSoundClub Description for Officer 969:

Item #969: The Jester Cop
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 969 is to be kept under constant surveillance at all times by at least two Level 2 guards. He is to be provided with a standard-issue firearm without ammunition. Testing of his reality-altering properties can only be carried out with the approval of two Level 4 personnel.

Description: Officer 969 is a male human police officer with a unique appearance. He is easily recognizable by his orange striped facial features and red clown eyes that gleam in the dark. His head bears a strange, green hairdo that is never seen arranged.

Subject's personality is that of a jester, with a great sense of humor, even in stressful situations. DSC-MATE-969's humor often borders on the absurd, resulting in unexpected behavior that can turn dark or bizarre. The subject has an inclination for bright, eye-catching clothes that often have additional design elements to reflect his sense of humor.

The subject has reality-altering properties that manifest when they are in a state of fear or emotional distress. The effects are random and varied but often result in the materialization of surreal elements in the environment, such as the appearance of clowns and cartoon-like characters. The subject's abilities have not yet been completely understood.

DSC-MATE-969 has an earring, which appears to be made of gold, on his right ear. The ring was found to be indestructible and unaffected by DSC-MATE-969's reality-warping abilities.

Personnel are reminded that DSC-MATE-969's jokester persona is for entertainment purposes only and must not be encouraged. He should be approached with caution and handled appropriately, considering his abnormal abilities.
