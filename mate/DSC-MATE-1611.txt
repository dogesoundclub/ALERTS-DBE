SCP-1611 is capable of speech in multiple languages and claims to be a politician on its home world. Its personality traits are scattered, and its tendency to forget things or become sidetracked has led to some humorous situations. However, SCP-1611 also exhibits a dangerous nature when it is angered or feels threatened.

SCP-1611 has been known to exhibit temporary shapeshifting abilities, taking on the traits and abilities of creatures it comes into contact with. This has led to concerns regarding SCP-1611's possible connections to other supernatural entities within our world.

Addendum: SCP-1611's presence on our world is currently unexplained, and further investigation is needed to determine its origins and motivations. Until then, SCP-1611 is to be treated with caution and closely monitored.
