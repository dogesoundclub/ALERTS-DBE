Item #: SCP-3854

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3854 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-3854 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. SCP-3854 is not to leave its cell without proper authorization and escort. Any requests made by SCP-3854 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. 

Description: SCP-3854 is a sentient tiger of the Bengal subspecies, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall when bipedal. SCP-3854 possesses cybernetic enhancements, including jade LED eyes, a gas mask that can be turned on and off, and a red scarf. SCP-3854's head is adorned with green hair and a purple cap. The enhancements are hypothesized to have been self-installed by SCP-3854, as the methods and materials used are not commonly found in standard cybernetics. 

SCP-3854 possesses a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help, even when they need it. This behavior has led to some humorous situations and also puts SCP-3854 at risk. Despite this, SCP-3854 has shown to be highly intelligent, with capabilities in programming that surpass many human counterparts. 

SCP-3854 was discovered in a small suburban town after it broke into a technology company's building and stole advanced hardware. Foundation agents were dispatched, and SCP-3854 was apprehended without incident. SCP-3854 has since complied with Foundation procedures and has shown no signs of aggression. 

Addendum: It has come to the attention of Foundation researchers that SCP-3854 has been communicating with subjects outside of containment via encrypted messages. The messages have yet to be deciphered, and SCP-3854 has refused to disclose any information regarding their content. Further investigation is ongoing.
