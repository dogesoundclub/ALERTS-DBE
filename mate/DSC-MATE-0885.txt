SCP Foundation Description
Item #: SCP-885

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-885 is to be kept in a standard containment cell, with walls and floors made of reinforced steel. The cell must be equipped with infrared heat sensors, as SCP-885 requires a warm environment to prevent discomfort and potential aggression. Additionally, regular psychological evaluations are to be conducted by qualified personnel.

Description: SCP-885 is a male tiger, measuring approximately 2.5 meters in length with distinctive ski goggle-like eyes and a disarranged green head fur. SCP-885 is always seen wearing a red scarf and a gold earring in its left ear. Its mouth is typically seen in a frightened expression, but it is capable of emoting a wide range of expressions.

SCP-885 is notable for its unique personality. Despite being a fierce predator, it possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, most likely stemming from its previous profession as a lawyer. SCP-885 is incredibly intelligent, with a keen grasp of human behavior and psychology. However, it can also be playful and enjoys engaging in activities such as dancing and singing with people.

SCP-885's playful nature can lead to dangerous situations, as it tends to let down its guard when engaged in activities it enjoys. As a result, SCP-885's containment procedures must be followed strictly, and personnel must always be cautious when engaging with SCP-885.

Addendum: SCP-885 has a preference for hip-hop and pop music and will often request to have songs played during its interactions with personnel. Its favorite artists include Beyonc√© and Kendrick Lamar.
