Item #: 2906

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2906 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, with strict surveillance via CCTV. Subject is to be provided with a regular diet of live prey and is to be kept in a subdued environment that mimics their natural habitat as closely as possible.

Description: Subject 2906 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 7 feet in height and weighing roughly 400 pounds. They possess distinct physical traits, such as nerd glasses over their piercing green eyes and a red cross earring in their left earlobe.

Subject appears to possess typical tiger-like behavior, preferring to spend time stalking their prey and lounging in the sun. However, their personality can be a cause for concern, as they have demonstrated a rebellious streak that borders on insubordination. Despite this, they have been observed to be highly intelligent, capable of using tools and even figuring out how to open locked doors.

Subject currently works as a fast food worker and has expressed their enjoyment of pushing boundaries, often breaking rules and bending them just for the sake of curiosity. Although this behavior may appear harmless, it is recommended that all interactions with subject be conducted with caution.

Addendum: Following a recent escape attempt, it has been recommended that subject 2906's containment chamber be reinforced with additional security measures. All staff handling the subject are to be briefed on proper safety protocols and instructed to refrain from provoking the subject in any way. Any incidents involving subject 2906 are to be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities.
