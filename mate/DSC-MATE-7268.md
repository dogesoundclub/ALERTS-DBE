Item #: 7268

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7268 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit with appropriate enrichment toys, exercise equipment, and a specially designed feeding system that mimics their natural habitat. 7268 is allowed outside of their containment unit for a maximum of two hours per day to conduct routine security checks around the facility.

Description: 7268 is a male monkey species employed as a security guard. They stand at approximately 4 feet tall, with green hair tucked under a purple cap. They display a frightened mouth at all times, with normal eyes behind thick glasses, and wear a jade earring in their right ear. Additional features include a silver chain around their neck and a whistle on a chain, both of which they carry with them at all times.

Personality: 7268 is a bit of an absent-minded character and can be forgetful at times, especially when they are lost in thought or working on a project. They have a tendency to get sidetracked and lose track of time, which can lead to missed appointments or important events. Despite this, 7268 is a dedicated and reliable worker, always focused on maintaining the safety and security of the facility they are assigned to. 

Although they appear timid and easily intimidated, 7268 exhibits exceptional bravery in emergency situations, willing to put themselves in harm's way to protect their charges. Their docile demeanor has made them popular with fellow staff, animal and otherwise, and their hard work and dedication to duty have earned them a position of trust within this facility.
