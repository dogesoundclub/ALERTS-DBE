Item #: 8500

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 8500 is a normal human being with no anomalous properties. She is to be monitored like any other civilian and must obey all traffic laws.

Description: 8500 is a female traffic officer of average height and build. She has green hair, which she often wears in a purple cap, and a smile that can be disarming. On her forehead, she always wears a pair of goggles and has a red cross earring on each ear. Additionally, she carries a gold chain and a cigarette as her accessories.

Despite her non-anomalous appearance, 8500's personality can be daunting. She comes across as bossy and intimidating because she has a strong and decisive personality. 8500 is always striving to make sure that things are done efficiently and effectively. This can be mistaken for aggressiveness or intimidation, but it is just because she takes her job very seriously and wants to make sure everyone follows the traffic laws.

Addendum: 8500 has no known connections to any anomalous or supernatural entities. She is just a competent traffic officer, and any reports otherwise are to be disregarded.

As of now, she poses no threat to the safety of civilians or the SCP Foundation.
