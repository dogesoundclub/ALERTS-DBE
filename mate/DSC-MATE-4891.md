Item #: 4891

Object Class: Euclid

Profile: Subject 4891 is a male tiger, working as a delivery driver in the metropolitan area. He displays an unnerving set of blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth, suggesting mild anxiety or emotional turmoil. Subject's head is often adorned with a headset equipped with LED lights, making him easily identifiable within his work environment. 

Subject is observed to have a penchant for flamboyant accessories, usually in the form of a gold chain worn around the neck. This may indicate a desire for attention and self-expression, further evidenced by his vivid imagination and creative spirit. Subject appears to be fond of hobbies that embrace this trait, such as poetry, cosplay, and collecting eclectic items.

However, it is to be noted that Subject may become unpredictable and potentially dangerous if threatened or provoked. It is advised that all interactions should be conducted with appropriate caution and vigilance, and that Subject should be monitored closely for any signs of aberrant behavior.
