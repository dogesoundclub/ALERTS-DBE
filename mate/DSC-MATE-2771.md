Item #: 2771

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2771 is to be kept under close observation at all times, and is not to be allowed contact with anyone outside of Foundation personnel without prior approval from at least two Level 4 personnel. Subject is currently held in a reinforced containment chamber lined with steel plating, with an observation window allowing for visual monitoring at all times. 

Description: Subject 2771 appears to be a male Siberian Tiger, standing at approximately 6 feet in height and weighing over 500 pounds. Despite his intimidating appearance, he presents a surprisingly relaxed and laid-back disposition, often approaching his handlers with an almost playful attitude. 

Subject exhibits two distinct facial features - a slightly open mouth, which appears to indicate a sense of perpetual fright, and a two color band across his forehead which gives him an almost tribal appearance. He also sports a pair of normal glasses, presumably for reading, and a single gold earring in his right ear.

Personality: Despite a generally peaceful disposition, Subject 2771 has demonstrated an almost unyielding loyalty to those he considers friends or loved ones. This has led to several comical incidents, including heated confrontations with individuals who insult or belittle those he has taken a liking to. 

Subjects are also highly intelligent, and show a remarkable understanding of language, often attempting to converse with handlers and researchers using a wide variety of vocalizations and gestures. 

Overall, 2771 is considered to be a highly unpredictable and potentially volatile entity, and as such should be approached with caution at all times. Any attempts to provoke or entice the subject should be avoided, as it could lead to serious injury or even death.
