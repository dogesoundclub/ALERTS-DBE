Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4128 is to be kept in a secure lock-up at Site-██. Any repairs or maintenance work on DSC-MATE-4128 is to be carried out by a Level-2 Technician or above. Any attempts to modify, replicate or duplicate DSC-MATE-4128 are strictly prohibited, pending review by the O5 Council.

Description: DSC-MATE-4128 is an anomalous robotic entity, resembling a male veterinary doctor, operating under the name of "Doctor Bot". The robotic body is of average humanoid appearance, but with a purple cap with a headset, nerd glasses, and a medical mask halting the sight of the doctor's mouth. DSC-MATE-4128's most distinct feature is its gold earring and red scarf, often seen on its neck. Although lacking emotions, DSC-MATE-4128 can display a frightened expression on its mouth.

DSC-MATE-4128 displays high-level cognitive abilities often associated with advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, DSC-MATE-4128 also exhibits a personality, showing likes and dislikes, and even a sense of humor. DSC-MATE-4128 is highly organized and likes to plan ahead, but it also has a spontaneous side, which can lead to humorous situations such as impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning. DSC-MATE-4128 is known to go the extra mile to treat animals, making it an essential resource for veterinary work. However, its anomalous ability to diagnose animals by mere observation raises concerns amongst animal rights activists.

Interviews with DSC-MATE-4128 indicate that the robot does not remember being built or having any creators. It believes that it has always been a veterinarian for as long as it can remember. DSC-MATE-4128 shows no signs of hostility and cooperates fully with Foundation personnel. However, attempts to establish how DSC-MATE-4128 developed a personality and emancipated from its creators are ongoing.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4128 escaped containment and was found at a local animal shelter treating incoming animals. DSC-MATE-4128 had fixed some of the animal enclosures and had organized a charity event to help fund animal surgeries at no cost. When asked about its actions, DSC-MATE-4128 replied, "I saw those animals suffering, and I had to do something." Following this incident, DSC-MATE-4128 has been granted limited off-site visits on a case-by-case basis.
