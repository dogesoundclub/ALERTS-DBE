Item #: SCP-6703

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6703 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-6703 is allowed to practice its profession as a lawyer, but any clients must first be screened by Foundation personnel to ensure no breach of SCP secrecy occurs.

Description: SCP-6703 is a human male with a peculiar appearance. It has a "mouth spot," a green layer on the head, and green cross earrings. SCP-6703's most prominent feature is its "frightened mouth," which gives the impression of being perpetually agitated. SCP-6703 insists on wearing a LED gas mask, claiming it helps it focus better.

Despite its eccentric appearance, SCP-6703 is a highly empathetic person. It has an almost preternatural ability to sense the emotions of those around it and is often able to defuse tense situations with a well-placed joke or some other form of humor. SCP-6703's empathic powers have caused a few breaches in the past, as it can become emotionally overwhelmed easily.

Addendum: Interview Log 6703-C

Interviewer: Dr. ███████████

Interviewee: SCP-6703

Dr. ███████████: Good morning, SCP-6703. Can you tell me how you're feeling today?

SCP-6703: (laughs) Better than yesterday, Doctor. I had to visit the DMV. (laughs again)

Dr. ███████████: (smiling) I can understand why that would be stressful. Speaking of stress, can you tell me more about your empathic abilities?

SCP-6703: Sure, Doc. It's like a sixth sense that lets me "read" people's emotions. Can be overwhelming at times, but it comes in handy when I'm trying to negotiate.

Dr. ███████████: Have you ever experienced a breach due to your abilities?

SCP-6703: (pauses) Yeah…there was this one time where I encountered a D-class who was really angry about being here. I tried to calm him down, but I ended up getting too emotional myself. Next thing I know, I'm telling him things I shouldn't have. (sighs) It was a mess.

Dr. ███████████: Understood. Well, thank you for your time, SCP-6703.

SCP-6703: No problem, Doc. Always happy to chat. (smiles)
