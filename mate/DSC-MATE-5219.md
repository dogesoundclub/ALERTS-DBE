Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5219 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be furnished with a library of books, reference materials, and technological equipment to facilitate the subject's work as a programmer. The chamber must also contain a sufficient amount of carrots as a dietary supplement for the subject.

Description: DSC-MATE-5219 is a rabbit of indeterminate breed with blue clown eyes. The subject appears to be sentient and possesses humanoid-level intelligence. DSC-MATE-5219 is capable of speech, although it has a tendency to speak in a low, monotone voice. The subject is well-versed in various programming languages and spends most of its time reading and researching obscure topics related to computer science and technology.

DSC-MATE-5219 is often observed wearing a hoodie and a silver chain around its neck. The subject carries a whistle with it at all times, although its purpose and significance are currently unknown.

The subject spends hours reading and researching various topics, ranging from AI programming to the history of the internet. DSC-MATE-5219 is highly curious and inquisitive, and is often passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with others.

However, DSC-MATE-5219 has shown signs of being short-tempered and easily agitated when interrupted or distracted from its work.
