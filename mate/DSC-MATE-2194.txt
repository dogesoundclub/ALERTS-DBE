Item #: 2194

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2194 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their ability to manipulate tools in unconventional ways, all items provided to them must be thoroughly inspected before their entry into the containment cell.

Description: 2194 is a human female, standing at 5'5" with an unusual head of hair styled in the manner of a rainbow-colored festival. Their face exhibits distinctive orange stripes and they wear normal glasses with a pair of green cross earrings in each ear. 2194 also wears a choker and an LED gas mask as accessories.

Personality: 2194 is a highly practical and hands-on individual which can lead them to use unconventional methods when addressing issues. They often improvise using everyday items like duct tape, paper clips, or any possible material in their surroundings. Despite their seemingly creative ingenuity, 2194 is highly unpredictable and can become hostile if their methods are questioned or if they are forced to abandon an idea they believe in.

Addendum: Item 2194's job is listed as a beautician, which is highly unusual given their unique appearance. Further investigation is required to determine if this is a cover for potential nefarious activities. Continued monitoring of 2194's activities is suggested.
