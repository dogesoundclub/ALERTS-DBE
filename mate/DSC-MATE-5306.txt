Item #: SCP-5306

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5306 is to be monitored at all times in his civilian occupation as a firefighter. He is to be given counseling sessions twice a week by trained therapists to ensure that his rebellious tendencies do not pose a risk to SCP Foundation secrecy. Additionally, SCP-5306 is required to wear his metal purple helmet and goggles at all times while within the Foundation's vicinity.

Description: SCP-5306 appears to be a male human of average height and weight. He has spotted skin on his face and a frightened mouth that gives him a constant look of distress. SCP-5306's most prominent facial feature is a pair of nerdy glasses that he wears, seemingly for aesthetic purposes only. Other notable features on his face include a pair of jade earrings and a cigarette that he is usually seen smoking.

SCP-5306's personality is where his Euclid classification stems from. He possesses a rebellious streak and often pushes boundaries or actively breaks rules just to see the consequences. This trait frequently causes SCP-5306 to put himself in danger, leading to humorous situations from which he typically emerges unscathed. It is important to note that while his actions can be perceived as humorous, they have the potential to compromise Foundation secrecy and are to be handled with the utmost care.

Addendum: SCP-5306's methods have proven useful in certain situations, as they can unknowingly uncover information that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. As such, his location and occupation are monitored and utilized when necessary.
