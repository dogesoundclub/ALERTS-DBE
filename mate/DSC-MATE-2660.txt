Item #: SCP-2660

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2660 is to be housed in a human-like containment chamber, equipped with standard amenities such as food, water, and appropriate environmental enrichment. Personnel interacting with SCP-2660 must wear gloves to prevent transmission of Zoonotic diseases. Any emotional or physical interactions with SCP-2660 must be supervised and approved by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-2660 is a male Monkey species, standing at 1.2 meters tall with bright and lively appearance. The subject is often seen wearing a red beanie with a two-color band stretched around his forehead. SCP-2660's most defining feature is the jade earring adorned on his left ear lobes, and a gold chain around his neck. SCP-2660 is often seen smoking a cigarette, which he uses as his second accessory.

SCP-2660 is known for their exceptional charisma, enabling the subject to connect instantly with strangers on a deep level, often resulting in humorous situations. SCP-2660 has the ability to make people open up about their life stories effortlessly, and through sharing funny and anecdotal experiences, they lead people to connect deeply with one another. SCP-2660 is highly intelligent and resourceful, and their empathetic personality makes them an excellent team player.

Addendum: SCP-2660 was initially contained after being spotted monkeying around the city centre, drawing attention from the public. SCP Foundation's agents were quick to react, and SCP-2660 was taken to Site-19 for containment. SCP-2660 has since adjusted well to containment and has become one of the most endearing animals in the facility. SCP-2660's charm and social skills have resulted in several requests from personnel to interact with SCP-2660 in off-duty hours, which have been approved. SCP-2660, however, remains under strict supervision at all times.
