Item #: SCP-1470

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1470 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate rabbit-sized furniture and decorations. Exercise and playtime are to be provided daily. SCP-1470 is not to be introduced to any other SCP entities, as his social nature may lead to unwanted attention from other creatures.

Description: SCP-1470 appears as a male anthropomorphic rabbit wearing a purple cap with a headset, red victory band, nerd glasses, and a jade earring. He often wears a red scarf and carries a candy stick, which he frequently nibbles on. SCP-1470 works as a banker in his civilian life, but often spends his free time socializing and telling jokes to anyone who will listen.

SCP-1470's outgoing personality has proven useful in negotiating deals with other SCP entities where language barriers exist. However, his desire for attention and humor can be a distraction in more serious situations. SCP-1470 has shown no aggression towards Foundation personnel and is generally cooperative with testing procedures.

Addendum: SCP-1470 has been known to have exceptional persuasion skills, especially in financial negotiations. Care should be taken when SCP-1470 is involved in transactions with non-Foundation entities, as he may inadvertently reveal information about the Foundation or its operations.
