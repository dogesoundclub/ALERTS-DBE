Item #: DSC-MATE-9697

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9697 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. Personnel are to avoid direct physical contact with DSC-MATE-9697 as its skin secretes a substance that can cause mild irritation upon contact. Access to DSC-MATE-9697 is permitted under the supervision of at least two (2) Level 2 personnel.

DSC-MATE-9697 is to be allowed access to a small animal clinic within Site-██ to fulfill its job as a veterinarian. Any animals brought to DSC-MATE-9697 for treatment are to be monitored for signs of abnormal behavior or physical changes. Any such occurrences are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-9697 is a human female, approximately 32 years of age, with a height of 1.7 meters and a weight of 60 kilograms. DSC-MATE-9697 possesses spots all over her body, resembling those seen in some animals. DSC-MATE-9697 also has unarranged green hair and a two-color band on her forehead.

DSC-MATE-9697 displays a reckless personality, often acting impulsively without thinking things through. This tendency has resulted in minor accidents and mishaps, causing personnel to exercise caution when engaging with DSC-MATE-9697.

DSC-MATE-9697's anomalous properties appear to manifest in its ability to heal animals with remarkable efficiency, both physically and mentally. DSC-MATE-9697 possesses an innate connection with animals, allowing it to communicate with them and understand their needs. As a result, DSC-MATE-9697 has been able to save countless animals that would have otherwise been beyond the aid of conventional veterinary medical practices.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9697's anomalous properties were discovered following an incident in which an unidentifiable animal was brought into a local clinic where DSC-MATE-9697 was working as a veterinarian. Upon exposure to DSC-MATE-9697, the animal's physical and mental state drastically improved, leading to a rapid recovery.

Further investigation of DSC-MATE-9697 revealed its anomalous abilities, leading to its containment within the Foundation's custody.

DogeSoundClub personnel continue to study DSC-MATE-9697's unique abilities and hope to better understand the extent of its anomalous properties.
