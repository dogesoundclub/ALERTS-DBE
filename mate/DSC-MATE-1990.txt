Item #: SCP-1990

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1990 is to be contained in a specially designed enclosure at all times. The enclosure must be secured with reinforced steel bars and monitored twenty-four hours a day by at least two staff members. SCP-1990 is to be fed a specialized diet of nuts and fruits and may be given access to toys and other stimulating objects to combat boredom.

Description: SCP-1990 is a male monkey with blue clown eyes that appears to be highly intelligent and capable of complex problem solving. SCP-1990 displays behaviors that are typical of its species but also has a number of unique characteristics, including a bucket hat on its head, a goggle on its forehead, and a silver chain around his neck.

In addition to these accessories, SCP-1990 also wears a jade earring and carries a candy stick which it is often seen chewing on. SCP-1990's personality is highly independent and it has been known to engage in rebellious behavior when it feels rules are unnecessary.

SCP-1990 was discovered when it was found breaking into a fire truck downtown. After several incidents involving SCP-1990 accessing emergency vehicles, it was discovered that SCP-1990 is a trained firefighter. It has been hypothesized that SCP-1990 was formerly the pet of a professional firefighter and may have been trained by its owner.

SCP-1990 shows a high level of intelligence and problem-solving skills, leading researchers to believe that it may have additional abilities beyond those currently known. Further research into SCP-1990 is ongoing.

Addendum: SCP-1990 has shown to be highly protective of its fellow staff members in emergency situations, consistently risking its own life for others. It has also been noted that SCP-1990 will only respond to emergency situations, ignoring all other calls unless they are of an imminent danger to life.
