Description: DSC-MATE-9215 is a caucasian female approximately 32 years of age, with blue clown eyes and an orange-sided cranium. DSC-MATE-9215 has an accessory resembling goggles that remain affixed to the forehead, despite their lack of function. DSC-MATE-9215's earrings are jade in coloration, and despite appearances, are composed of an unidentified material with anomalous properties. 

DSC-MATE-9215 presents as scatterbrained and often becomes sidetracked or fixated on mundane details. These tangents may lead to humorous situations but pose a risk to containment. DSC-MATE-9215 has been observed forgetting important appointments and becoming lost while navigating unfamiliar locales. It is unclear whether this behavior is a product of DSC-MATE-9215's upbringing or an anomaly caused by exposure to an unidentified DSC. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9215's anomalous properties have yet to be identified. Research must continue to isolate the underlying origin of DSC-MATE-9215's appearance and behavior.
