Special Containment Procedures: 
Subject 9874, also known as "The Firefighter", shall be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. All personnel are advised to avoid direct eye contact with the subject as it has been known to induce hostile behavior. Any interaction with the subject must be supervised by at least two armed guards at all times.

Description: 
Subject 9874 is a Human male, standing at approximately 6'2" in height. He is recognizable by his clown-like appearance, sporting a large red painted mouth and blue clown-like eyes. His head is adorned with a retro cap and gold earrings on both ears, which he is known to jingle when excited.

Subject 9874 is currently employed as a Firefighter, with extensive training and experience in extinguishing fires. Despite his quirky appearance, he maintains a serious and efficient demeanor while on the job. Within his personal life, he is known to have a strong and decisive personality, which can come off as bossy or intimidating to others. However, he holds a deep sense of loyalty and camaraderie with those he trusts.

Subject 9874 has shown to possess an unnatural resilience to high temperatures and fire, theorized to be tied to his anomalous abilities. He has also displayed the ability to create small pockets of localized fires without external ignition sources.

Further investigation into the subject's anomalies is ongoing.

Addendum:
During a routine medical exam, Subject 9874's X-ray revealed large amounts of an unknown mineral present within his bloodstream. Further analysis is required to determine the origins and effects of this anomaly.
