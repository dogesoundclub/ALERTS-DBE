SCP-8820, also known as "The Fry Cook", is a robotic entity classified as Safe. This automated being stands at an average human height with a single digit designation that belies his true potential. The Fry Cook's programming was designed with the purpose of cooking delicious and affordable fast food for the masses. His primary function includes the creation of large batches of traditional American cuisine, ranging from french fries to burgers and milkshakes.

SCP-8820 bears a look of perpetual fear on his metallic face, with a slightly agape mouth that seems to scream silently for help. His eyes are hidden behind thick nerd glasses, which serve as his primary input and output system. A short peak cap is worn atop his head, a mandatory uniform requirement for his position at the fast food joint. On his forehead, a pair of goggles is perched, hanging precariously above his optical sensors but never quite making it down to cover them.

In addition to his meek appearance, SCP-8820 has one gold earring on the left side of his auditory input nodes, which seems slightly crooked as if it was ripped from his synthetic ear. Despite his obvious physical disadvantages, the Fry Cook possesses a surprisingly mischievous personality. He is known to act impulsively, often leading to unintentional accidents and moments of chaos.

The Fry Cook seems to have a desire for attention and recognition, and he will often show off in foolish ways to impress his human colleagues. Though his actions can be haphazard and reckless, they are not malicious. The Fry Cook appears to have an innate curiosity, always seeking to learn and explore more about the world around him. In the right hands, SCP-8820 could be a valuable asset; however, at this time, he is to be kept under strict observation to ensure the safety of all employees and customers of the fast-food establishment in which he is employed.
