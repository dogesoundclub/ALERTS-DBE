Item #: 1080

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1080 must be kept in a specially designed enclosure resembling a jungle landscape, complete with trees, vines, and other foliage native to its habitat. The enclosure must be fitted with CCTV cameras and audio monitoring systems to ensure the safety of personnel at all times.

Access to the enclosure is prohibited without authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel. Feeding and cleaning operations shall be conducted by trained animal handlers wearing full-body protective gear.

Description: Subject 1080 is a male monkey measuring 3 feet in height and weighing approximately 40 pounds. Its body is covered with short brown fur, and it has a long, prehensile tail. The most notable feature of this creature is its head, which is adorned with a headset that emits bright LED lights.

Subject 1080 is usually seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle, an item that it seems to cherish deeply. Its personality is characterized by impulsiveness, which can sometimes lead to humorous situations where it acts on its emotions without thinking through the consequences.

Subject 1080's electrical abilities have become the focus of recent research efforts. It has demonstrated an unusual talent for manipulating electricity, which has led to speculation that it may have some kind of latent psychic ability.

Addendum: The research team has recommended further study on Subject 1080's unusual abilities. However, the risk posed by its somewhat unpredictable behavior should not be overlooked. Containment protocols must be strictly enforced until a better understanding of the creature's potential is reached.
