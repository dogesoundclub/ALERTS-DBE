Item #: 4369

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4369 is to be allowed to maintain their usual activities as a beautician, with occasional monitoring of their interactions with clients to ensure they do not reveal any anomalous abilities. Subject 4369 is not to be allowed access to any dangerous or classified materials. Any attempts to interview or question 4369 regarding their abilities or any anomalous activities must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 4369 appears to be a human male in their mid-thirties, with a normal build and blonde hair. Their most striking feature is a spot on their mouth, which appears to be a darker shade of their natural skin tone. They are often seen wearing a medical mask, which they claim is necessary for hygiene reasons in their line of work, as well as a pair of goggles on their forehead and a green cross earring. It is unknown if these accessories hold any anomalous properties.

Subject 4369's unique ability appears to be the ability to influence perception and memory. They possess a scatterbrained personality, often forgetting important things, getting sidetracked easily, and losing their way in unfamiliar places. However, these quirks are not a natural part of their personality - anyone who spends prolonged periods of time in 4369's vicinity begins to exhibit similar behavior. Memories become hazy, people forget important appointments or where they were going, and overall productivity levels decrease significantly.

Addendum: Despite their seemingly innocuous abilities, it is recommended that personnel exercise caution around Subject 4369. Extended exposure to their anomalous effects may result in significant mental impairment, complicating containment efforts.
