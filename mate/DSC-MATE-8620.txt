Item #: SCP-8620

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8620 is to be monitored and observed at all times when present in the local traffic department. Access to any sensitive information is to be restricted to a need-to-know basis. In the event of a containment breach, SCP Foundation personnel are authorized to use lethal force if necessary.

Description: SCP-8620 is a human female of average height and weight, with distinctive spots on her face and prominent red lips. Their eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, which appear to function as a method of enhancing awareness and perception. SCP-8620 is typically seen wearing a gold chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-8620's unique personality is what sets them apart from standard humans. They are known to be very caring and nurturing, often extending this trait to inanimate objects. SCP-8620 has been observed talking to their car, their plants, and even appliances in their home. It is theorized that SCP-8620 perceives the objects around them as animated and capable of thought and feeling.

SCP-8620 has been employed as a traffic officer, and despite their unusual behavior, have proven themselves to be a competent and reliable employee. They display a strong sense of duty and responsibility, particularly when it comes to upholding public safety and regulations.

Further study is required to determine the full extent of SCP-8620's anomalous properties and the source of their unique personality. However, it is clear that they pose a potential threat to the Foundation's mission of containment and secrecy. As such, SCP-8620 must be monitored and contained at all times.
