Item #: 2760

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are advised to not engage with SCP 2760 unless authorized by high-level personnel. SCP 2760 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber is to be fitted with a low-light environment and decorated with jungle-themed wallpaper. All test subjects should be warned that SCP 2760 is potentially lethal and has a strong sense of duty.

Description: SCP 2760 is a male tiger with horned rim glasses and a blue bandana around its head. SCP 2760 is employed as a fast-food worker at a popular fast-food chain. When observed, he exhibits a sense of responsibility and dutifulness that is unusual for an anomalous entity. Despite his very serious demeanor, SCP 2760 is known to let loose and have fun from time to time, showing off his dance moves and exhibiting silly antics. SCP 2760 is a social butterfly and is often found conversing with other employees and customers alike.

Addendum 2760-1: SCP 2760's species remains unknown as no scientific or zoological classification matches SCP 2760's unique features. Additionally, SCP 2760's eyeglasses have proven resistant to all attempts at physical manipulation.

Addendum 2760-2: SCP 2760 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but they can be a source of humor as well, often defaulting to silly antics that leave those around them entertained. This has, on occasion, led to disturbing reports of SCP 2760 acting out in unpredictable, often aggressive ways, leaving personnel to proceed with caution when around SCP 2760.

Addendum 2760-3: SCP 2760's presence can deceptively appear as a friendly and harmless fast-food worker. This has led to suspicions of potential anomalous influence altering the senses of the public, causing them to overlook the strangeness of SCP 2760's appearance and behavior. Investigations are ongoing.
