Item #: DSC-MATE-2543

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2543 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. Access to DSC-MATE-2543 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or above with clearance granted by at least two Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-2543's daily routine of operating a train is to be monitored remotely to ensure the safety of the public.

Description: DSC-MATE-2543 appears to be a human male of average height, with a distinctive mark on his mouth resembling a spot. DSC-MATE-2543 always wears a blue bandana over his head and a medical mask that covers his mouth, likely for reasons related to the containment of his anomalous traits. DSC-MATE-2543's most notable feature are its red clown eyes, a physical trait seemingly unconnected to DSC-MATE-2543's occupation or any physical ailment.

DSC-MATE-2543 is a train driver by profession, and its personality appears to revolve entirely around its job. DSC-MATE-2543 has been noted to be forgetful and easily distracted, often leading to humorous situations or minor inconveniences. Despite these traits, DSC-MATE-2543's driving remains remarkably safe and efficient, leading researchers to believe that the anomalous nature of DSC-MATE-2543 is only partially related to its employment.

Addendum: Several attempts have been made to remove DSC-MATE-2543's medical mask, but all attempts have resulted in violent outbursts and self-harm attempts. Due to the risks inherent in removing DSC-MATE-2543's means of containment, it is recommended that all interactions with DSC-MATE-2543 be conducted remotely, even during interviews. Further research is necessary to determine the full scope and nature of DSC-MATE-2543's anomalous properties.
