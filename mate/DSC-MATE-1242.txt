Item #: SCP-1242

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: All broadcasts of SCP-1242 must be monitored and reviewed by Foundation personnel to ensure that no anomalous effects are being broadcasted. Any civilians who exhibit abnormal behavior after viewing a broadcast must be immediately apprehended and given amnestics. SCP-1242 is to be informed that she is being monitored for her safety and must not become aware of the true nature of her abilities or her containment.

Description: SCP-1242 is a human female, approximately 35 years of age, and is employed as a news anchor for a local television station. She possesses several anomalous features, including a spotted skin pattern, purple lips, and red clown eyes. Her head appears to be adorned with rainbow festival elements, and she wears a silver chain and a jade earring. Her forehead is marked with a two-color band, and she frequently wears a medical mask.

SCP-1242’s main anomalous effect is her ability to induce playful arguments with those around her. This ability is not always intentional and has been shown to occur even when SCP-1242 is not actively engaging in conversation or debate. These arguments often result in laughter and good-natured teasing, but they have also caused fights and heated disagreements in the past.

SCP-1242 is known for her quick wit and love of debate, and she frequently engages in playful arguments with friends and family. It is currently unknown if SCP-1242 is aware of her anomalous abilities or if she is purposely using them to cause playful arguments. Foundation personnel are tasked with monitoring her behavior and preventing any potential breaches.

Addendum 1242-A: On ██/██/20██, SCP-1242 was involved in a televised debate with a prominent politician. During the debate, SCP-1242’s anomalous effects appeared to intensify, causing the politician to become increasingly agitated and irritable. Following this incident, Foundation personnel were able to secure SCP-1242 and limit her public appearances. Research into the anomalous nature of SCP-1242’s abilities is ongoing.
