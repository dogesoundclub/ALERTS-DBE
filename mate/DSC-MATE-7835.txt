Item #: SCP-7835

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7835 is to be kept in a heavily guarded location within Site-██. No personnel are allowed to make physical contact with SCP-7835, and all communications with it must be carried out via remote means.

Description: SCP-7835 appears to be a humanoid robot consisting of various metallic components. Its head is covered with a red beanie, while its mouth is concealed behind a medical mask. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this SCP is the red scarf it wears around its neck. Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-7835 displays a distinct personality, which has been described as rebellious and boundary-pushing.

SCP-7835 is a self-proclaimed "Mafia Boss", and its behavior appears to reflect this. It has been observed attempting to assert dominance over Foundation personnel, utilizing its robotic strength and unconventional tactics. However, SCP-7835's rebellious tendencies can also lead to humorous situations, such as deliberately breaking rules or finding ways to bend them.

The origins of SCP-7835 are currently unknown, but it is believed that it was created in a clandestine laboratory with unknown intentions. Its anomalous properties allow it to communicate and interact with humans, but also make it a target for potential misuse.

Addendum: All attempts to dismantle SCP-7835 or discover its inner workings have been met with failure. It appears to possess an advanced self-repair mechanism, and any attempt to access its internal components results in immediate shutdown. As such, containment of SCP-7835 remains a top priority.
