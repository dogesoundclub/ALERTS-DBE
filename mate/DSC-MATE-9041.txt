Item #: 9041

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9041 is to be kept in a standard holding cell at Site-██. All visitors to the cell must be accompanied by two armed guards and be approved by at least one Level 4 personnel. Any attempt by subject 9041 to leave the cell is to be met with lethal force.

Description: Subject 9041 appears to be a seemingly harmless human female, approximately 28 years of age. She is a successful fashion designer outside of Foundation knowledge, and uses her career as a means of accessing influential individuals within the fashion industry. Subject 9041 possesses a unique facial structure, characterized by red clown eyes, spotting, and a bold red lip. Additionally, she wears a green cross earring and a choker.

Subject 9041 has a highly analytical and logical personality, and will commonly initiate arguments with others for her own amusement. She will fixate on relatively insignificant topics, sparking volatile debates that can often turn violent. The nature of her personality and appearance suggests that she may have some degree of anomalous ability not yet fully understood by the Foundation. However, any attempts to study or examine such abilities have been met with hostility, and are heavily discouraged.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, Subject 9041 made a daring escape attempt after dislocating both of her wrists in her cell. She was apprehended by security personnel before leaving Site-██, but not before she was able to set fire to several pieces of SCP-███ contained in the area. Any personnel who underestimate the threat level of subject 9041 are to be disciplined, and all further attempts at researching her anomalous qualities are to be suspended indefinitely.
