Item #: 4971

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4971 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All personnel interacting with 4971 must wear appropriate protective gear, including gas masks, to avoid emotional manipulation.

Description: 4971 is a female human identified as a mechanic. She has orange stripes on her face, possibly tattooed, and often wears a smile. Her glasses and gold earring are normal, but she is frequently seen wearing a silver chain and a gas mask.

4971 has displayed a strong sense of empathy and can sense the emotions of others with remarkable accuracy. Her abilities have led to humorous situations, such as diffusing tense moments with humor or helping others see the lighter side of difficult situations.

Despite her apparent good nature, 4971 must be handled with caution. Her emotional abilities can be used to manipulate others for nefarious purposes, and extreme caution must be exercised when interacting with her. It is uncertain if she is aware of her own abilities or if they are unconscious.

Additional Notes: Further research is required to determine the true extent of 4971's emotional manipulative abilities. Personnel who interact with her should remain vigilant and report any unusual emotional responses or reactions.
