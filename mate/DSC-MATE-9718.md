Description: Subject 9718, a human male in his late thirties, stands at a height of 6'1" and weighs 200 lbs. The subject's most striking features include a purple cap with a headset, red clown eyes, and orange stripes, which appear to be painted on their face. Subject 9718 also has a silver chain, green cross earring, and a pair of goggles resting on their forehead.

The subject works as a train driver and has shown proficiency in operating the vehicle, but it is unknown how they acquired the necessary qualifications for the job. Subject 9718 is exceptionally knowledgeable in various obscure topics, and they exhibit an insatiable appetite for learning more. They often spend their free time reading books or watching documentaries, and have even displayed an impressive collection of educational materials.

Subject 9718 is quite passionate about sharing their newfound knowledge with others, often engaging in lengthy conversations about topics they find vital or interesting. However, they have also been observed to become agitated when their knowledge is challenged or dismissed.

Addendum: Foundation operatives were initially alerted to Subject 9718 after their colleagues reported odd behavior and uncharacteristic aggression towards passengers on the train. It is still unclear what may have caused the sudden change in behavior, but it is believed to be tied to a recent acquisition of knowledge. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate measures to prevent any further incidents.
