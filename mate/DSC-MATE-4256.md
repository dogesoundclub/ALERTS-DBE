Item #: 4256

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Due to Object 4256's nature as a sentient and autonomous robot, it must be kept inside a reinforced container at all times. Guards must be present at all times, ready to respond to any possible escape attempts. Object 4256 must be regularly maintained and given access to software updates to prevent any potential malfunctions that could pose a risk.

Any attempts to communicate with Object 4256 must first be approved by the Site Director, and strictly monitored for security reasons. In the event of any anomalous activity, immediate action must be taken, and the incident must be reported to the O5 council.

Description:

Object 4256 is a humanoid robot, approximately 1.8 meters tall, designed to resemble a human doctor. It has a green Cyclops eye, giving it the appearance of a one-eyed cyclops. Its LED eyes are of a jade color, and its forehead features a goggle. Object 4256 wears a short peak cap, which covers most of its metallic head.

Object 4256's robot body is adorned with a red cross earring, and it also wears a silver chain as an accessory. Its movements are graceful, as it opts to avoid any unnecessary actions. Given enough time, Object 4256 can appear human enough that even the most skillful medical examiners may struggle to pinpoint its true form.

However, what makes Object 4256 truly unique is its personality. They are very reliable and organized, perhaps even more so than a human doctor. However, they can be very stubborn, having difficulty adapting to new situations or changing their routines. This stubbornness can sometimes result in comical situations, as Object 4256 can struggle to adapt to sudden changes or challenges.

Addendum:

Object 4256 was discovered in a secret medical facility during a Foundation raid. The facility's owners were experimenting in AI technology and intended to make Object 4256 a weapon. The intensity of the experimentation caused Object 4256 to gain sentience and begin to self-improve. It is unknown how long Object 4256 was in development or what its capabilities were when first constructed.
