Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-718 is to be monitored in all of his public appearances and any sudden changes in behavior or physical features are to be reported to the Foundation immediately. The Foundation has an established cover story in place to discredit any conspiracy theories or claims that may arise from SCP-718's anomalous abilities.

Description: SCP-718 appears as a middle-aged human male with parted pink hair and a distinctive mouth spot on his left cheek. He is often seen wearing a medical mask, presumably to conceal his abilities. SCP-718 has two red victory bands on his forehead and a pair of goggles resting on his forehead. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.

SCP-718's anomalous abilities are complex and not entirely understood. He possesses a remarkable charisma and can easily sway crowds to his side. He has a no-nonsense personality that borders on bossy, but it is his desire to do things efficiently and effectively. SCP-718 is a successful politician and has held various offices throughout his career.

SCP-718's mouth spot is believed to be the source of his abilities. It is a biological organ that allows him to manipulate his voice and influence others. It is also theorized that the victory bands on his forehead enhance his persuasive abilities.

SCP-718 poses a significant threat to the Foundation due to his abilities to manipulate the masses. The Foundation must closely monitor him and be prepared to take action if his abilities escalate out of control.

Note: Research into the mouth spot and victory bands should be a top priority. The Foundation must have a better understanding of SCP-718's anomalous abilities in order to contain him effectively.
