SCP-5172, also known as "The Rebel," is a male tiger of unknown origin and a former security guard in the Foundation's urban fantasy division. SCP-5172 possesses a frightened mouth, paired with eyes resembling ski goggles, and frequently wears a Doge hat and a jade earring in his left ear.

Although SCP-5172 was initially brought into the Foundation as a rule-abiding individual, over time, his rebellious nature began to surface. The security guard enjoys testing boundaries and defying authority, leading to numerous humorous (but potentially dangerous) situations. SCP-5172 has been known to purposely break rules or bend them to see what happens, much to the chagrin of his superiors.

Notable incidents involving SCP-5172 include his successful attempts to sneak unauthorized personnel into restricted areas, his creation of homemade weapons from Foundation equipment, and his habit of using his whistle as an impromptu musical instrument during routine patrols.

Despite his tendency towards insubordination, SCP-5172 is well-regarded among his colleagues for his bravery and willingness to put himself in harm's way to protect others. However, it is recommended that caution be taken when interacting with SCP-5172 to avoid potential breaches caused by his disregard for protocols.
