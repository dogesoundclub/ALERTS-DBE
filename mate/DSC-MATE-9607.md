Description: 

9607 was a human female with striking orange stripes adorning her face.  Her bright red clown eyes often caught the attention of those around her. Her blonde hair had an imposing wing protruding from the left side of her face, giving her a demonic presence. She often wore a medical mask on her mouth and goggles on her forehead, suggesting a fear of contamination. Jade earrings and a gold chain were seen as frequent accessories.

Personality:

9607 exhibited a rigid, controlled, and efficient personality. She was well-organized and precise, creating humorous situations as she took control over group projects and delegating tasks in a matter-of-fact way. 9607â€™s efficient demeanor allowed her to work as a successful programmer, but also created a tendency to be controlling, leading to social difficulties. It is believed that this characteristic arose from an incident in her childhood where she witnessed the effects of disorganization and incompetency.

Addendum: 
Upon further investigation, it was discovered that 9607 lacked any anomalous abilities. Her heightened sense of organization and efficiency was merely a personality trait. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain records of previously thought anomalous individuals, in case any new information comes to light.
