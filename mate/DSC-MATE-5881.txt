Item #: 5881

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is permitted to live among the general population provided that she reports any abnormal activities related to her occupation as a Real Estate Agent. She is under surveillance at all times by embedded Foundation agents, and is to be taken in for questioning if any suspicious activity is detected.

Description: SCP-5881 is a female human of average height and weight, with spots on her face and purple lips. She often wears a bucket hat on her head and normal glasses on her eyes. SCP-5881 also wears a medical mask over her mouth for health purposes.

SCP-5881's forehead features a two-color band and a choker accessory. Personality-wise, SCP-5881 has a love for adventure and often takes risks or tries new things. This tendency has resulted in some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

SCP-5881's proficiency in the real estate industry has drawing interest from GoI-003 "The Realest Realty", but negotiations for an alliance with the Foundation failed due to its connections with GoI-003.

Despite her seemingly harmless nature, the Foundation has determined SCP-5881 to be a potential asset for clandestine operations, and as such, she is being evaluated for recruitment into the Foundation's task force units. 

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-5881 was successful in negotiating the sale of a disused Foundation site to GoI-003 for a price of $200,000 US dollars. SCP-5881's familiarity with Foundation assets is under investigation. Further action is pending.
