Item #: DSC-MATE-1837

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1837 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Its bucket hat and goggles are to be removed upon entry, and its normal gas mask is to be replaced with a non-functional replica. DSC-MATE-1837 is to have access to basic tool sets and repair materials for its mechanic work. Any requests for gifts are to be reviewed by a Level 3 researcher before approval.

Description: DSC-MATE-1837 is a male rabbit species standing at 1.2 meters in height. Its eyes are covered by normal glasses and wears a green bucket hat with a goggle on its forehead. It also wears a jade earring on its right ear and a silver chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-1837 exhibits moderate dexterity and knowledge with mechanical materials, indicating it was previously employed as a mechanic. 

DSC-MATE-1837 displays high levels of observance and attention to detail, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, its desire to give the "perfect" gift can lead to prolonged periods of indecisiveness and consequential frustration. Its normal gas mask is a self-imposed accessory to deal with possible allergic reactions to the environment.

DSC-MATE-1837 has no anomalous abilities or properties known to Foundation researchers at this time. 

Addendum: Request to classify DSC-MATE-1837 as Euclid is under review following an incident where DSC-MATE-1837 bypassed security clearance to give a gift to a Level 2 personnel. DSC-MATE-1837 received disciplinary actions for violating Foundation policies.
