Item #: 5016

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5016 is to be contained in Site-██'s Media Center, where it is to be provided with basic amenities including a computer, a desk, and a chair. Standard security measures are to be in place. SCP-5016 is allowed to leave Site-██'s grounds for normal work-related activities. However, it must submit daily reports to Agent ██████ detailing its interactions and any anomalous activity.

Description: SCP-5016 is a female human of average height and build. Its most striking feature is its VR Rainbow LED eyes, which are visible at all times. SCP-5016 typically wears a Not Arranged Green headband with a Jade Earring, Medical Mask, and a Silver Chain.

SCP-5016 is a reporter by profession, and its work often involves investigating and reporting on paranormal and unexplained phenomena. Its laid-back and easy-going demeanor make it an excellent candidate for such work, as it can approach potentially dangerous situations with a calm and professional attitude.

Despite this, SCP-5016 is fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. This can manifest in humorous situations, such as getting into heated arguments with individuals who insult its friends or family members. SCP-5016 has been known to use its investigative skills to help protect its loved ones from harm.

SCP-5016's anomalous properties are limited to its LED eyes, which have no apparent medical explanation. Researchers have attempted to replicate the effect with no success. SCP-5016 claims that it received the modification as part of an experimental cybernetic surgery, though this has not been verified.

Addendum: During routine testing, SCP-5016 revealed it had been researching and actively seeking anomalous objects, claiming they could solve many of the world's problems. Agent ██████ has been tasked with monitoring SCP-5016's activities more closely.
