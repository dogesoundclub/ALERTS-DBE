Item #: SCP-5912

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5912 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. She is allowed access to any non-anomalous tool or object she may require for her assigned work as a mechanic, but all SCP-5912 property requests must be reviewed by at least two Level 2 personnel before approval. Any anomalous materials or objects must be reported to Site Security immediately.

Description: SCP-5912 is a female human of average height and build, with spots on her face and a friendly smile. Her hair is dyed a metallic blue color, which extends to cover her entire head. She wears a gold chain around her neck and sports a pair of jade earrings. SCP-5912's glasses appear to be of normal design, and her medical mask covers her mouth at all times.

SCP-5912 has displayed a peculiar trait of being excessively detail-oriented, paying careful attention to every little detail even in otherwise mundane tasks. She shows a strong preference for organizing things, often alphabetizing or color-coding her personal belongings. SCP-5912 views this trait as a strength and takes pride in it, often bragging about her attention to detail to anyone who will listen.

One unusual feature of SCP-5912 is the goggle she keeps on her forehead at all times. Although it appears to be a simple pair of protective eyewear, SCP-5912 has stated that it is essential to her work as a mechanic, though she has not given any further explanation.

Addendum: SCP-5912 was discovered in a small auto repair shop in [REDACTED]. Foundation agents were alerted to her anomalous behavior by a customer who reported seeing her organize the entire contents of a toolbox by size and type of tool. SCP-5912 willingly came with agents when approached and has been cooperative during all testing and containment.
