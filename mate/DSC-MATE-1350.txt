Item #: 1350

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1350 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The room must be equipped with audio and visual recording devices as well as sensors to detect any anomalies. The subject is permitted to hold employment as a theater manager but must not leave the designated area without supervision. Any gifts given by the subject must be thoroughly inspected and approved by at least one staff member before being allowed to leave the containment area.

Description: Subject 1350 appears to be a human female with distinctive orange stripes on one side of her head. She possesses a bright, infectious smile and eyes that are permanently altered to resemble those of a clown with a red hue. Subject 1350's most prominent feature is a pair of jade earrings that hang from elongated ears. She is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck.

Subject 1350's personality is marked by a deep sense of observation and attention to detail. These traits make her exceptionally talented at gift-giving, as she is capable of noticing even the slightest preferences of the recipient. However, this ability can also lead her to overanalyze and become emotionally invested in the art of gift-giving to the point of obsession.

Addendum: Following an incident in which subject 1350's gift-giving obsession manifested in erratic behavior, all gifts must now be pre-approved by staff to avoid any potential danger to the subject or others.
