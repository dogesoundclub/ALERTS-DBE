Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2003 is to be contained in a secure underground vault at Site-██. The chamber must be comprised of steel-reinforced concrete and lined with ferromagnetic materials to prevent interference with electronic equipment. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear non-magnetic attire to avoid any potential magnetic disturbances. In addition, the use of any electronic device within a 10-meter proximity of DSC-MATE-2003 is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to forcibly open DSC-MATE-2003 will result in termination with deadly force.
