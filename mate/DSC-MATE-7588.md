DSC-MATE-7588's electrician skills are excellent, but they seem to have secondary abilities as they can predict events before they happen or sense emotions in other creatures.

DSC-MATE-7588's personality may make it difficult to communicate, and the eerie feeling they give off makes human interaction difficult. DSC-MATE-7588's intuition makes them an excellent candidate for predicting potential threats and events before they occur.
