Item #: SCP-2745

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2745 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with no access to any objects containing sugar or corn syrup. The chamber must be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-2745 is a male Human of unknown age, with distinctive orange stripes on his face. He sports green hair and a purple cap, with a green cross earring on his left ear. SCP-2745 is always seen carrying a candy stick, which it claims is a key component to sustaining its anomalous abilities.

SCP-2745's abilities manifest through his great sense of humor, often using humor to distract and disorient its opponents. SCP-2745's humor may take the form of jokes, silly impersonations, or amusing anecdotes. When SCP-2745's humor affects a target, it can cause them to feel apathetic, lethargic or even to fall into a trance-like state. SCP-2745 can also use its abilities to control its surroundings, creating illusions or changing the perception of those around it.

SCP-2745 has been observed to enjoy causing chaos and disruption, leading to it being categorized as a villain. It seems to take pleasure in making others laugh, particularly when it can cause further confusion and disorder.

Addendum: SCP-2745's origins are unknown, and it's still unclear how it gained its anomalous abilities. More research is needed to determine the extent of its abilities and any potential weaknesses. For now, it must be considered a potential threat to the safety of the Foundation and the general public.
