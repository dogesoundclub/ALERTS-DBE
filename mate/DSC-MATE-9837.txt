Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9837 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished with materials appropriate for a simian subject. The subject should be monitored on a regular basis, and monitored for any unusual or abnormal behavior. Any changes in behavior should be reported to Site-19 immediately.

Description: SCP-9837 is a male monkey of an unknown species, standing at approximately 1 meter in height. The subject wears a bucket hat on his head, with a two-color band on his forehead. SCP-9837 also wears nerd glasses and a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-9837 identifies as a delivery driver, and has displayed a penchant for organization and planning. Despite this, the subject also exhibits a spontaneous side, which has led to various unplanned adventures and party-planning that has been well-received by his peers.

SCP-9837 displays no anomalous properties or abilities, and appears to be a standard simian creature. However, it is noted that his personality and behaviors may have been influenced by his prolonged exposure to human society and culture.
