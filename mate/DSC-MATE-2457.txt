Item #: 2457

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not assigned to active duty. Personnel are advised to approach the subject with caution as they may exhibit signs of stubbornness and a strong sense of independence.

Description: Subject #2457 appears to be a male of average height and build. Their head is covered in a metallic purple material that appears to be a type of armor. They wear normal glasses over their eyes and a single gold earring in their left ear.

Personality: Subject #2457 exhibits a strong sense of independence and personal strength. They may be reluctant to ask for help, even in situations where it would be in their best interest. This trait can lead to humorous situations such as trying to move heavy objects by themselves or refusing to use a map when lost.

Addendum: The subject is currently employed as a Traffic Officer within central city areas, showing a strange affinity for directing the flow of vehicles with an almost compulsive edge. It has been noted that few occasions with civilian vehicle drivers are needed to redirect, and subject #2457 has taken pride in the enforcement of street codes - mostly with an iron will but with compassion shown at times where appropriate. The subject has proven cooperative in all assignments, with a high chance of passing psychological and physical clearance for basic duties as per the Central City Protection Agency.

All interactions with the subject must be approached with caution and respect to their sense of independence. Any instances of disrespect or abuse of authority will be met with disciplinary action or termination of duty.
