Item #: 5851

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As a public figure, 5851 cannot be contained physically. Instead, Foundation agents are to monitor his public appearances and speeches, ensuring that they align with the interests of the Foundation. Any deviation is to be noted and addressed with appropriate measures.

Description: 5851 appears to be a male tiger, possessing physical features consistent with the species. Notably, he wears a red beanie on his head and a gold earring on his left earlobe. His eyes are obscured by nerd glasses, and his mouth appears to be frozen in a frightened expression.

Note that the above details are subject to change given 5851's current occupation as a politician. He is known to wear a red scarf and smoke cigarettes in public.

Personality: Despite his intimidating appearance, 5851 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, both to his constituents and to the Foundation. However, he also knows how to let loose, often surprising others with his dance moves and silly antics at social events when he thinks no one is watching. 

It is unclear whether these behaviors are a result of his tiger instincts or a conscious decision to alleviate the stress of his job. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of 5851's capabilities and the possible implications of his unique personality.
