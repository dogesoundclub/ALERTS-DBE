SCP Foundation Description:
SCP-3518 is a humanoid rabbit species that goes by the name of "Doctor." The subject usually wears a police cap that seems to have a significant importance to their culture.

The rabbit usually dons a silver chain around its neck and displays strong traditional values, which is evident in its no-nonsense attitude towards certain matters. SCP-3518 may come off as aloof initially, but they also have a playful side, which is expressed through their storytelling and humor. While SCP-3518 can be serious about their job, their endearing personality makes them a valuable asset to the Foundation. As an intelligent creature, SCP-3518 adapts quickly to given situations, making them an efficient and capable doctor.
