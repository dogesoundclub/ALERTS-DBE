Item #: SCP-6067

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6067 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Instances of SCP-6067-1 are to be confiscated and disposed of properly. SCP-6067 is allowed to interact with personnel for testing purposes, but must be under constant surveillance.

Description: SCP-6067 is a human female, approximately 29 years of age, with spots on her face and red lips. They have orange eyebrows and wear their hair in pig tails. SCP-6067 also wears a red cross earring and a choker as accessories, and is often found with a cigarette. Their occupation outside of containment is a car salesman.

SCP-6067 exhibits a love for adventure and taking risks, making them suitable for testing involving SCP exploration. However, this has also led to situations that require intervention from Foundation personnel. SCP-6067 has shown no indication of using any anomalous abilities, but due to their unpredictable behavior, constant monitoring is necessary.

SCP-6067-1 refers to incidents that arise as a result of SCP-6067's adventurous nature, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. These incidents must be contained and any witnesses are to be administered amnestics. SCP-6067 has been cooperative with containment procedures but has expressed a desire to continue exploring and taking risks.

Addendum: SCP-6067 has expressed interest in joining Mobile Task Force Omega-11 ("Savage Sons") due to their love for adventure and risk-taking personality. Request is currently under review by Site Director.
