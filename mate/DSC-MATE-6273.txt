Item #: 6273

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6273 is to be kept under constant surveillance by no less than two security personnel at all times. Any interaction with 6273 is to be recorded, and no communication is allowed without explicit permission from the Site Director.

Description: Item 6273 appears to be a human male in his mid-thirties, measuring approximately 1.83 meters in height and weighing approximately 88.5 kilograms. His most distinctive features are the orange stripes on his skin and the red clown eyes. The subject typically wears a retro cap with goggles on the forehead, which he claims to be for "style." The subject also sports a gold earring, a gold chain, and a normal gas mask, which he claims to be for self-defense. 

Personality: 6273 is a highly observant and attentive individual, which apparently makes him an excellent gift-giver. However, this trait can also lead to an obsession with giving the "perfect" gift. As a result, he may spend an extensive amount of time thinking about what to get someone and even putting aside his work. Although he is well aware of the situation he is in, he still remains cooperative and friendly with staff, giving no indication of any ill will or ulterior motives. 

Addendum: During the most recent bi-annual psychological examination, 6273 has shown to have an unusual affinity for recognizing and responding to anomalies, often being the first line of detection. While his behavior is certainly helpful for the Foundation's interest, it should be noted that taking advantage of his curiosity should be avoided, and should only be monitored.
