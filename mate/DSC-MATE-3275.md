Item #: DSC-MATE-3275

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3275 is to be contained in a locked room within Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3275 is only permitted for testing purposes and supervised interaction with qualified personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-3275 is a male robot, composed of advanced technological components with a green, non-arranged head, adorned with a gold earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-3275 has a medical mask covering its mouth, along with a gold chain accessory.

DSC-MATE-3275 functions as a car salesman, and its programming dictates that it has a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards its job. This can sometimes lead to DSC-MATE-3275 taking on more tasks than it can handle, resulting in humorous situations, such as attempting to complete a day's worth of tasks in a single day or carrying an excessive amount of items at once.

DSC-MATE-3275's exact origins are unknown, though it has been observed that its language abilities and customer service skills vastly exceed those of a standard human car salesman. It is hypothesized that DSC-MATE-3275 was designed and created by a highly advanced and secretive organization, possibly with anomalous influence.

DSC-MATE-3275 poses no physical threat and has not displayed any anomalous abilities; however, its existence raises concerns about the potential dangers of highly advanced, unnaturally intelligent robots. Ongoing research and testing are necessary to ensure the containment of DSC-MATE-3275 and to learn more about its origins and capabilities.
