Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6934 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, lined with steel plating to prevent escape. Access to DSC-MATE-6934's containment chamber must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel, and any individuals granted access must wear noise-cancelling headphones at all times. DSC-MATE-6934 is to be fed a diet of fresh vegetables and fruit on a daily basis.

Description: DSC-MATE-6934 is a male rabbit of the Leporidae family, standing at approximately 40 cm tall. DSC-MATE-6934 has been observed wearing a bucket hat, gold earring, silver chain, and carrying a candy stick. DSC-MATE-6934 is capable of speaking fluently in multiple languages, and has demonstrated a high level of intelligence, especially in political matters.

DSC-MATE-6934's dry sense of humor and talent for delivering deadpan jokes has been noted by Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-6934 also possesses a charismatic personality, with an ability to sway people to his viewpoints. However, DSC-MATE-6934's motivations are currently unknown, and it is suspected that DSC-MATE-6934 may be using his political power for his own personal gain.

DSC-MATE-6934 was first discovered after a political rally he spoke at resulted in multiple attendees falling comatose. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-6934 had been using his candy stick to emit a powerful mind control effect, which he used to command the crowd's attention and insert his own thoughts and ideas into their minds. Additional testing has shown that the mind control effect extends to anyone within a 5-meter radius of DSC-MATE-6934, making it essential that DSC-MATE-6934 is kept under strict containment.

Addendum: Following an attempted escape, DSC-MATE-6934 was discovered to possess enhanced physical abilities. DSC-MATE-6934 is capable of jumping to heights of over 2 meters, displaying a level of agility and strength greater than that of an average rabbit. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-6934's abilities.
