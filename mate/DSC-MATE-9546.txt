Description: SCP-9546 is a veterinarian robot with a single green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth on its face. SCP-9546 has a pair of horned rim glasses as its eyes, a retro cap on its head, and a goggle on its forehead. It has a silver chain and a whistle as its accessories. SCP-9546 is capable of moving and conversing like a human, though its voice has a mild robotic inflection.

SCP-9546's programming dictates that it behaves like a reliable and organized medical professional, but its stubbornness can lead to some unpredictable situations. The robot has a hard time adapting to changes in its routine or accepting new ideas. Several humorous incidents have occurred when SCP-9546 encountered unexpected challenges, but it has always found a way to overcome them.

SCP-9546 is immune to biological and chemical agents, making it an ideal medical professional for containment facilities. Its routine inspections and repairs ensure that it remains a reliable asset for the Foundation. Despite SCP-9546's idiosyncrasies, it has proven to be a valued member of the Foundation's medical staff.
