Description: DSC-MATE-1436 is a female human politician who exhibits caring and nurturing behavior towards those around her. Her facial features include bright red lips, and she often wears normal glasses. Her hairstyle is reminiscent of a 00s schoolgirl, and she sports a red cross earring. She is typically seen wearing a gold chain and an LED gas mask.

DSC-MATE-1436 has the ability to nurture individuals to the extent of treating them as her own children. This often leads to humorous and awkward encounters where DSC-MATE-1436 takes on the role of a parental figure with colleagues, family, and friends. She is not observed to exhibit any anomalous behavior besides the aforementioned tendency towards nurturing, although her daily activities and motivations remain a subject of interest and investigation.

DSC-MATE-1436's rise to political power is currently under investigation by agents, as her desire for nurturing and caring for people seems to clash with the typical nature of a politician.
