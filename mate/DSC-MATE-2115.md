Item #: 2115

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2115 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with access to theatrical reading materials and scripts. Access to performances and theatrical productions is allowed with prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. Subject 2115 is to wear the provided gas mask at all times outside of their cell to prevent any potential influence on those nearby.

Description: Subject 2115 is a male human, approximately 67 years of age, standing at 6 feet tall. Their head is shaven and resembles that of a monk or priest. Facial features include distinctive, randomly placed spots and a permanent, toothy smile. They are commonly seen with a gold earring in their left ear and a silver chain around their neck.

Personality-wise, Subject 2115 is highly analytical and logical, often engaging in witty observations or teasing others deadpan. Their humor, though quirky, is well-developed, and they enjoy reading and participating in theater productions, thus leading to their current job as a Theater Manager. While they may appear aloof and detached, Subject 2115 is highly perceptive of their surroundings, making their quips and jabs all the more impressive.

Addendum: Despite a lockdown being in place, Subject 2115 managed to sneak out of their cell and form a play within the containment facility. Personnel who viewed the production underwent minor personality shifts and were observed to have a heightened appreciation for the finer arts. A full investigation into this incident is ongoing, and Subject 2115's containment measures have been modified accordingly.
