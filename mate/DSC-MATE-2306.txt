Item #: 2306

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-2306 is to be monitored at all times for any sudden changes in behavior. SCP-2306 is to be provided with the design materials and equipment necessary for their work as a fashion designer. Careful consideration should be taken when providing SCP-2306 with inanimate objects, as they have a tendency to anthropomorphize them.

Any attempts by SCP-2306 to harm themselves or others should be immediately reported and handled by on-site security personnel. SCP-2306's access to the rest of the facility is restricted to a designated work area.

Description:

SCP-2306 is a human female with striking orange stripes on her face, which complement her bright red lipstick. Her eyes are modified with VR Rainbow LED technology, making them appear holographic. Her head has not been arranged in the typical fashion, and is instead a vibrant green. SCP-2306 is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-2306's personality can be described as caring and nurturing, often extending past human interaction and onto inanimate objects. SCP-2306 has been known to name their car, talk to their plants, and even anthropomorphize their household appliances.

SCP-2306's work as a fashion designer has received critical acclaim, with their unique designs and attention to detail earning them a loyal following. Despite their success, SCP-2306 exhibits signs of severe anxiety and has been known to harm themselves when under extreme stress.

Overall, SCP-2306 is a unique and valuable asset to the Foundation, but careful monitoring and restriction of access to potentially harmful objects is necessary for their safety and the safety of others.
