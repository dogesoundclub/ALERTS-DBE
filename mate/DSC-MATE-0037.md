Item #: 37

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: During live broadcasts, Agent 37 must be monitored at all times. Any abnormal behavior or use of anomalous abilities must be reported immediately to the Site Director. It is imperative that Agent 37 remains undetected by non-foundation personnel.

Description: Agent 37 appears to be a male rabbit of average height and weight. His eyes resemble ski goggles and he is often seen wearing a bucket hat, red scarf, and carrying a whistle. Despite his innocuous appearance, his deadpan sense of humor often catches people off guard and has been known to elicit unexpected reactions.

While on live broadcasts, Agent 37 displays the ability to manipulate reality through the use of anomalous broadcasting techniques. The full extent of his abilities is currently unknown, and further research is required.

Personality: Agent 37 is highly analytic and often approaches problems with a dry sense of humor. He is a master of deadpan delivery and can surprise others with his wit and sarcasm. Despite his ability to bring joy and laughter to those around him, he is also highly guarded and will not reveal his true emotions easily.

Addendum: During a routine broadcast, Agent 37's true nature was almost exposed to the public. He was able to use his anomalous abilities to manipulate the situation and erase any record of the event. It is imperative that we monitor Agent 37 closely to prevent any additional incidents.
