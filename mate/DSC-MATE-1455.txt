SCP-1455, also known as "The Farmer," is a female human of unknown age. SCP-1455 is notable for having bright orange stripes across their face, along with blue clown eyes that seem to be in a constant state of amusement. Their head is adorned with pig tails, while a pair of goggles remain affixed to their forehead at all times. SCP-1455's ears are pierced and adorned with a single jade earring, while a medical mask covers their mouth, obscuring the lower half of their face.

SCP-1455 tends to present as a very caring individual, displaying a deep compassion for all living beings, as well as certain inanimate objects. They have been observed naming their car, talking to their plants, and even anthropomorphizing common household appliances. The individual's nurturing tendencies have been known to extend to colleagues and subjects alike, often going out of their way to provide comfort and support.

Despite SCP-1455's seemingly benevolent disposition, caution is advised when interacting with the individual. It is possible that their nurturing tendencies may mask hidden intentions, and their unusual appearance may indicate the presence of anomalous abilities or traits. As always, careful observation and documentation of SCP-1455's behavior and actions are required to ensure the continued safety and security of Foundation personnel.
