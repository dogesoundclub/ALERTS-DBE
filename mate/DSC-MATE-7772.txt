Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7772 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Due to its docile nature, no further containment measures are necessary. However, SCP-7772 is to be monitored at all times to ensure its well-being.

Description:

SCP-7772 is a male rabbit of normal size and weight. It has been observed to wear a retro cap and glasses as well as sport a gold earring and chain. SCP-7772 is also known to keep a whistle on its person at all times.

Despite its non-anomalous appearance, SCP-7772 possesses a unique ability to connect with individuals on a deep and personal level. This talent has resulted in SCP-7772's reputation for possessing remarkable charisma, often disarming interviewers with its humor and easy demeanor.

SCP-7772's personality has also been known to inspire trust and encourages strangers to divulge personal anecdotes with great ease. These abilities have rendered SCP-7772 an asset to the Foundation in gathering information from the public when necessary.

Addendum:

SCP-7772 was contained after being discovered in a local park in [REDACTED] after several reports of citizens conversing and laughing with a rabbit emerged. The Foundation managed to intercept SCP-7772 before these interactions drew unwanted attention. SCP-7772's handler reports that it is incredibly docile and displays none of the aggression typically exhibited by rabbits in captivity.
