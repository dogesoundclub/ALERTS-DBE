SCP-7091 is not to be trifled with, as her impulsive behavior can lead to dangerous situations for all those around her. Her tendency to act on her emotions makes her unpredictable and volatile, and caution must be exercised when in her presence.

Despite her villainous tendencies, there is a sense of lightheartedness to her personality.

However, this should not be taken lightly, as her impulsive behavior can quickly turn deadly.

The origins of SCP-7091 and her motivations for her villainous activities are currently unknown. Further investigation and research is required to determine the full extent of her capabilities and potential dangers she poses to society.
