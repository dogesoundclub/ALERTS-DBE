Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4251 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with basic amenities. Her headset and other personal belongings are to be permitted but monitored for any anomalous activity. All communication with DSC-MATE-4251 is to be supervised and recorded for research purposes. Any attempt by DSC-MATE-4251 to conduct protests or acts of social justice must be reported and controlled by Foundation staff.

DSC-MATE-4251 must undergo regular psychological assessments to monitor her idealistic and borderline radical tendencies. Any indication of a change in behavior must be reported immediately to prevent potential threat to Foundation security.

Description: DSC-MATE-4251 is a human female in her mid-thirties with blue clown eyes, and wears a purple cap with a headset. Her forehead features a two-color band, and she wears a gold earring and a silver chain as accessories. The subject works as a fashion designer, but reportedly has a strong desire to make the world a better place through activism and social justice movements.

During initial containment, DSC-MATE-4251 displayed a strong attachment to her ideals and positions on various socio-political issues. Instances of her protesting and boycotting organizations and causes she perceives as going against her values were observed.

DSC-MATE-4251's idealistic personality has led her to conduct unauthorized protests and acts of social justice within Foundation facilities, disrupting standard operations and compromising security protocols. Despite this, the subject has not shown any intentional harm to staff or Foundation assets.

It is currently unknown if DSC-MATE-4251's anomalous effects manifest through her activism, fashion design, or other means. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of her potential anomalous abilities and any necessary containment measures.
