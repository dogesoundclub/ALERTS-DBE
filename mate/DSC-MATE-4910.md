Item #: DSC-MATE-4910

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4910 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit with an electronic device for his job as an electrician. He is to be allowed to keep his glasses, bandana, and earring on his person. His gold chain is to be removed and stored in a secure locker. Any interactions with DSC-MATE-4910 are to be recorded, monitored, and reviewed by Level-3 personnel. Access to DSC-MATE-4910 is restricted to approved research staff only.

Description: DSC-MATE-4910 is a male tiger of indeterminate age and origin. They wear a blue bandana on their head and nerd glasses over their eyes. DSC-MATE-4910 also wears a jade earring in its left ear and a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-4910 has a strong and decisive personality, which can be intimidating to those around him. However, this behavior only manifests when they are trying to ensure that things are done efficiently and effectively.

DSC-MATE-4910 is capable of using electrical tools and devices with impressive skill and precision, leading Foundation personnel to classify him as an electrician. Despite having no formal education or training, DSC-MATE-4910 seems to possess an inherent understanding of electrical systems and devices. All attempts to gather information on DSC-MATE-4910's past have proven unsuccessful.

DSC-MATE-4910's behavior and abilities have led to concerns about its full potential anomalous properties, which have yet to be fully explored. It is believed that prolonged exposure to DSC-MATE-4910 could lead to the development of anomalous electrical phenomena, and as such, it requires careful observation and monitoring. 

Addendum: Following a successful electrical repair operation within Site-19, DSC-MATE-4910 has been commended on its efficiency and has been granted limited clearance for specific electrical repairs at the site with supervising personnel. All future interactions concerning its primary DSC nature must still be supervised and recorded.
