Item #: 5468

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5468 is to be kept under observation at all times. He is to be allowed regular employment as a lawyer, but all documentation related to his employment and personal life is to be monitored and reviewed by Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 5468 is a male human of average height and build. He is notable for his orange-striped face, red clown eyes, and a broad, infectious grin that he flashes frequently. A green cross earring hangs from his left ear, and he wears a retro cap on his head. His mouth is usually covered by a medical mask, and he is regularly seen wearing a red scarf to complete his unusual ensemble.

Subject 5468 has a reputation as someone with a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard. He frequently delivers jokes in a deadpan style, often surprising people with his wit. Despite this talent, he prefers a quieter, more introspective existence and does not consider himself to be the life of the party.

However, his unique appearance and charming personality have made him a popular figure in his community. He is regularly sought out for legal advice and representation, and has proven to be an effective and dedicated lawyer. 

Addendum: A recent investigation has revealed that Subject 5468 possesses anomalous abilities. While the source and extent of these abilities have not been fully determined, it is believed that he may have access to Reality Bending effects. Further research and experimentation are needed to fully understand his capabilities and to determine whether he poses a risk to the Foundation's mission.
