Item #: SCP-6869

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6869 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Any attempts at escaping custody are to be met with immediate disciplinary action. SCP-6869 is permitted scheduled recreational time, provided that it is supervised at all times.

Description: SCP-6869 appears to be a male human in his mid-30s, of average height and build. SCP-6869's most distinctive feature is a large, circular spot located near the corner of his mouth. This is commonly referred to as a "mouth spot." Additionally, SCP-6869 is frequently seen wearing a red beanie on his head, as well as a jade earring in his left ear. Other notable accessories worn by SCP-6869 include a silver chain and a candy stick.

SCP-6869's most unusual feature are its blue clown eyes, which are unnaturally bright and appear to be animated at times. SCP-6869's smile is also a unique feature, as it is extremely wide and can reach nearly ear to ear. SCP-6869's personality is best described as impulsive and emotionally-driven. SCP-6869 has a tendency to act on their emotions without fully considering the potential consequences, which can result in both amusing and dangerous situations.

SCP-6869 is employed as a delivery driver for a local courier service. While SCP-6869's employment is not believed to be anomalous in nature, extra scrutiny is required to ensure that SCP-6869 does not use their position to access sensitive information or materials.

Addendum: SCP-6869 has been observed to exhibit abnormal behavior during times of high emotional stress. During a containment breach at Site-19, SCP-6869 displayed heightened aggression and was observed to emit an unidentified gas from its mouth spot. The gas caused personnel in the immediate area to experience nausea and disorientation, and resulted in a containment breach for several SCP objects. No permanent damage was sustained, but SCP-6869 has subsequently been classified as Euclid. Containment procedures have been revised accordingly.
