Item #: DSC-MATE-8058

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8058 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to their lack of anomalous properties, no additional containment measures are necessary.

Description: DSC-MATE-8058 is a female human approximately 27 years of age. They work as a delivery driver for a local courier service. DSC-MATE-8058 possesses distinctive orange stripes on their face and a permanent, cheerful smile. Their eyes are an unusual orange color, and their head is slightly elongated on one side, which does not appear to affect their health or cognitive abilities.

DSC-MATE-8058 wears a choker around their neck at all times and a standard gas mask when making deliveries, a habit that they have refused to explain but is not considered abnormal in any way.

DSC-MATE-8058 is known to display impulsive behavior, often acting on their emotions without considering the consequences. This can lead to humorous situations, such as when they spontaneously make decisions that catch others off guard.

It is unknown if DSC-MATE-8058's appearance is related to their anomalous behavior or if it is merely a coincidental genetic anomaly. Further study and observation are required to determine the nature of this anomaly.

Addendum 8058-1: On ██/██/2021, DSC-MATE-8058 was involved in a minor car accident while making a delivery. It was discovered during the subsequent medical examinations that DSC-MATE-8058 is immune to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning, a unique adaptation that has not been observed in any other human before. Further testing is being conducted to determine the extent of this immunity and if it has any other anomalous properties.
