SCP-1723, also known as "The Lawyer," is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face. Her eyes are a piercing blue hue and are reminiscent of those found on a clown, lending an eerie edge to her appearance. Her ears sport a green cross earring, adding to her overall eccentric style.

The most notable aspect of this SCP, however, is the normal gas mask that she wears at all times. It is unclear whether this is a purely aesthetic choice or whether there is a practical reason behind it, as she has never explained the reason for its use.

SCP-1723's personality is marked by a keen attention to detail, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, this tendency to obsess over getting the perfect present can lead to long periods of agonizing over the decision. Despite this tendency towards perfectionism, she is deeply observant and intuitive, able to pick up on subtle cues and body language that others might miss.

As a lawyer, SCP-1723 has an extensive knowledge of the law, which makes her a valuable asset in any legal case. Her abilities as a gifted communicator and persuader have made her known to win even the most challenging cases. However, her reliance on perfection can also make her stubborn and difficult to work with when things don't go according to plan.

Overall, SCP-1723's unique appearance and personality make her a fascinating addition to the urban fantasy landscape, brimming with intriguing possibilities.
