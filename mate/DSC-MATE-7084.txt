SCP-7084, also known as "The Salesman," is a male monkey, standing approximately 3 feet tall. SCP-7084's most prominent feature is its blue clown eyes, which are known to cause a mesmerizing effect on its victims as they gaze into them. SCP-7084 is often seen dressed smartly in a suit and tie, with a gold earring pierced through its left ear.

SCP-7084 is employed as a car salesman, working at a local dealership in the city. Despite its outwardly innocent appearance, SCP-7084 is a highly skilled manipulator, possessing a keen sense of persuasion and the ability to make deals that are too good to resist for its customers.

SCP-7084 is known to carry a silver chain necklace and a candy stick with it at all times, which it claims brings it good luck and helps it in making sales. However, it's observed that the candy stick possesses unusual properties that have yet to be explained, causing those who consume it to experience strange hallucinations.

SCP-7084 is highly intelligent and curious, with a thirst for knowledge that is unmatched by most of its monkey peers. It spends a lot of its free time reading and researching obscure topics, often collecting books, documentaries, and other educational materials. SCP-7084 can be quite passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with others, often using it as a tool to manipulate them into buying the cars it sells.

All personnel are to be cautious when dealing with SCP-7084, as it possesses highly manipulative and persuasive abilities. Under no circumstances should personnel offer it the candy stick or agree to its "too good to be true" deals, as it's highly likely that it's attempting to manipulate them for its own gain.
