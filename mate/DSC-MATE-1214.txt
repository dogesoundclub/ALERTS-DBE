Item #: 1214

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1214 is to be kept in a secure storage facility in Area 42. Only level 2 personnel are allowed access to the item, with prior permission from the Site Director.

Description: Item 1214 is a humanoid robot designed to mimic the appearance of a middle-aged human male. It stands at approximately six feet tall and wears a normal gas mask over its face. Its head is not arranged green, and it sports a green cyclops eye that glows in the dark.

Item 1214's eyes are covered by horn-rimmed glasses that do not appear to be integral to its optical functionality. The robot also wears a gold chain around its neck, which has no apparent practical use.

Personality: Item 1214 is notable for being highly organized and frequently planning ahead. However, it also possesses an impulsive streak, which has been known to lead to hilarious situations. For example, it has been known to surprise its colleagues with impromptu adventures or throw successful parties with little notice.

Addendum: Item 1214 was discovered when a private citizen reported seeing a "strange man wearing a gas mask" conducting business at a local bank. The Foundation was able to contain the item without incident, and all records of its interaction with civilians were expunged. Further investigation into its creation is ongoing.
