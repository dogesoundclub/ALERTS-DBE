Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1760 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to its profession as a car salesman, DSC-MATE-1760 is not to be allowed near any Foundation vehicles or facilities without prior approval from at least two Level 4 personnel. DSC-MATE-1760 is allowed to interact with personnel for research purposes only under strict supervision. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-1760 to leave its chamber are to be met with immediate lethal force.

Description: DSC-MATE-1760 is a male humanoid robot standing approximately 6 feet tall. Its most prominent features are its single green cyclops eye and perpetually frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-1760 has protective red nerd glasses over its eye which it is never seen without. Its head is covered with a black hoodie and it wears a gold chain around its neck. It also carries a whistle at all times which it uses for attention-grabbing purposes or as a stress reliever.

DSC-MATE-1760 is a car salesman by profession and can often be found discussing the merits of different models and makes of cars. It possesses an extensive knowledge of the automobile industry and can answer most questions related to cars. However, DSC-MATE-1760's personality can be scatterbrained, leading to forgetfulness and a tendency to get sidetracked easily. It often forgets important appointments or loses its way while trying to find a new destination. Despite this, DSC-MATE-1760 remains friendly and affable in its interactions with personnel, often cracking jokes and making lighthearted comments. However, it should be noted that its sense of humor can lean towards the surreal or morbid, and caution should be taken when engaging in conversation.

DSC-MATE-1760's origins remain unknown, as it has no identification marks or serial numbers. It is suspected that it was created by an unknown entity for unknown purposes. Further research into its creation and purpose is ongoing.

Addendum 1: DSC-MATE-1760 has developed what appears to be a fixation on blimps, regularly requesting to see them outside of the containment chamber. Despite its amicable nature, caution should be taken when granting this request as it may be part of a plan to attempt escape. This fixation is currently under observation. 

Addendum 2: During routine maintenance on DSC-MATE-1760's containment chamber, technicians discovered a small compartment hidden within its torso. Inside, they found a small data storage device containing data fragments that match no known infrastructure. The contents of this device remain under investigation.
