Item #: SCP-8189

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8189 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, with enrichment toys provided. Permission for access to SCP-8189 is granted only with Level 2 security clearance and a written request.

Description: SCP-8189 is a male monkey, approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighing 35 kilograms. Despite its animalistic appearance, SCP-8189 possesses a pair of VR Rainbow LED eyes, which cannot be removed or deactivated. Its head is not arranged green, as observed during initial capture.

The most distinctive feature of SCP-8189 is its unusual behavior. It displays a high level of intelligence, capable of communicating with humans through a vocabulary of over 500 words, which it learned from its observation of Officer ████████, whom it was assigned to. SCP-8189 has a very analytical and logical personality, and enjoys debating and arguing for pleasure.

Addendum 8189-A: On ██/██/████, Officer ████████ was injured in the line of duty and later died of his injuries. SCP-8189 has been exhibiting grieving behavior, such as eating less and withdrawing from interactions with staff.

Addendum 8189-B: SCP-8189 is often seen using a Candy Stick, which it is very protective of. Any attempts to take the Candy Stick away from SCP-8189 results in aggression, prompting researchers to speculate that the Candy Stick has significant sentimental value to SCP-8189.

Notes: SCP-8189's unique characteristics make it a valuable asset for studying interspecies communication and intelligence. However, staff must exercise caution when interacting with SCP-8189 to avoid causing any emotional distress.
