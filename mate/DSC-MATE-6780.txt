Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6780 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-6780 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. SCP-6780 is allowed access to legal resources in order to maintain their occupation as a lawyer.

Description: SCP-6780 is a human female with brown hair styled in a short, witch-like fashion. SCP-6780 has several distinct facial features, including spots on their cheeks, a purple lip, and orange eyebrows. SCP-6780 also wears goggles on their forehead and a gold earring in each ear. They are often seen wearing a silver chain.

SCP-6780 exhibits a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh through telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations. However, SCP-6780’s humor can often lead to humorous and unique legal strategies in court, causing surprise and turmoil for opposing lawyers. It is advised that legal proceedings involving SCP-6780 be carefully monitored to ensure that their humor does not cause an unprofessional atmosphere.

SCP-6780 has displayed no anomalous abilities at this time, though their unique appearance may cause discomfort or surprise for those who encounter them. SCP-6780 has expressed frustration with the inability to use their sense of humor in formal situations and often regards such environments as “killjoys.”

Addendum: SCP-6780 has requested to work specifically with cases involving anomalous individuals or events. While this request is approved, SCP-6780 is to be closely monitored to ensure they do not exploit their position to gain information on anomalous entities or events for personal gain.
