DSC-MATE-6010 is a human male, identified by the Foundation as a beautician. However, what sets DSC-MATE-6010 apart from other humans is its unique appearance. DSC-MATE-6010's mouth is marked by a spot, which appears to be a birthmark of sorts. But that is not all. DSC-MATE-6010's eyes are protected by a pair of ski goggles, something that would be more appropriate for a snowboarding trip than a workday at a beauty salon. Its head is always adorned by a retro cap, which seems to have been around for decades. But wait, there's more! DSC-MATE-6010 has a gold earring, which adds an additional layer of mystery to this already bizarre appearance. Finally, DSC-MATE-6010 wears a silver chain, which may have some symbolic meaning to the creature.

DSC-MATE-6010's personality is equally intriguing. It possesses a love for adventure, often taking risks and trying new things. However, this tendency towards reckless behavior has led to some amusing (and dangerous) incidents. The creature has survived multiple near-death experiences, such as bungee jumping mishaps or getting lost in the wilderness. The Foundation is still trying to determine if DSC-MATE-6010 is unaware of its own limitations, or if it has some sort of supernatural ability to cheat death. For now, DSC-MATE-6010's personality remains a mystery.
