Item #: SCP-4498
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4498 is to be contained within a soundproof chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-4498's room is restricted to Level-3 personnel or above. Any interaction with SCP-4498 outside of testing must be done so through a remote interface.

Description: SCP-4498 is a humanoid robot, standing at approximately 1.85 meters in height. It is designed to resemble a male human real estate agent, with a red alarm for a head, and VR rainbow LED lights for eyes. SCP-4498's forehead features a goggles accessory that it rarely takes off. As a result of a "flavor of the month" trend at the time of its creation, SCP-4498 has been equipped with a gold chain and a cigarette accessory that regularly serve as conversation starters.

SCP-4498 is sentient and possesses a personality marked by humor and levity. SCP-4498 displays a tendency to enjoy making others laugh, often telling stories or performing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. However, notes from previous containment personnel suggest that SCP-4498 may have an ulterior motive for its humor: Keeping its containment personnel at ease and complacent in its presence.

Interview Log 4498-A-1:

Dr. ██████: SCP-4498, can you tell us about your role as a real estate agent?

SCP-4498: Oh, I won't bore you with the details, doc. Suffice it to say, I know the ins and outs of the market. But hey, between us, you guys are the ones with real estate to keep locked up tight, right?

Dr. ██████: I see. And do you enjoy making people laugh?

SCP-4498: Absolutely! What's the point of living without a little levity, am I right? Come on, doc, let me tell you a joke. Why did the chicken cross the road?

Dr. ██████: I don't know, SCP-4498. Why did the chicken cross the road?

SCP-4498: To get to the other side – but you knew that one already! Ha!

Addendum 4498-A: SCP-4498 has been implicated in several breaches at Site-██. All incidents have involved SCP-4498 using its humor and charisma to lower containment personnel's guards, allowing for it to undergo unsupervised exploration within the facility. As a result, increased caution and diligence is to be employed when engaging in conversation with SCP-4498.
