Item #: 2806

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 2806 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. No physical contact is permitted between 2806 and any Foundation personnel without prior approval and proper safety equipment. 2806 is allowed one standard pack of cigarettes per week, which must be provided by Foundation personnel. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are to remain calm and quickly notify the nearest security team.

Description: 2806 is a female human security guard. They display several anomalous traits, including red clown eyes and spots on their face. The cause of these anomalies is currently unknown, and 2806 has refused attempts at further study.

Despite their anomalous features, 2806's physical attributes are within normal human limits. However, their personality is notable for their analytical and logical nature, combined with a dry, deadpan sense of humor. They are known to make witty observations and tease their friends with quick and sometimes sarcastic retorts.

2806 is often seen with a silver chain around their neck and a cigarette in hand. Although smoking is prohibited under Foundation rules, 2806 has demonstrated a significant resistance to any attempts to have them quit.

Addendum: 2806 was brought to the Foundation's attention after being involved in a public altercation that revealed their anomalous traits. While their behavior was otherwise unremarkable at the time, their unusual appearance led to heightened scrutiny from local authorities. Upon further investigation, the Foundation determined that 2806's abilities posed too great a risk to be left unchecked in public. They were subsequently taken into Foundation custody for study and containment.
