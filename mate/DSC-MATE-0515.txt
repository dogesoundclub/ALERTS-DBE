SCP-515, also known as "The Tiger Fast Food Worker," is a male tiger of unknown origin. Despite his species, he appears to have adapted to human culture, working as a fast food worker in an undisclosed location.

SCP-515's eyes are a unique feature, resembling ski goggles with reflective lenses. His head is adorned with a blue bandana, which he wears with pride. The tiger is often seen smoking cigarettes, as well as sporting a silver chain and red cross earring for added flair.

While SCP-515 appears to be a carefree and humorous individual, he possesses a risk-taking personality that can prove dangerous at times. He tends to make impulsive decisions, which can lead to humorous (and sometimes catastrophic) consequences. For example, he may jump off cliffs or into rivers without a second thought, much to the surprise of bystanders.

It is unknown how SCP-515 obtained his human-like qualities or his ability to incorporate himself into human society. It is advised to monitor his actions closely, as they may pose a threat to public safety.
