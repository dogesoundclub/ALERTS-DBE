Item #: SCP-1395

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1395 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation surveillance teams, and is to be accompanied by at least two armed guards when outside of its designated quarters. The Gas mask is to be kept on the subject at all times, and any attempts to remove it must be met with immediate force.

Description: SCP-1395 appears to be a male human in his mid-thirties, with an unusual set of physical attributes. The subject possesses a set of red clown eyes, a peak spike protruding from the top of his head, and a jade earring in each earlobe. His most distinctive feature, however, is a large, circular spot on the left side of his mouth.

SCP-1395's personality is characterized by its penchant for organization and planning, as well as a spontaneous streak that can lead to unexpected and often entertaining events. The subject has been known to surprise its friends and colleagues with impromptu adventures or parties, which are typically well-received.

However, the subject is also prone to erratic behavior and displays a marked resistance to authority. SCP-1395 has been known to disregard orders and engage in potentially dangerous activities, making it a challenge to effectively contain and control.

SCP-1395's gold chain seems to have no anomalous properties, and the subject has expressed a strong attachment to it. It is suspected that its normal appearance is a means of disarming those around it, or possibly as a symbol of the subject's defiance and individuality.

Addendum: Despite the subject's unusual appearance and behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that SCP-1395 is anything other than human. However, the origin and nature of its anomalous features remain unknown, and are the subject of ongoing research by Foundation teams.
