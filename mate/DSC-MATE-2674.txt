Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2674 is to be kept under surveillance while at work at [REDACTED], a fast food chain in [REDACTED]. Subject may not be allowed to handle cash, and all orders are to be audited for accuracy. In the event of an incident or violent outburst, security is to be called immediately.

Description: 
Subject 2674 appears to be a normal human male in his mid-twenties. He wears a doge hat on his head and sports a mouth spot on his face. His eyes are obscured by nerd glasses, and he wears a silver chain around his neck. He has a two-color band on his forehead and a gold earring in his right ear.

Subject 2674 exhibits a strong attention to detail, bordering on the obsessive. He alphabetizes his spice rack and color-codes his closet. This personality trait can manifest unexpectedly in his work at the fast-food restaurant, where he obsessively checks orders and ensures accuracy down to the smallest detail. Any error in an order may trigger an intense reaction from the subject and even result in physical violence.

Further research is needed to determine the cause of subject 2674's behavior and if it poses any threat to the public. Until then, minimal contact is advised.
