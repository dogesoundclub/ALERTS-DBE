SCP Foundation Description - Subject 5649, also known as "The Dreaming Farmer":

Classification: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5649 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with basic amenities. Due to their introspective nature, they are permitted to have access to books and writing materials in their cell, but no electronic devices or internet access. Regular psychological evaluations are to be conducted to monitor their mental state and any potential anomalous behavior.

Description: SCP-5649 is a human female, appearing to be in her mid-40s, with orange stripes on her face and a perpetual smile. Their head is a non-organic, metallic blue substance which cannot be identified, making it impossible to conduct any medical examinations on the brain without risking damage.

Subject exhibits a unique personality trait of being extremely introspective, often lost in thought or daydreaming for long periods of time. This has resulted in various comical mishaps such as walking into objects or tripping over their own feet. The cause of this trait is unknown but suspected to be due to the anomalous nature of the subject.

Subject is a successful farmer and is known to have remarkable knowledge in plant cultivation and irrigation techniques. However, the extent of their knowledge in agriculture is unclear due to their introverted personality.

Subject wears a gold chain around their neck at all times but claims it has no abnormal properties or significance.

Addendum: SCP-5649 has reported vivid and peculiar dreams during their sleep cycle, which seem to influence their thought process during the day. Further study is recommended.
