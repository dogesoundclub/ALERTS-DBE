**Item #:** 1167

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of the writing of this file, 1167 is to be detained within a standard humanoid containment chamber outfitted for primate comfort. Access to any communication devices are to be strictly prohibited, due to the danger of the potential misuse of said devices.

**Description:** 1167 is a politician of the species Macaca fascicularis, commonly known as the long-tailed macaque. It stands at 1.2 meters tall, and is consistently seen wearing a silver chain and a whistle at all times. The specimen appears to be in a constant state of fear, with a frightened mouth and clown-red eyes that seem to be constantly darting from object to object, with no sense of rationale.

Physically, 1167 appears to be a normal long-tailed macaque, aside from standard human-like hair on the head, and a singular gold earring on its right ear. However, it is its impetuous nature and tendency to act on emotion that renders it an anomalous entity.

**Personality:** 1167 suffers from a crippling impulsivity issue that often leads to spontaneous or erratic decisions that others may find amusing or illogical in nature. Due to this critical flaw, it is imperative that the specimen remain constantly supervised and monitored, as a sudden lapse of judgment could lead to potentially disastrous events. 

Despite their tendencies to act on emotion rather than reason, 1167 often exhibits a friendly and enthusiastic behavior that is almost child-like in nature, which may have contributed to its acquisition of its political office. 

It is advised that under no circumstance communication devices be supplied to 1167, as it may lead to grave circumstances that threaten the integrity of the Foundation's mission to protect humanity from the paranormal.
