Item #: SCP-3160

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3160 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Two armed guards are to be stationed outside of SCP-3160's cell at all times. As SCP-3160 is a skilled beautician, it is permitted to maintain its own grooming facilities within its cell. Any requests made by SCP-3160 must be approved by at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-3160 is a male monkey of the Cercopithecus genus, measuring approximately 1 meter in height and weighing 15 kg. SCP-3160 appears to be moderately skilled in the art of hair styling and grooming, using various tools and techniques to create aesthetically pleasing hairdos and make-up looks on other humanoid SCPs. SCP-3160's frightened mouth may suggest that it is not entirely comfortable in its containment and may be in distress.

SCP-3160 is known to wear a gold chain around its neck, though the significance of this accessory is unknown. SCP-3160 is generally calm and polite, though it has displayed some anxiety when it perceives a lack of control over its immediate surroundings.

SCP-3160 exhibits a creative and artistic side, often expressed through various hobbies or interests. SCP-3160 has been observed drawing, painting, and writing poetry in its free time. These activities appear to have a calming effect on SCP-3160, and may serve as a therapeutic outlet for its containment-related anxieties.

Due to its unique abilities and interests, SCP-3160 is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation, and is allowed to continue practicing its craft under close supervision. Any attempts by SCP-3160 to use its skills for malevolent purposes will result in disciplinary action.
