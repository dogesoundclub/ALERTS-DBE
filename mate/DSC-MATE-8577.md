Item #: 8577

Object Class: Human

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8577 has been identified as a Real Estate Agent, and as such, poses no direct threat to the public. However, agents are advised to avoid prolonged contact with this individual, as it has a tendency to over-explain even the most mundane of details. Subject 8577 is currently unaffiliated with any known organizations, but its tendency towards traditionalism may make it a ripe target for recruitment by any groups with a similar agenda.

Description: Subject 8577 is a male human of indeterminate age, typically found wearing a Doge hat and a medical mask. Its eyes are obscured by normal-looking glasses, and its ears are adorned with a green cross earring. The subject's most notable trait is a large, red scarf that it typically wears wrapped around its neck.

Personality: Subject 8577 displays a strong tendency towards traditionalism and values, drawing heavily on the beliefs and customs of its family or community. This manifests as a somewhat no-nonsense attitude, though it has a definite playful side that it isn't afraid to show off. Subject 8577 is fond of telling jokes and stories passed down through its family, and while they are often amusing, they can also veer dangerously close to the bizarre or absurd.

Addendum: Despite its seemingly benign nature, recent surveillance has detected a series of encrypted communications between Subject 8577 and unknown sources. Further investigation is needed to determine the significance of these communications.
