Special Containment Procedures: Item 1549 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The LED gas mask is to be kept locked in a separate containment locker when not in use. Any communication with Item 1549 must be monitored by security personnel at all times.

Description: Item 1549 is a human female, with several distinct facial features. The face is covered in spots, with red clown eyes and red lips. They are often seen wearing a tiara and a pair of jade earrings. Along with that, the subject wears a gold chain around their neck.

Despite their peculiar appearance, Item 1549 has mostly been cooperative with the Foundation since recovery. They have shown a keen interest in analyzing and debating various topics with the staff. It is advised to indulge in their argumentative nature to keep them calm and cooperative.

However, it is important to keep in mind that they have a tendency to get carried away with the debates, and it is recommended to restrict the topics to avoid triggering an emotional response.

Addendum: It is not clear how Item 1549 acquired their unique appearance, but they have stated that their profession was a farmer before containment. Further investigation into their background is underway.
