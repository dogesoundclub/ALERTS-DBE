Item #: SCP-7162

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7162 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with additional reinforcing to withstand the strength and agility of its species. Access to electronic communication devices is strictly prohibited. Any attempts at communication should be monitored by at least one Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-7162 is a tiger that walks on two legs, with an unusual headset embedded in its head. The headset appears to be a sophisticated communication device with built-in LED lights that vary in color depending on the message being transmitted. The headset cannot be removed even under extreme force.

SCP-7162 possesses a hyper-analytical mind and exhibits remarkable logical reasoning abilities. However, it also displays an uncommonly quirky sense of humor and a predisposition for teasing others. SCP-7162 often makes witty, dry, and deadpan observations that may not be well-received by friends and colleagues.

The creature claims to be the manager of the [REDACTED] Theater, although there is no record of such a venue existing. To date, no one has been able to prove or disprove SCP-7162's claim.

SCP-7162 is a carnivore but appears not to need food to survive. Despite this, it enjoys devouring steak and other meat products allowed for consumption by its dietary restrictions.

Addendum: Research into SCP-7162's origin is still ongoing, and its unusual abilities warrant its classification as Euclid.

Discovery: SCP-7162 was brought to the Foundation's attention after several complaints about a talking tiger on the loose that had infiltrated corporate offices and entertainment venues. An MTF squad specialized in urban fantasy was dispatched, and SCP-7162 was captured without incident.
