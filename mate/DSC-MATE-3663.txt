SCP-3663, also known as "Doctor Hopper", has been identified as a male rabbit of an unknown species, with striking red clown eyes that are both mesmerizing and terrifying at the same time. SCP-3663 has a distinctively green head that seems to be in a constant state of disarray, giving off the impression of a frenzied and chaotic personality. The rabbit's ears are adorned with a single gold earring, which is said to be a symbol of the rabbit's whimsical nature.

SCP-3663 has been observed to frequently carry a lit cigarette in its mouth, despite the fact that rabbits are known to have a strict vegetarian diet. How SCP-3663 acquired this peculiar habit remains unknown; however, it may be linked to the rabbit's impulsive nature.

SCP-3663's personality is characterized by a tendency to act on its emotions rather than thinking things through. This impulsivity can lead to some amusing situations that others find humorous or surprising. Despite his erratic nature, SCP-3663 has managed to gain a reputation as a skilled doctor, offering medical services to both humans and supernatural beings alike.

SCP-3663's unpredictability and lack of disregard for his own safety or well-being make him a challenging entity to contain. Despite his benign nature, personnel are instructed to handle SCP-3663 with caution, as his impulsive behavior can potentially lead to unpredictable and hazardous situations.
