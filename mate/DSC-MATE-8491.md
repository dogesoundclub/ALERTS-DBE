Item #: 8491

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8491 is to be kept in a soundproof containment chamber designed to mimic the natural habitat of rabbits. The chamber should be furnished with a variety of enrichment items, such as various toys and tunnels, to encourage mental stimulation. Food and water should also be provided daily.

Whenever 8491 is transported for legal proceedings, it must be kept in a metal crate with minimal windows. Personnel handling 8491 must wear earplugs to muffle its unique ability to produce sound waves that can cause hallucinations or auditory paralysis.

Description: 8491 is a male rabbit of the Leporidae family, weighing approximately 2.5 kilograms. It possesses ski goggle eyes, fur in the form of a hoodie, and wears a gold chain and LED gas mask accessories.

Unlike other rabbits, 8491 has the remarkable capability of altering its sound waves to produce a wide range of auditory effects. At high volumes, its sound waves can cause severe migraine headaches, hallucinations or auditory paralysis. Additionally, 8491 appears to have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, coupled with a humorous side that encourages the desire to create trickster situations.

Personality: 8491 displays a complex mix of traits, being both playful and responsible at the same time. It has a strong sense of justice and an innate ability to detect lies, making it a useful ally to those who seek the truth.

In social situations, 8491 often shows its playful side, making it the life of the party, getting everyone to dance or sing along to its favorite songs. However, under stress, it will often resort to its auditory abilities, which can be extremely dangerous.

Addendum: 8491 is permitted to use its unique abilities in court proceedings to detect lies, making it a valuable resource to law enforcement. However, whenever it is released on parole, its gas mask must be replaced with a standard rabbit mask to prevent any accidental harm caused by its abilities.
