Item #: 8079

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8079 is to be kept within Site-17's primate containment unit at all times. The subject is to be monitored by Level 2 Security Personnel at all times and any interaction with the subject is to be recorded for future behavioral analysis. Subject 8079 is to be provided with a suitable amount of mental stimulation in the form of puzzles, games, and toys to prevent boredom and potential behavior issues.

Description: Subject 8079 appears to be a male, common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) measuring approximately 120 centimeters in height and weighing approximately 80 kilograms. The subject is distinguishable from other common chimpanzees by its habit of wearing a retro cap and a red scarf. The subject's personality is characterized by a tendency to become absent-minded and forgetful when engrossed in thought or during work-related activities.

Personality: While subject 8079's absent-minded tendencies are a cause of concern for its effective performance as a security guard, its humorous behavior and endearing personality have endeared it to personnel at Site-17. The subject's forgetfulness and difficulty with timekeeping have led to several amusing incidents, though it should be noted that in high-pressure situations, the subject has been known to exhibit a heightened sense of focus and urgency.

In accordance with the DogeSoundClub's charter of protecting humanity from supernatural threats, subject 8079 has been employed as a security guard at Site-17 due to its excellent physical capabilities and natural instincts. However, given its limitations in terms of memory and focus, subject 8079 is monitored at all times to prevent any possible breaches of containment.

Addendum: It should be noted that subject 8079 has succeeded in preventing several potential breaches of containment at Site-17, using its keen senses and physical prowess to maintain a secure perimeter around the facility. Nevertheless, the subject's employment has been approved on a probationary basis, and the effects of its absent-mindedness on its effectiveness as a security guard are being closely monitored.
