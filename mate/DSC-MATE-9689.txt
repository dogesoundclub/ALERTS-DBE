SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-9689

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9689 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject is to be monitored at all times, through both visual and audio surveillance. All personnel entering the containment chamber must be authorized and accompanied by at least two armed guards. The subject's access to any kind of impulsive or dangerous activity must be strictly monitored and controlled. Any actions in violation of this directive must be reported immediately to the Site Supervisor.

Description: SCP-9689 is a humanoid male identified as a police officer by profession. The subject's face is distinctive, with orange stripes and a permanent smile. SCP-9689 has normal eyesight, and wears glasses as its preferred accessory. The subject's head is adorned with green hair, which is always kept under a purple cap. SCP-9689 also wears a red victory band on its forehead, and a jade earring on each ear.

SCP-9689's most prominent feature is its tendency towards impulsiveness and risk-taking. It has been observed to engage in activities without proper forethought, such as jumping off cliffs, diving into unknown waters, or breaking into secured facilities. SCP-9689 regards these actions as normal, and often displays an amused or carefree attitude towards danger.

The subject's behavior suggests a lack of concern for personal safety, or disregard for consequences. SCP-9689's motivations for such acts remain unclear, and it seems to derive pleasure from these experiences. This makes SCP-9689 highly unpredictable and an extreme risk to both itself and those around it.

Addendum 9689-1: SCP-9689 was discovered during a police raid on a criminal hideout. The subject was one of the arresting officers, and was observed to exhibit erratic and dangerous behavior during the operation. A subsequent investigation identified SCP-9689 as an anomalous individual, and Foundation agents were dispatched to contain and study the subject.

Attempts to interact with SCP-9689 to determine its motive or origin have so far been unsuccessful. The subject's behavior remains enigmatic and elusive, and its containment and surveillance must be maintained with the utmost care.
