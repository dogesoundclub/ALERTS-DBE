Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1949 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls and ceiling. The chamber must be equipped with a personal computer, a sound system, and several potted plants. Subject is allowed access to his personal computer during recreation. Any and all communication with Subject must be carried out through an intercom system.

Description: Subject 1949 is a male humanoid creature of the species Panthera Tigris with a visibly frightened mouth and red clown eyes. He is adorned in a black hoodie with a red victory band on his forehead, and his mouth is covered by a medical mask. He wears a silver chain around his neck. 

Subject 1949â€™s personality is that of a caring and nurturing individual, often extending this behavior towards even inanimate objects such as plants and household appliances. He has been observed to give names to his belongings and appears to anthropomorphize them.

Subject is employed as a security guard and displays exceptional professionalism when executing his duty. His anomalous properties do not interfere with his job; however, it is recommended that his supervisors be made aware of his containment.

Addendum: It has been noted that Subject 1949 has a propensity for being talkative, and while this may seem innocuous, caution must be exercised as the subject may share containment procedures and sensitive information.
