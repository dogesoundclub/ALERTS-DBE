Item #: 9560

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9560 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage reinforced with bars of titanium in a secure quarantine facility within Site-██. No physical contact is to be made with 9560 under any circumstances. It is vital to maintain a safe clearance distance of at least 10 meters from the subject to avoid alerting its extraordinary spontaneous capabilities.

Description: Item 9560 is a male monkey villain whose appearance is beyond extraordinary. It sports a sharp mohawk and horned-rim glasses over its sharp, piercing eyes. Its ears adorned with gold earrings, it's often seen wearing a silver chain. It's capable of speech and has been known to communicate effectively.

9560's spontaneous powers are yet to be fully understood, as research personnel have struggled to document its powers. Its love for adventure and risk-taking has led to various comic incidents such as narrowly averting death stemming from a bungee jumping accident or accidentally getting lost in a wilderness area.

Addendum: Item 9560's powers make it a valuable candidate for the department, particularly for its ability to infiltrate and conduct confirmed experimentation with human subjects. However, to do so could prove incredibly risky and endanger human life. A formal proposal for experimentation with Item-9560 on Class-D personnel has been forwarded to the Ethics Committee. Pending their approval, further testing may commence.
