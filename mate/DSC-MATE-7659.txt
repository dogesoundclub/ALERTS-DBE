Item #: SCP-7659

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7659 is to be monitored only for its activity and actions within the human world. SCP-7659 is to be free to roam within designated living quarters with no restrictions on its movement as long as it does not approach within a certain distance of civilian infrastructure.

Description: SCP-7659 is a white male tiger of the Bengal subspecies. In its natural form, SCP-7659 presents with a frightened mouth and horned rim glasses for eyes. It is covered in fur with a doge hat on its head and a gold earring in its right ear. SCP-7659 has a philosophical attitude towards life and enjoys challenging conventional wisdom within its species. 

SCP-7659 exhibits an artistic and creative side to its personality, often taking on various hobbies or interests. It has been observed painting and drawing, sometimes for hours. SCP-7659 enjoys expressing itself through other forms of artistic expression such as writing poetry and music.

Despite its creative nature, SCP-7659 is still a formidable predator with all the physical powers and abilities of a full-grown Bengal tiger. Its intelligence and creativity have enhanced its hunting methods within the human world, often utilizing its perceived weakness in its frightened mouth as a means of deception.

SCP-7659's creative abilities have been studied as a possible means of introducing a hybrid form of carnivorous animals into urban environments. However, it is the opinion of the SCP Foundation that SCP-7659's artistic nature is a unique feature of its personality and should not be compromised. 

Addendum: SCP-7659 presented the Foundation with a series of drawings of what it called "Doorways to alternate dimensions." The drawings depict what appear to be entrances to various other worlds or dimensions. Further investigation is currently planned.
