Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained within the confines of the local police department, monitored at all times for any signs of unusual behavior or manifestation of supernatural abilities. They are allowed to continue their work as a police officer, but must report any strange activity to their assigned Supervisor immediately. Under no circumstances must subject be allowed to access any confidential or top-secret information.

Description: Subject 504 is a human female, standing at an average height with a lean and athletic build. Her most prominent feature is her purple lips, which seem to be a natural occurrence rather than the result of any intentional cosmetic procedure. She is mostly seen sporting striking green hair held together underneath a purple cap. On her forehead, she is frequently seen with a pair of goggles pushed up in her hair. She also sports a pair of intricate jade earrings and a gold chain.

Subject 504 is known to possess a strong sense of intuition that borders on clairvoyance. Her predictions seem to materialize without error, often to the point of predicting a person's fears, anxieties, or mood shifts. Her ability to sense and predict situations has proven to be invaluable during investigations, making her a tenacious police officer.

However, it is unknown whether this ability is a result of a supernatural curse or a variation of a mundane power that can be explained by science. Her colleagues remain wary of her, with some even branding her as an eccentric, due to the mysterious nature of her abilities.

Based on the biographical notes of her past, subject 504 did show some tendency towards psychic powers, but the extent of her abilities has not yet been fully determined.
