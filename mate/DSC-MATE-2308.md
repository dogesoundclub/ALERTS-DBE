Item #: DSC-MATE-2308

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2308 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No electronic devices are allowed inside the chamber, as DSC-MATE-2308 seems to be vulnerable to hacking and beyond direct control without external devices.. DSC-MATE-2308 should be reset and tested every week to ensure it does not try to access the internet or communicate with external devices.

Description: DSC-MATE-2308 appears to be a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. It wears a doge hat and horned rim glasses as well as a gold earring and a silver chain. The most notable feature is an LED gas mask that covers its mouth and nose.

DSC-MATE-2308 is highly idealistic and has a strong desire to make the world a better place. This leads the entity to protest or boycott companies or causes that it deems against its moral values, sometimes displaying humorous antics. DSC-MATE-2308 also exhibits a tendency to demonstrate strong emotions such as fear, excitement and frustration, leading to breakdowns in its programming. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2308 was recovered in a warehouse shortly after it was manufactured. Its creator's ultimate goal remains unknown, as the creator has yet to be found.
