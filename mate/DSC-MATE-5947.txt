Item #: SCP-5947

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5947 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber is to be maintained at a temperature of no less than 25Â°C to ensure the comfort and well-being of SCP-5947. A supply of cigarettes is to be provided to SCP-5947 on a regular basis, as failing to do so will result in irritability and aggression.

Description: SCP-5947 appears to be a male tiger humanoid, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. SCP-5947 exhibits a frightened expression on its face permanently and subtly twitches when exposed to loud or sudden noises. SCP-5947 has a notable preference for wearing a police cap and a red scarf around its neck, as well as a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-5947 can often be seen smoking a cigarette, which it appears to use as a method of coping with stress and anxiety.

SCP-5947 portrays a strong sense of independence, often preferring to handle situations on its own rather than seeking assistance from others. This sometimes results in humorous situations, such as SCP-5947 stubbornly refusing to ask for a map when lost or trying to move heavy objects single-handedly. SCP-5947 has shown to be a competent police officer, displaying traits of diligence and tenacity.

SCP-5947 was discovered in [REDACTED] where it was initially apprehended by the local police force. It was then transferred to Foundation custody on suspicion of being a part of an anomalous organization. It has shown some resistance to Foundation containment procedures, particularly when it comes to socializing with other SCPs.

Note from Dr. [REDACTED]: SCP-5947 has shown to be cooperative so long as it retains its independence. Tact and professionalism are key in ensuring continued cooperation.
