Item #: 8696

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8696 is to be kept under 24/7 surveillance at all times. All interactions with 8696 must be recorded and analyzed for any signs of anomalous activity. The subject is to be housed within a specially reinforced containment cell with no less than three armed guards posted outside at all times.

Description: 8696 appears to be a male human of average build and height, with distinctive orange stripes covering his face. His eyes resemble ski goggles and his head is usually adorned with an old-school short peak cap. 8696 is easily recognizable by his green cross earring and penchant for sucking on a candy stick.

Personality: 8696 is a highly sociable individual, with a love for being the center of attention. They have a natural charm and humor that can be infectious, often leaving those in their presence with a smile on their face. However, their penchant for being the life of the party can sometimes lead to untoward situations.

The Foundation has reason to believe that 8696 is a high-ranking member of the mafia, with significant ties to organized crime across several continents. Due to their charm and social aptitude, they have been able to evade the authorities for years, slipping in and out of danger with ease.

Caution: 8696 is not to be underestimated. Despite their friendly demeanor, they are highly intelligent and manipulative, with a predilection towards violence when their interests are threatened. Any attempts at interaction with 8696 must be treated with extreme care and a healthy dose of skepticism.

Addendum: Research is currently underway to determine if 8696's anomalous properties extend beyond their charismatic personality and distinct appearance. The possibility of mind-altering capabilities or other forms of supernatural influence cannot be ruled out at this time.
