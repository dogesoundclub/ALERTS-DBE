SCP-2252, also known as "The Primate Picasso," is a male monkey of unknown origin that works as a car salesman in the outskirts of the city. Despite his jovial personality and charming demeanor, SCP-2252 possess an unusual set of physical traits, including piercing blue clown eyes, a red beanie on his head, and a gold earring on his left ear. 

Often seen sporting a golden chain around his neck, SCP-2252 has a penchant for art, expressing his creative side through various forms of artistic expression such as painting, drawing, and writing. It is unclear how SCP-2252 developed these creative abilities, but it is believed that it may have mystical origins, as his artwork has been known to possess anomalous properties.

Instances of SCP-2252's artwork have been found to cause hallucinations, emotional outbursts, and even strange physical effects, such as rapid hair growth and temporary limb paralysis. Despite these effects, SCP-2252 appears to be unaware of the abnormal properties of his art and continues to create pieces that are highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts alike.

Attempts to contain SCP-2252 have proven difficult due to his ability to blend in with human society, and his status as a car salesman has allowed him to interact with a variety of individuals without raising suspicion. Personnel are advised to approach SCP-2252 with caution and to avoid contact with any artwork created by him unless authorized by Level 4 clearance.
