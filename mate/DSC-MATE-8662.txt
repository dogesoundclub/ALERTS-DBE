SCP-8662, also known as "The Beautician," is a human female of unknown age and origin. Despite her mundane job as a beautician, she possesses a unique set of traits that are unlike ordinary humans. Her face bears a perpetual smile, an unnerving feature that seems to be unaffected by changes in mood or emotion. Her head is covered in unkempt, verdant hair that is not arranged in any discernible pattern.

SCP-8662's ears are decorated with a pair of gold earrings, which she never removes. She wears a gold chain around her neck, and often carries a cigarette between her lips, emitting puffs of smoke that seem to form strange shapes and symbols in the air. Her personality is that of an artist, one who possesses an innate creativity that she expresses through various hobbies and interests, including painting, drawing, writing, and other forms of artistic expression.

SCP-8662's abilities are not fully understood, but it is believed that her artistic talents are linked to her anomalous properties. Her paintings and drawings have been known to affect those who view them, inducing feelings of euphoria or dread, depending on the intent behind them. Her writing, similarly, appears to have a hypnotic effect on the reader, leading to altered states of consciousness and heightened suggestibility.

SCP-8662 is to be contained in an Artistic Anomalies Wing, where she can create and express herself without endangering Foundation personnel or the general public. Access to her artwork and writings is strictly forbidden, as they are considered cognitohazardous and have the potential to cause psychological harm. All interactions with SCP-8662 should be conducted with extreme caution, as her anomalous properties are still not fully understood.
