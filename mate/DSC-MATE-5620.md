Item #: 5620

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5620 is to be kept on site at its farmhouse residence. The subject is a simple, unassuming human farmer, lacking any known anomalous properties. However, the subject is known to have a tendency to craft unconventional solutions to problems, and Foundation personnel should remain cautious while interacting with the item.

Description: Item 5620 is a male human with the unique feature of a mouth spot and a constant, friendly smile. The subject's eyes emit a subtle jade green LED light, creating a surreal feeling in those who meet their gaze. The subject's head is topped with a crimson beanie, with goggles placed firmly above the forehead.

Item 5620 is a hands-on and pragmatic person, with a tendency to fix things outside of conventional methods. He frequently uses paperclips and duct tape to repair broken objects and will often assemble makeshift solutions to problems. These unorthodox methods often prove successful and have earned him the reputation of being a skilled and reliable farmer in his community.

The subject is often seen with a jade earring and a red scarf around his neck, along with a favorite candy stick, which he cherishes dearly. While the object is not hostile, Foundation personnel should remain cautious when interacting with them, as their resourceful nature may create unforeseen consequences.

Addendum: At the request of Item 5620, the Foundation has allowed them continued access to their farmhouse and farmland, under the condition that they keep the area under the Foundation's watchful eye. The subject has expressed a desire to continue their agricultural work and lead a peaceful life, which the Foundation views as mutually beneficial.
