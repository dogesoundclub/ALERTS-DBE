SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-5373

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5373 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-███. It is to be provided with everyday amenities and food necessary for human sustenance. Behavioral observations of SCP-5373 must be performed regularly in order to detect potential changes that would require further containment measures.

Description: SCP-5373 is a male human of average height and build, with distinctive orange stripes on his face. These stripes are a unique facial feature that is not consistent with any known human genetic marker. SCP-5373's most striking feature is its blue clown eyes, which are a result of a rare genetic mutation. Its head is usually covered with a retro cap, and it wears a green cross earring in its left ear. SCP-5373 frequently accessorizes with a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-5373 is generally known to be an empathetic and compassionate individual, always willing to help others in need. However, it has a tendency to become overly invested and involved in the problems of those around it, often leading to emotional exhaustion. This trait can render SCP-5373 vulnerable to psychic manipulation and influence.

Occasionally, SCP-5373 may exhibit signs of emotional instability, such as rapid mood swings and hallucinations. It is advised to approach SCP-5373 with caution during these episodes, as they may become violent and unpredictable.

Addendum: Testing has revealed that SCP-5373 possesses no anomalous abilities or abilities beyond that of a regular human. Investigation of its unique facial and eye characteristics continue.
