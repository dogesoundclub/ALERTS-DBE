SCP-2212, codenamed "Doctor Spot", is a human female who works as a doctor in the urban areas. Her most prominent features are the multiple spots that adorn her face and the bold red lip that frames her mouth, giving her a striking appearance that draws attention wherever she goes. Additionally, she always sports a white bucket hat and a red cross earring on one ear, signifying her commitment to the medical profession.

However, what truly sets SCP-2212 apart from the rest is the medical mask that always covers her mouth, adding an air of mystery and intrigue to her presence. Those who have seen her without it claim that her smile is infectious, and that she has a contagious laugh that can bring humor to even the most serious of situations. It is not uncommon for her to become the center of attention during social gatherings, regaling others with witty stories and jokes that leave everyone in stitches.

Despite her outgoing nature, SCP-2212 takes her profession very seriously, always carrying a gold chain that holds a medical symbol pendant, symbolizing her dedication to the healing arts. When it comes to her patients, she is empathetic and quick-witted, with a keen eye for diagnosing even the most complex of conditions. However, the true extent of SCP-2212's abilities is yet to be fully explored, leaving many to wonder what other secrets she may be hiding behind her medical mask.
