Item #: DSC-MATE-5492

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5492 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to any communication devices such as phones or computers is strictly prohibited. Personnel must monitor DSC-MATE-5492's movements during free time to ensure they do not attempt to make contact with the outside world.

Description: DSC-MATE-5492 is a human female in their late thirties, standing at 5'8" and weighing approximately 155 pounds. DSC-MATE-5492 possesses distinctive purple lips and wears normal glasses, witch short hair, gold earrings, and is almost always seen with a lit cigarette. 

DSC-MATE-5492's most notable traits include their forgetfulness and absent-mindedness, which can cause disruptions in daily tasks and responsibilities. It is believed that they possess a natural ability to manipulate time and space within the mind, leading to occasional cognitive lapses that can impact their work and decision-making processes.

DSC-MATE-5492's occupation as a theater manager provides an ideal cover for their anomalous tendencies, as a lack of punctuality and forgetfulness could easily be explained away as simple negligence. However, it is important to note that DSC-MATE-5492's powers must be monitored closely, as outside manipulation or exploitation could cause catastrophic effects on reality as we know it.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5492 has displayed an increased interest in urban fantasy novels recently. Further investigation into this matter is ongoing.
