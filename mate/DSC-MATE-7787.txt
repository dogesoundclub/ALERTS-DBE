Item #: 7787

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7787 should be monitored from a distance and only approached with caution. Any unauthorized physical contact can result in violent allergic reactions due to the peculiar nature of their appearance. Subject 7787 must always wear their LED Gas Mask as not to harm others with their noxious breath. Any injury caused to 7787 during SCP Foundation studies and experiments must be tended to promptly to avoid lethal reactions that could cause a catastrophic containment breach.

Description: SCP 7787 is a human female with abnormally bright blue clown eyes and spotted face features. Additionally, they sport a red cross earring on one ear. These physical traits are bizarre for a human, but are not deemed as hazardous in themselves. However, the subject’s unique traits manifest themselves in their personality. They possess a prodigious emotional intelligence, often experiencing deep empathy and an almost painful level of sensitivity to others’ feelings. They are emotionally unstable when they witness emotional pain and suffering, which can often result in violent reactions.

Additionally, subject 7787 has a fondness for animals and nature that makes them unpredictable and concerning. This fondness, while not inherently dangerous, has led 7787 to exhibit irrational behavior in pursuit of animal or ecological conservation. SCP Foundation researchers must be cautious of 7787’s unpredictability when conducting studies or experiments.

Addendum: Subject 7787's programming abilities, while not inherently anomalous, have been used to facilitate the development of multiple projects for the SCP Foundation. However, the subject must be carefully monitored and their work reviewed, as they have demonstrated a tendency toward a lack of attention to detail which has the potential to lead to dangerous errors.
