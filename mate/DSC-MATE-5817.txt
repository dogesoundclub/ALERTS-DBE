Item #: 5817

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-5817 is to be contained in a standard human containment cell, with access to a fully equipped veterinarian office. The subject is allowed to retain its gold earring and gold chain, but the candy stick has been removed for safety measures. Access to the subject is granted only to personnel with level 2 clearance or higher.

Description:

SCP-5817 is a human male of average height and weight, with orange stripes on its face and a frightened mouth. Its head appears to be metal, purple in colour, and is cold to the touch. SCP-5817 wears a gold earring in its left ear and a gold chain around its neck. Its most notable feature is its reluctance to seek help, even when it is necessary.

SCP-5817's primary occupation is that of a veterinarian, and it possesses a vast knowledge of various animal species. It demonstrates exceptional ability in treating animals with illnesses, injuries or behaviours that are deemed out of the ordinary, often leading to its use in the containment and study of anomalous animal species. 

However, its reluctance to ask for assistance in matters outside of its expertise often leads SCP-5817 to engage in humorous, if not dangerous incidents. Such instances include moving heavy furniture without help or navigating unknown locations without the use of maps.

SCP-5817 has displayed no anomalous properties related to its physical features, and further investigations into the origin of its metal head have been inconclusive. The subject is cooperative during testing and interviews, but it has shown to be highly protective of the animals it treats, often resisting their removal from its care.

Addendum:

SCP-5817's unique abilities, combined with its loyalty towards animals, have made it an invaluable asset in the containment and research of various anomalous animal species, including SCP-999 and SCP-049. Therefore, should a crises situation arise, its containment procedures may be re-evaluated.
