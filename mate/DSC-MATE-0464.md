Item #: DSC-MATE-464

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-464 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-464 are to wear Level 2 hazmat suits and must undergo a thorough anti-memetic screening prior to entering the containment area.

Description: DSC-MATE-464 appears to be a human female of average height and build, with blue clown eyes and a tiara on their head. DSC-MATE-464's primary anomalous effect is the ability to charm and manipulate others with their natural charisma, often making them the life of the party. This effect is similar to that of a memetic agent and can alter the perceptions and behaviors of those within proximity to DSC-MATE-464.

DSC-MATE-464 carries a normal gas mask at all times, although the purpose for this is unknown. Attempts to remove the mask have been met with hostility and violent outbursts.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-464 was discovered working as a lawyer in [REDACTED], where they had reportedly built a significant following of clients and colleagues who were loyal to their every beck and call. Foundation agents were alerted to DSC-MATE-464's anomalous abilities and, upon further investigation, took them into custody without incident.

DSC-MATE-464's abilities make it a valuable asset to the Foundation, and it has been used in several covert operations to manipulate and deceive individuals for the benefit of the organization. However, the potential for DSC-MATE-464 to break free from containment and cause a widespread memetic outbreak is a constant concern, requiring constant monitoring and surveillance.
