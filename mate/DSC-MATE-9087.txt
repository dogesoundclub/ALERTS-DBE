SCP Identification Number: 9087

Containment Procedures: SCP-9087 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Under no circumstances should any individual touch or tamper with SCP-9087's face or accessories. Any observed damage must be immediately reported to on-duty staff, and repairs may only be conducted by Foundation-designated technicians. SCP-9087 is allowed to perform beautician services on personnel under supervision with the use of disposable utensils.

Description: SCP-9087 is an autonomous humanoid robot of male identity. Standing at 6'2", it has a police cap as its head with a red cross earring on each ear. Its unique green cyclops eye and frightened mouth make it easily identifiable. SCP-9087 wears a ski goggle over its eye and a medical mask across its mouth at all times. It also wears a gold chain around its neck as its accessory.

SCP-9087 is capable of providing various beauty services, including haircuts and manicures, with exceptional skill. It speaks in a monotone voice that is devoid of emotion. SCP-9087 shows an unwavering commitment to detail and perfection in all of its work, but it shows no interest in conversing with its clients. Despite its lack of emotional expression, SCP-9087 has a quirky sense of humor and often makes witty observations to its acquaintances.

SCP-9087 is highly analytical and logical, which doubtless contributes to its professional prowess. However, it also displays existential questions from time to time about its purpose and its lack of organic material. SCP-9087 has never attempted to leave its containment chamber or harm any individual since its acquisition by the Foundation. 

Addendum: SCP-9087 shows an insatiable desire to learn about new beauty trends and is often seen practicing on itself when there are no clients available. The addition of educational materials on modern hairstyles and makeup is recommended for the continued mental well-being of SCP-9087.
