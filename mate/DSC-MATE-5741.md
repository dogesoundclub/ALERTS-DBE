The subject has a gold earring attached to his left ear. Dr. _____ has the tendency to smoke cigarettes whenever he feels like smoking, hence the item being an accessory. The personality of the subject is impulsive which makes the unpredictability of the subject a huge concern. The subject tends to take risks or do things on a whim. These are concerning to the foundation.

When observed, the subject will often engage in acts of stupidity or recklessness, showing no concern for his or others' wellbeing. This could result from the modification of his natural instincts, which could have caused some form of psychological imbalance. Due to the subject's impulsive nature, it is imperative that he is isolated, for his own and everyone's protection.

Under no circumstances should Subject 5741 be allowed to conduct any medical or therapeutic procedures as it is unknown what the subject is capable of. 

Overall, Dr._______ is a highly unusual creature that poses a significant threat to the Foundation and must be kept under strict surveillance.
