Item #: SCP-6145

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6145 is to be confined to a supervised living area on-site at its current place of employment as Theater Manager of [REDACTED]. SCP-6145 is not to leave the property for any reason unless accompanied by at least two Foundation personnel. 

Description: SCP-6145 is a female human of average height and weight with orange eyebrows and a distinctive two-color band on her forehead. SCP-6145 is often seen wearing a normal gas mask and a green cross earring on each ear. A choker is also frequently worn. SCP-6145 exhibits a friendly and outgoing personality, typically with a constant smile on her face, but can be absent-minded and forgetful, especially when lost in thought or focused on a project. 

SCP-6145's forgetfulness has been observed to lead to humorous situations, such as forgetting appointments or losing track of time and missing important events. However, these tendencies have also proven to be a safety concern, as SCP-6145 has been known to become distracted or forget vital safety protocols. 

SCP-6145's work as Theater Manager has been monitored, and it has been noted that SCP-6145's ability to manage its staff and productions is exceptional, leading to consistently packed audiences and rave reviews. However, SCP-6145 has also exhibited a fascination with subjects outside of the theater world and a tendency to incorporate potentially dangerous elements into productions, such as replicating dangerous stunts or using hazardous materials. 

Addendum: SCP-6145's goggles on its forehead have been found to provide no functional use and appear to be worn purely for aesthetic reasons. Further study into the origins and purpose of SCP-6145's unique and potentially anomalous features is ongoing.
