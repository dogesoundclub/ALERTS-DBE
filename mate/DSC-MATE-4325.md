Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4325 is to be contained within a secure humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Only personnel with level 3 clearance or higher are permitted to enter DSC-MATE-4325's chamber. Any requests made by DSC-MATE-4325 to leave the chamber must be approved by at least two level 4 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-4325 is a robotic police officer with a retro cap on his head and a green cyclops eye. He stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 70 kilograms. His body is made of a combination of metal alloys and plastic materials.

DSC-MATE-4325's primary sensory input comes from his VR jade LED eyes, which allow him to process information quickly and accurately. He wears a jade earring in one ear and a silver chain around his neck. He also carries a whistle as part of his police gear.

DSC-MATE-4325 has shown a tendency to be scatterbrained and forgetful, leading to humorous situations such as forgetting important appointments or getting lost while trying to find a new place. Despite this, DSC-MATE-4325's programming and commitment to law enforcement remain intact and he carries out his duties efficiently and effectively.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4325 was retrieved from a police department in ████████, where it had been in service for ██ years before its anomalous properties were discovered. DSC-MATE-4325 reportedly gained sentience and free will after an unknown glitch occurred in its programming. Its former colleagues and superiors are unaware of its anomalous nature.
