Item #: SCP-7000

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7000 has been placed under close watch and must remain within Site-██ at all times. The subject's behavior is highly unpredictable and must be monitored for any changes in their psychological state. No interaction with SCP-7000 should occur without the supervision of at least two trained security personnel.

Description: SCP-7000 is a human male identified as a fashion designer. However, the subject's highly eccentric appearance and behavior sets them apart from the norm. SCP-7000's face is covered in distinctive orange stripes with red clown eyes that denote an unknown manifestation of anomalous properties.

SCP-7000's favorite headgear is a hoodie, which serves as a remarkable disguise as well as a defense mechanism against theft and any hypothesized self-defense. It accessorizes itself with a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

Personality-wise, SCP-7000 is highly analytical and logical. This has contributed immensely to its eccentricity, as it often engages in bizarre conversations and arguments with any willing participant. The subject finds hilarity in trivial and insignificant matters and has been known to engage in heated debates over them.

Addendum 7000-01: After extensive observation, SCP-7000's orange stripes were found to be strictly for aesthetics.

Addendum 7000-02: Following its encounter with SCP-████, SCP-7000 exhibited signs of discomfort while donning the LED gas mask. The incident is still under investigation.
