Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7865 is to be monitored at all times for any unusual behavior or deviations from their established routine. Any significant changes in behavior are to be immediately reported to the Foundation. Under no circumstances is any information regarding the true nature of Subject 7865 to be revealed to him.

Description: Subject 7865 appears to be a typical human male in his mid-thirties with a charismatic personality. However, upon closer observation, several unusual physical features become apparent. The subject has orange stripes across his face, giving him an almost tiger-like appearance. His eyes are covered with what appears to be ski goggles, and he wears a police cap on his head. Subject 7865 also sports a jade earring and a gold chain.

Personality: While Subject 7865 may appear charming and ambitious, he possesses exceptional strategic thinking and organizational skills. He often takes on more than he can handle, but manages to get the work done through efficient planning and execution. However, despite his apparent success in his profession as a lawyer, his personal goals remain unknown.

Due to the nature of Subject 7865's appearance, the Foundation suspects that he may be a victim of some sort of supernatural affliction. Further investigation and research are required to determine the exact nature of his condition.

Addendum: Following a chance encounter, several Foundation personnel were able to observe Subject 7865's behavior outside of his job. It was found that he was involved in illegal activities, including drug trafficking and money laundering. It is unknown if his peculiar appearance has any connection to his criminal activities. The matter is currently under investigation.
