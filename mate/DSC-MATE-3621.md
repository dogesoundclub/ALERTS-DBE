Item #: 3621

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3621 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and is only permitted contact with Class D personnel in order to carry out its duties as a Theater Manager. Its access to social media platforms is to be restricted indefinitely. Any sudden emotional episodes or outbursts must be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: 3621 is a male humanoid of indeterminate age and origin, with a characteristic Mouth Spot on its otherwise ordinary-looking face. Its head is covered in layers of green hued skin, while the bulk of its outfit is a large gas mask, equipped with a series of LED lights. It has demonstrated no extraordinary physical abilities.

Personality: Subject 3621 is highly emotional, and seems to derive a great deal of pleasure from sentimental music, movies and art, even going so far as to be moved to tears by particularly poignant moments. This has led some on the research team to speculate that 3621 may have latent psychic abilities, although this has yet to be confirmed.

Addendum: Despite repeated attempts to restrict 3621's access to websites and social media platforms, the subject has occasionally managed to find its way onto these channels, where it has been observed to produce highly emotional and often disjointed posts. As a result, it seems clear that the best course of action is to restrict 3621's access entirely, and limit its interaction with the outside world to those carefully screened individuals required to carry out its duties.
