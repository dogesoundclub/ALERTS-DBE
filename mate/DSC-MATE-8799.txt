SCP-8799, also known as Officer Rabbithop, is a peculiar individual residing in the urban landscape. As a member of the police force, his appearance may cause initial confusion among those unfamiliar with his species. SCP-8799 has a rabbit-like appearance, with soft fur covering his entire body and long floppy ears serving as an extension of his sharp senses.

His eyes bear witness to his intellectual mind, often framed through his signature nerd glasses. Atop his head sits a doge hat adorned with various badges, indicating his years of service and hard-earned achievements. Navigating through the hustle and bustle of the city with ease, his jade earring bounces with each confident stride.

Although scattered in mind, SCP-8799's dedication to his job is unwavering. He is a skilled officer, handling even the most challenging of cases with great proficiency. His silver chain acts as a symbol of his duty, dangling down his uniform shirt as a reminder of the responsibility he holds.

The most noteworthy aspect of SCP-8799's personality is his propensity to get sidetracked easily, causing minor mishaps that often lead to laughter. Despite this, SCP-8799 remains a model officer, always returning to his duties with a sharp focus on the task at hand.

As such, SCP-8799's seemingly rabbit-like demeanor should not be taken lightly, for he is a force to be reckoned with in the face of danger.
