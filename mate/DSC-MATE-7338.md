Item #: 7338

Object Class: Anomalous Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7338 is to be monitored at all times when present in public areas. A team of two Foundation Agents are to be present no further than 20 meters from the subject. Any interaction with the subject must follow standard protocol 213-B-5. DSC-MATE-7338 is to be detained for study and testing in the Site-19 containment facility.

Description: DSC-MATE-7338 is a male human with a train driver's uniform. The subject possesses orange stripes on his face, with red clown eyes, a metallic purple head, jade earrings, and a red scarf as an accessory. DSC-MATE-7338's mouth is always covered with a medical mask. The subject displays no abnormal physical characteristics except for a fast moving tendency.

DSC-MATE-7338 displays a prominent personality trait of being fiercely independent, often refusing assistance even when required. This can lead the subject to engaging in comic scenarios, for instance attempting to move heavy objects on their own, or obstinately refusing help while lost without a map. Further, when speaking with DSC-MATE-7338, it has been observed it never communicates any further than typical small talk. 

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7338's anomalous abilities are currently unknown. However, given the subject's humanoid classification, the threat potential of the DSC must be assessed, monitored and documented to ensure the safety of all personnel who interact with it. Testing has been scheduled for further analysis.



Note: Head researcher Dr. ███████ has requested that any personnel attempting to engage in conversation with DSC-MATE-7338 are to be cautious and maintain recommended distances at all times due to the nature of the subject's abilities to currently remain unstudied.
