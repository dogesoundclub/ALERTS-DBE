Item #: 9294

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9294 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Their fashion design tools are to be removed at all times when entering or exiting the cell. Any clothing or accessory created by 9294 is to be screened for potential anomalous properties before authorized for use.

Description:  Subject 9294 is a female human with a unique appearance. They possess purple lips, spots on their face, and blue clown eyes. Their forehead is adorned with a two-color band that matches the choker accessory they always wear. 9294 has a strong sense of independence and is often seen as stubborn. They insist on doing things themselves, even when it may not be the most effective option. 

Despite their reluctance to ask for help, 9294 is a talented fashion designer. Their creations draw attention and admiration from all who see them. However, their creations have been associated with strange occurrences, leading to suspicion of possible anomalous properties. Under testing, 9294 has not shown any intentional use of anomalous abilities, but the possibility remains.

Interviews with 9294 have revealed that they have experienced strange events throughout their life, such as objects inexplicably moving or odd visions. These experiences have become normalized for them, leading to a potential resistance to recognizing or acknowledging any potential anomalous abilities.

Addendum: 9294 has created a new line of clothing designs that show a marked increase in anomalous activity. Testing is ongoing to determine the extent of these properties, and containment procedures may need to be adjusted. Plans for amnestic use and/or increased supervision are being considered.
