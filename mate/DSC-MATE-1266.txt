Item #: SCP-1266

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1266 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-17. Any contact with SCP-1266 is strictly prohibited outside of designated testing procedure. Personnel are advised not to stare directly into SCP-1266's eyes, as they are capable of inducing anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-1266 appears to be a monkey of currently unknown species, standing approximately 0.9 meters in height. They possess red clown eyes that emit a faint glow, even in complete darkness. SCP-1266's head is covered by a hooded sweatshirt, which appears to be their possession of choice. SCP-1266 is also known to carry a whistle, which they use for communication as well as for its perceived entertainment value.

SCP-1266 is a highly impulsive individual, often engaging in activities without any prior thought or consideration for potential consequences. They display a tendency towards risk-taking behavior, often seeking out exhilaration in their day-to-day life. Despite their propensity for danger, SCP-1266 remains friendly and personable towards all interactions.

SCP-1266 was discovered after reports of a small creature jumping off a cliff into a lake caught Foundation personnel's attention. Upon investigation, it was found that SCP-1266 had caused an SCP-████ event, which resulted in the temporary alteration of reality within a 10-meter radius.

Addendum: SCP-1266 has been allowed to indulge in their manic behavior within the safety of the Foundation. It is hypothesized that they may be a valuable asset in anomalous exploration where spontaneous decision-making is required. Further research into SCP-1266's anomalous effects is ongoing.
