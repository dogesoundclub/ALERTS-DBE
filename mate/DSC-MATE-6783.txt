Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6783 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be provided with appropriate food, water, and medical attention as needed. Access to SCP-6783 is to be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher, and all interactions with SCP-6783 must be supervised by at least one armed guard.

Description: SCP-6783 is a sapient, bipedal rabbit of approximately 1.2 meters in height. It appears to be a male and is commonly seen wearing a purple cap with a headset and horned rimmed glasses. It also has a gold earring in its right ear. SCP-6783 has displayed above-average intelligence and is capable of speech.

SCP-6783's personality can be described as analytical and logical, with a quirky sense of humor. It enjoys making witty observations and teasing its friends in a dry, deadpan way. Its mood varies, and it can become despondent and withdrawn if it feels isolated for an extended period. SCP-6783 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and has shown no signs of any anomalous abilities or intentions.

Addendum: SCP-6783 was discovered working as a security guard at a local mall when its unusual abilities brought it to the attention of the SCP Foundation. SCP-6783 has since been contained and poses no immediate threat to humanity. It remains under observation, and further testing will be conducted to determine its full capabilities.
