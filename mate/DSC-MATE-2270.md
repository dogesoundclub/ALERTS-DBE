Item #: 2270

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2270 is to be contained in a designated living space at Site-██. Personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-2270 are to refrain from making any sudden movements or loud noises, as they may cause the object to become frightened and agitated.

DSC-MATE-2270 should be provided with appropriate food, water, and clothing to maintain its well-being. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-2270 to engage in protesting, boycotting, or other forms of activism are to be immediately quashed by security.

Description: DSC-MATE-2270 is a male rabbit of undetermined age and origin. Its face is marked with a perpetually frightened expression, and its eyes are similar in appearance to ski goggles. DSC-MATE-2270 also wears a hooded sweatshirt, which it reportedly acquired during a protest against a clothing company with unethical labor practices.

DSC-MATE-2270 presents an abnormally strong desire to make the world a better place, which manifests through its penchant for protest and activism. Its goals and targets for activism are often nonsensical, however, and it will engage with any perceived injustice or slight, no matter how trivial.

DSC-MATE-2270 is sociable with human staff, but prone to nervousness and stress when receiving attention. Its behavior varies depending on its mood, and may range from happy and friendly to irritable and aggressive.

Addendum: In one incident, DSC-MATE-2270 managed to organize a sit-in protest in the break room, citing the quality of the coffee as an insufficient motivator for staff. Security teams were called in to remove it, and the coffee was replaced with a premium brand shortly thereafter.
