Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8821 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-8821 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher and must be authorized by at least two Level 4 staff members. DSC-MATE-8821's daily routine must include attending their job as a lawyer in order to maintain a sense of normalcy and to prevent suspicion from arising.

Description: DSC-MATE-8821 is a human female with spots on her face as well as red lips and orange eyebrows. Her head is not arranged in a typical hairstyle, but rather it remains unstyled and colored green. She can frequently be seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-8821 is described as very idealistic with a strong desire to make the world a better place. This can lead to some unpredictable behavior such as protesting or boycotting companies and causes that she feels go against her values. Due to her beliefs, she has made enemies with several influential groups and individuals.

DSC-MATE-8821's anomalous ability is the power to convince others to follow her ideals and become supporters of her causes. This influence is powerful, but has a limited range and can only sway individuals within 10 meters of her. This effect can only last for a maximum of 24 hours and is effective regardless of the listener's previous beliefs or affiliations.

DSC-MATE-8821's origins are unknown, but she claims that her abilities are a result of experimentation by a group of individuals who wanted to create "the perfect superhero". She managed to escape and hone her abilities on her own, becoming a successful lawyer in her civilian life.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8821 has expressed a willingness to assist the Foundation in exchange for protection from those who have become her enemies due to her beliefs. Further research into her past and the origins of her powers is ongoing.
