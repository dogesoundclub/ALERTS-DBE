SCP-8934 is a peculiar human-like entity that goes by the name of "The Politician". Despite its humanoid appearance, it displays unusual physical traits that render it quite aberrant. Its most striking feature is the pair of striking red clown eyes that seem to glow like embers in the darkness. These eyes are a result of a genetic mutation, and it is believed that they are a part of its adaptive camouflage mechanism. 

The Politician sports a bizarre combination of green hair and a purple cap that it wears on its head. Of note is the green cross earring that clings tightly to its ears, serving as an enigma for its identity. It also wears a medical mask over its lips, obscuring its visage and making it all the more elusive. But keeping its neck wrapped in a vibrant red scarf serves as a sharp contrast to its unusual attire. 

SCP-8934 shows a personality that defies typical patterns of its humanoid counterparts. It shows an unusual degree of empathy and understanding for others, to the point of exhibiting emotional outbursts when it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. Its close affinity with nature and animals further adds to its enigmatic nature. Its motivations for such and its larger scope of influence are still under investigation. 

If encountered in the wild, it is advised to maintain a safe distance and contact the Foundation immediately. Despite its unassuming presence, The Politician may have an ulterior motive that could pose significant danger to those who approach it. It is still advised to handle it with extreme caution.
