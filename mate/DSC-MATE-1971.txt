Item #: 1971

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1971 is to be monitored at all times, but is otherwise allowed to operate freely within his designated farmland. Subject is not to be approached without proper clearance from Foundation personnel. Any disturbances in the natural order of the farm caused by subject's abilities must be reported to Site Director immediately. 

Description: 

Subject 1971 is a human male identified as a farmer by profession. His most notable physical features are the spots on his face and his contagious smile. Subject's eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED implants, with unknown capabilities. The head of the subject is covered by a hoodie with no visible logo or text. He is commonly seen wearing a medical mask over his mouth, though the reasons for this preference are unknown. Additionally, he wears a gold chain as an accessory.

Subject 1971 is highly energetic and outgoing. Despite his responsibilities as a farmer, he has a great sense of humor that enables him to make those around him smile and laugh. He is also known to take his duties seriously, often putting others before himself, and has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This makes him an asset to the community he belongs to, with his ability to entertain and make others happy.

However, concerns have been raised regarding his abilities as they seem to affect the environment of his farm. The Foundation is investigating the cause of these effects and has not yet confirmed whether they are harmless or pose a threat. 

Additional Notes:

Subject's farming practices are highly efficient, often surpassing the anticipated yields. There are no known anomalies that contribute to this efficiency. 

Further observation is required to confirm if the VR Rainbow LED implants have any anomalous properties. 

Assessment: 

Subject 1971 is a friendly and likable individual whose personality might be the reason for his anomalous effects. He does not seem to possess any known abilities that compromise the safety of the Foundation or the general public. However, due to the anomalous effects on his farm and possible unknown properties of his implants, observation is recommended. Interaction with the subject should be limited for safety purposes.
