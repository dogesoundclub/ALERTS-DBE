Item #: SCP-7238

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7238 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell located in Site-██. It is required that SCP-7238 undergo routine medical checkups as per standard Foundation protocols. All interactions with SCP-7238 must be supervised by at least two security personnel.

Description: SCP-7238 is a male Bengal tiger, standing at approximately 2.2 meters. SCP-7238 appears to have two distinct humanoid traits: a stocky build and an opposable thumb on each paw. SCP-7238 is capable of verbal communication and expresses fluency in English. While fully capable of walking on all fours, SCP-7238 predominantly moves around on its hind legs. SCP-7238 has also been observed to display intelligence and cognitive functions consistent with a human being.

SCP-7238 is known to wear a medical mask over its mouth, covering a set of sharp fangs. It also wears a purple cap with green hair, and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-7238's eyes are its most notable feature, being blue in color with a prominent white ring around the iris, resembling clown makeup. SCP-7238's facial expression is typically that of a frightened mouth, although this trait does not appear to manifest itself in any consistent manner.

SCP-7238 is classified as Euclid due to its tendency to display risky behavior that may result in injury or harm to itself and others. SCP-7238 has an insatiable love for adventure and will attempt to explore uncharted territories or engage in high-risk activities.

Addendum 7238-1: SCP-7238 has been granted permission to work as a medical doctor within Foundation facilities. All relevant protocols regarding its interaction with Foundation personnel are to be followed. SCP-7238 has demonstrated exceptional diagnostic skills and has been a valuable asset to the Foundation's medical staff.

Addendum 7238-2: SCP-7238 was found to have a number of unusual physical traits, including heightened blood flow, enhanced muscle contraction, and resistance to certain types of toxins. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of these abilities and how they may be useful to the Foundation's research efforts.

Addendum 7238-3: SCP-7238 has expressed a desire to participate in Foundation field operations. This request has been denied due to SCP-7238's high-risk propensity for injury and harm to itself and others. Efforts are underway to provide alternative means for SCP-7238 to satisfy its sense of adventure without compromising safety protocols.
