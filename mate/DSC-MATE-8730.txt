Item #: 8730

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 8730 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to any computer or electronic device is strictly prohibited unless authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel. The subject is to be monitored at all times for any signs of aberrant behavior, particularly during and after electronic or computer usage.

Description:
Subject 8730 is a female human of average height and weight with green hair styled in an edge curl. The subject also possesses two distinctive facial features consisting of spots across her cheeks and a striking red lip. The most notable aspect of the subject's physical appearance is the vibrant jade-colored LED lenses that make up her eyes. These emit a bright green luminosity that varies in intensity depending on the subject's emotional state.

The subject has also been observed wearing gold earrings, a silver chain, and smoking a cigarette while in her cell. She identifies herself as a programmer but has not been cooperative with providing any further personal information.

The subject's personality is characterized by an impulsive nature and a tendency to engage in reckless and dangerous behavior. She possesses a disregard for authority and rules, frequently acting on a whim regardless of the potential consequences. It is suspected that the subject may have a form of addiction to technology and electronics, potentially explaining her erratic behavior when denied access.

Addendum:
Due to the nature of the subject's behavior, it has been determined that a mental health evaluation is necessary. Further testing is ongoing to determine the exact source of the subject's abnormal behavior and how best to contain it.
