Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-327 is to be contained in a humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its colorful appearance and natural charisma, DSC-MATE-327 should only be approached by personnel wearing clown masks and brightly-colored clothing. DSC-MATE-327 is to be provided with a pack of cigarettes daily and is allowed to smoke within the chamber.

Description: DSC-MATE-327 appears to be a human female in her late twenties, with orange stripes and a red lip on her face. The subject's eyes are blue and resemble those of a circus clown, and her head features a rainbow festival design. On the forehead, DSC-MATE-327 has a two-color band and a goggle, which the subject has stated helps her manage the theater.

DSC-MATE-327's accessories include a silver chain, which the subject wears at all times, and a cigarette, which the subject is frequently seen smoking. DSC-MATE-327 has a natural talent for leadership and often finds herself taking charge of situations. This ability has been observed in various situations, including work, social groups, and personal life.

DSC-MATE-327 is a Theater Manager, and those who have worked under her or have encountered DSC-MATE-327 have reported feeling a strong urge to comply with the subject's commands. This effect appears to be limited to verbal commands given by DSC-MATE-327, and the subject's charisma does not affect subjects' behavior if they are unable to hear her verbal commands.

DSC-MATE-327 has shown no signs of anomalous abilities or effects, but its strong leadership abilities make close monitoring necessary. Research is ongoing to determine if DSC-MATE-327's charismatic effect is due to an unknown ability.
