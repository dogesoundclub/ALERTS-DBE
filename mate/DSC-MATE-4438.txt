Item #: 4438

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4438 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-4438 is restricted to Level 3 personnel, who are required to wear noise-cancelling headphones while in the vicinity of SCP-4438 at all times. Any communication with SCP-4438 must be monitored and recorded.

Description: SCP-4438 is a male humanoid identified as a lawyer. SCP-4438 appears to be in his mid-30s and is of average height and build. SCP-4438 possesses two distinct facial features; a black spot located on the left corner of his mouth, and a perpetually frightened expression on his mouth. SCP-4438 is often seen wearing a doge hat, gold earring, red scarf and a candy stick.

SCP-4438 possesses a strong sense of intuition, which has been described as precognitive in nature. SCP-4438 can sense danger or distress before it happens and recognizes the emotions of others without them expressing it. Interviews conducted with SCP-4438 suggest that this ability manifests in a subconscious way, and SCP-4438 cannot control it.

The origin of SCP-4438's abilities is currently unknown. Any information on potential sources of SCP-4438’s powers should be reported immediately to Site-██.

Addendum: Since its containment, SCP-4438 has shown a reluctance to use its abilities, often stating that it is "better not to know". However, SCP-4438 has requested access to the Foundation's database to aid in its legal work. This request is currently under review.
