Item #: 8660

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is currently employed as a farmer in a remote location in order to minimize the likelihood of contact with the general public. 8660 has been equipped with a GPS tracker and is monitored at all times by Foundation personnel.

Description: 8660 appears to be a humanoid robot with green Cyclops eye and frightened mouth as primary facial features showing a constant expression of worry. The subject's eyes are obscured by horned rim glasses, the head is marked with a red alarm signal, and one ear wears a gold earring. 

The subject's mouth is covered by a medical mask which is necessary considering the unconventional source of power that the robot relies upon. Despite its technological features, it is noted by several researchers that the subject can inadvertently be comedic and enjoys entertaining others with jokes and stories.

Personality: Subject 8660 is highly sociable, and is prone to drawing attention in social situations. They have often been observed engaging with other individuals around them, humorously amusing them, and sharing stories about their past experiences. However, due to their continuous concern that they may, in some way, fall short of the expectations of the people they interact with, they seldom show genuine satisfaction with their social behavior.

While it is not clear how or why 8660's creators chose to include some features that can be interpreted as humorous, this certainly gives their robot a certain degree of charm.

Addendum: Testing has revealed that 8660 has significant potential for productive activities. This may include labor positions in rural areas, and roles in field support or construction. Further studies are required to assess the full extent of the functions and abilities of the subject.
