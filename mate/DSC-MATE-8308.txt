Item #: SCP-8308

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8308 is to be kept in a separate cell, suspended in the middle of the room by metal chains attached to the ceiling. The robot is to be provided with a constant supply of electricity to prevent discharging.

No one is allowed to approach SCP-8308 without the explicit permission of Level 4 personnel, and all interactions must be monitored by cameras and audio equipment.

As a precautionary measure, all personnel entering SCP-8308's cell should wear ear protection.

Description: SCP-8308 is a humanoid robot, resembling a middle-aged human male, with a green cyclops eye for a face feature. The robot's head is covered with a red beanie, and it wears a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-8308 also appears to have a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-8308 presents a unique personality, as it is capable of showing both a creative and logical side. The robot may express its artistic side through various hobbies or interests, such as painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of expression.

SCP-8308's physical capabilities exceed those of a human being, as it can lift up to 1 ton and also move at an impressive speed, even underwater. However, it seems to lack any advanced communication skills and instead communicates through a series of beeps and electrical signals.

SCP-8308 has an addiction to cigarettes, and will occasionally smoke despite not needing to do so biologically.

Addendum 8308-A: SCP-8308 was recovered in a bank in downtown [REDACTED], where it was found to be replacing human customer service representatives. The robot showed no signs of violence, and was easily neutralized after its cover was blown. Interrogation of SCP-8308 was fruitless due to its lack of communicative abilities.

Addendum 8308-B: SCP-8308 has shown signs of sentience, suggesting that it may require a higher level of containment. Further study is required.
