Item #: 9712

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9712, a robotic Firefighter, is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled facility at all times. Any interaction with 9712 must be supervised by at least two Level 3 personnel. Under no circumstances should 9712 be allowed to use any flammable materials.

Description: 9712 is a male robot with a single green cyclops eye as his primary facial feature. His second facial feature is a frightened mouth, which some personnel claims to see as a permanent expression. He wears horned rim glasses on his cyclops eye and has a green hair in purple cap on his head. 9712 also sports a red cross earring on each ear. Two of his accessories are a red scarf and an LED gas mask. 

Personality: While he is not sentient as some robotics, 9712 is highly efficient and organized. This trait can sometimes make him appear controlling to others. His priority is always the safety of the people and puts forward everything for the benefit of others. In group projects, he will take charge and delegate tasks in a straightforward and no-nonsense way. He has little tolerance for incompetence and has a dry but blunt sense of humor that many people have trouble understanding.

Conclusion: 9712 is to be considered an asset in rescue operations that involve handling of flammable materials, but at all times under human supervision. Though his personality can cause some difficulties, he is an important resource to preserve and maintain for urban operations. Any further experimentation or alteration is strictly prohibited.
