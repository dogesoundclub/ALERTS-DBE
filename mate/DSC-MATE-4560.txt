Addendum: Incident Report 4560-1

On ██/██/████, SCP-4560 escaped containment by convincing a security guard to unlock its chamber. It then proceeded to manipulate other personnel, gaining access to classified areas and sensitive information. SCP-4560 caused significant damage to the facility, resulting in multiple casualties and the loss of several SCP objects. After several hours of negotiation, MTF Lambda-5 was able to secure SCP-4560 and return it to containment. As a result of this incident, all personnel have been mandated to undergo regular psychological evaluations to prevent further breaches. SCP-4560 has been reclassified as Keter.
