SCP-6168 is not to be allowed access to any electrical equipment outside of specified work orders.

Description: SCP-6168 is a female human of average height and weight, with an unusual appearance. SCP-6168's face features orange stripes above the eyebrows, and it has orange eyebrows. SCP-6168's head is green with edge curl, and its ears are adorned with green cross earrings. SCP-6168 is always seen wearing a choker.

SCP-6168 displays no anomalous abilities outside of its proficiency as an electrician. However, interviews with SCP-6168's coworkers indicate that it can be impulsive and often acts on its emotions without thinking things through. This could lead to anomalous effects if SCP-6168 is not monitored closely.

SCP-6168's personality has led to several amusing situations, such as making spontaneous decisions that have surprised and amused others. Nonetheless, the Foundation must remain vigilant, to prevent SCP-6168 from unintentionally causing an unexpected and dangerous situation.
