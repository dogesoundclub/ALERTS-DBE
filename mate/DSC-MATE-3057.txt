Description: SCP-3057 is a human female with unique physical traits. Her face features spots located around the nose and eye area, with purple lips that contrast the rest of her skin tone. SCP-3057 often wears her hair in pig tails and is frequently seen wearing a choker and gold earrings.

SCP-3057 has exhibited a natural inclination toward leadership, developing an effortless way of taking charge during any situation. This trait is displayed when SCP-3057 took over her father's mafia organization after his assassination at a young age.
