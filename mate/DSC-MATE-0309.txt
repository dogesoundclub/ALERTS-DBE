Item #: 309

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The LED gas mask is to be kept in a separate locked container, and only authorized personnel are allowed to handle it.

Description: Subject 309 is a male human, about 6 feet tall with a mohawk hairstyle. Their face features are distinct, with a mouth spot and a clown mouth, giving them an eerie appearance. They have blue clown eyes and a two-color band on their forehead. The subject accessorizes their appearance with a green cross earring and a silver chain.

Subject 309 works as a banker, and their dry sense of humor can catch people off guard. They have a tendency to deliver deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny, regardless of not considering themselves the life of the party. Personnel interacting with 309 are advised to take caution as the subject can be unpredictable.

The most peculiar accessory to subject 309 is their LED gas mask. It is crucial that the mask is kept under strict control due to its unknown properties. Incident reports show that exposure to the mask can cause hallucinations and disorientation. Further research is needed to understand the mask's effect on subject 309 and its significance in the subject's overall anomalous state.

Addendum: Subject 309's anomalous properties remain unexplainable. Research to understand the mask's origin and how subject 309 obtained it is ongoing.
