Item #: 2010

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #2010 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment unit with appropriate furnishings and basic amenities provided. All standard security measures are to be taken including 7/24 surveillance cameras, multiple checkpoints on the way to the unit, and an exclusion zone established beyond 30 meters from the vicinity. Access to item #2010 may be granted only by Level 3 personnel with explicit written permission from Dr. █████.

Description: 

Item #2010 is a middle-aged man of the Homo sapiens species that seems to have a peculiar facial feature in the form of a spot on his mouth. His eyes resemble those found on skiing goggles, while his ears are adorned with a green jade earring. When not in use for testing purposes, item #2010 can often be found wearing a standard medical facemask and a silver chain around its neck. 

Despite an outwardly mundane appearance, item #2010 displays a notable tendency to emotionally connect with popular media, often experiencing strong feelings from various forms of art ranging from music to film. As a result, extended exposure to particular dramatic or sentimental pieces of media is strictly prohibited. 

Vehement warnings must be administered before exposing item #2010 to media content, as previous viewing experiences resulted in extreme emotional outbursts and excessive tears.

ADDENDUM: A recent incident involving an improperly vetted agent and a viewing of the film "The Notebook" resulted in a security breach and containment breach. A Level 1 lockdown was executed while Foundation agents contained item #2010 for assessment to confirm if any potential anomalous properties were triggered or if a simple breach, as it seems, occurred. Henceforth, access to item #2010 and its media engagement must be thoroughly reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, with a detailed psychological profile of the agent handling such engagement.
