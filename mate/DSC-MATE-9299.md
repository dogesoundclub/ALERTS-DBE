Description: DSC-MATE-9299 is a female human identified as a mechanic. Despite its strange physical appearance, DSC-MATE-9299's behavior is within the realm of normalcy for a human. Its head appears to be adorned with several colors of hair, possibly from a "Rainbow Festival" as its file suggests. DSC-MATE-9299 has been noted to be in possession of a gold chain and cigarette as additional accessories.

Of particular note is DSC-MATE-9299's unique eye color, which are a bright orange, and its defining facial feature - the smile on its lips. DSC-MATE-9299's duty as a mechanic creates an immense sense of responsibility within it, leading to excessive workloads and humorous situations when attempting to accomplish all of its tasks at once.

DSC-MATE-9299 is considered Safe at this time given its relatively harmless demeanor and ability to be contained with standard humanoid protocols.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9299 has requested several times to "fix up" its containment cell, insisting that it could improve the current security measures. These requests have been denied, but it has been noted that DSC-MATE-9299's desire to improve containment shows some level of cooperation with the Foundation.
