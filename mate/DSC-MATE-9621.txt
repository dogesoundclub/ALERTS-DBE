SCP Foundation Description:

Subject 9621, also known as "The Don," is a notorious mafia boss who has evaded law enforcement for years. Despite his human appearance, there is an air of danger and authority around him that suggests something more.

The Don's face is covered in spots, but it's his nerdy glasses that draw attention to his keen eyes - eyes that seem to see everything around him. His head is adorned with pink hair parted neatly down the middle, and his forehead bears a distinctive two-color band, perhaps a symbol of his status.

Glittering gold earrings hang from his ears, drawing the eye to his normal gas mask, an accessory he wears without explanation - but speculation often centers on the notion that it protects against toxic substances and biological attacks.

The Don's personality is both amusing and intimidating. His sense of duty and responsibility often lead him to take on more than he can handle, creating humorous situations as he tries to juggle multiple tasks at once. Yet, it's clear that he's not someone to be underestimated - the fear and respect among his associates is palpable.

Approach with caution.
