Item #: SCP-3089

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3089 is to be monitored closely and stored within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any attempts at communication with SCP-3089 must be authorized by at least two Level 2 personnel or higher. Additionally, due to SCP-3089's extensive connections within the criminal underworld, MTF Rho-11 ("Smooth Talkers") are to be on standby for any possible containment breaches.

Description: SCP-3089 is a Caucasian male of indeterminate age, standing at 5'11" and weighing approximately 190 lbs. SCP-3089 primarily wears a gray suit with an orange pinstripe pattern and a matching short peak cap. SCP-3089's most noteworthy feature is the orange stripes that run down the sides of its face, starting just below the eyes and terminating at the jawline. SCP-3089's eyes are of the ski goggle type, giving it greater protection against bright lights and other hazards.

SCP-3089's most prominent facial feature is the goggle it wears on its forehead, and it also wears a green cross earring on its left ear. When in public, SCP-3089 will wear a medical mask over its mouth, making it more difficult to identify. SCP-3089 is fluent in several languages, including ████, ████, and ████, and is well-versed in various criminal activities, particularly those related to organized crime.

SCP-3089 has a great sense of humor and has been known to tell humorous stories and do silly impressions in order to lighten the mood. Its personality is generally jovial and easygoing, despite its position as a respected Mafia boss. SCP-3089's extensive underworld connections make it a valuable asset in certain high-risk containment scenarios.

Addendum: Dr.█████ has recommended that further research be conducted into the potential anomalous nature of SCP-3089's orange stripes and ski goggle eyes, as well as the origin of its extensive criminal connections. Requests for such research are pending approval by O5 Command.
