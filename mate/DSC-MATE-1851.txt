Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1851 is to be allowed to continue their employment at the bank as a standard humanoid member of society.

Description: SCP-1851 is a human female, standing at 5'6" with a slender build. They possess distinctive spots on the face and exhibit a friendly smile. SCP-1851 possesses a pair of normal glasses, green cross earring-shaped ears, and is habitually observed to be wearing a gold chain.

SCP-1851's personality is characterized by a sense of strong duty and responsibility, leading them to take on an overload of tasks. They exhibit a sense of humor in dealing with situations that arise from this tendency, such as they try to carry too many things without dropping anything.

Further investigation reveals that SCP-1851's sense of duty and responsibility is part of their anomalous behavior. It is currently unknown how SCP-1851's behavior was affected, but tests are underway to identify the underlying cause(s) of SCP-1851's personality. Until then, SCP-1851 will be monitored regularly.
