Despite their recklessness, Item 6720 does not appear to have a malicious bone in their body. They often use their unique fashion sense and charming personality to bring joy to those around them. However, their unpredictable nature makes them a danger to themselves and others, and precautions must be taken to prevent any accidents or incidents from occurring.
