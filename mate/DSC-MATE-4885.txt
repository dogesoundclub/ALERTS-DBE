Designation: SCP-4885
Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4885 is to be contained in a reinforced maximum-security cell at Site-██. The cell is to be equipped with dampeners to cancel out their psychic abilities. SCP-4885 is not to be allowed contact with any other SCP, as they may use their abilities to discern information about the Foundation.

Description: SCP-4885 is a human female with distinct facial features including spots on their cheeks, bright red lips, and an orange streak on one side of their head. They also wear a silver chain around their neck and keep a cigarette in their hand. Their forehead is adorned with a pair of goggles and decorated with a two-color band.

SCP-4885 is known to be the leader of a powerful Mafia organization and uses their psychic abilities to remain one step ahead of their rivals. SCP-4885's powers manifest as an incredibly strong sense of intuition and the ability to predict future events. They also possess the ability to sense emotions, often using this to manipulate their targets.

SCP-4885's abilities can be highly unsettling, and their psychic powers may manifest in unpredictable ways. It is believed that SCP-4885's powers are innate, rather than the result of any anomalous mutation or enhancement.

SCP-4885 has clashed with the Foundation on several occasions, and it is believed that they have access to information that they should not possess. As such, containment and information suppression are top priorities concerning this SCP.
