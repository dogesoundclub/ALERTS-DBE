Item #: SCP-2526

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2526 is to be kept in a standard mammalian containment unit at Site-██. The containment unit must be fitted with a fire suppression system, as SCP-2526 has an affinity for candy sticks, which it may accidentally cause to ignite. Access to SCP-2526 is restricted to Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-2526 appears to be a male monkey of unknown origin, measuring approximately 1.2 meters tall when standing bipedally. SCP-2526's head is adorned with green hair and a purple cap, which obscures its eyes. On its forehead, SCP-2526 possesses two color bands, and a pair of goggles is also often worn. A single gold earring is present in each of SCP-2526's ears, and it is often seen with a red scarf around its neck.

SCP-2526 has demonstrated a high level of intelligence and communication skills with staff, utilizing verbal and nonverbal communication in conjunction with learned sign language. It has also been observed to exhibit spontaneous behavior, regularly embarking upon impromptu adventures or planning last-minute parties that have been successful.

SCP-2526 is employed by a local news station as a news anchor. It has demonstrated a high level of proficiency in this role, often reporting on unusual events and phenomena that are later found to be connected to other SCPs.

Addendum 1: SCP-2526 is known to have an affinity for candy sticks, often consuming them throughout the day. Staff are advised to ensure that SCP-2526 is provided with an adequate supply of candy sticks to prevent it from becoming agitated.

Addendum 2: On ██/██/20██, SCP-2526 was found to be the source of an anomalous broadcast that caused cognitive and physiological effects in viewers. The cause of this broadcast is still unknown, and further investigation is ongoing. SCP-2526's role in this event is not yet clear. 

Note: Further exploration into the connection between SCP-2526 and other SCPs is encouraged.
