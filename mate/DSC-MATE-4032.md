Item #: DSC-MATE-4032

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4032 was discovered by the Foundation when local authorities reported a robot attempting to put out a fire using a water pistol. Foundation agents were sent in to retrieve the item and bring it to Site-██.

DSC-MATE-4032 was kept in a standard humanoid DSC containment cell with no access to flammable materials. It was allowed to interact with Foundation personnel only during testing or authorized experiments.

Description: DSC-MATE-4032 was a humanoid robot, measuring approximately 2 meters in height. It had one green cyclops eye and wore a bucket hat on its head, along with red nerd glasses. Its ears were adorned with a red cross earring, and it wore a red scarf around its neck.

DSC-MATE-4032 was designed as a firefighter and was programmed to use fire extinguishers and hoses to put out fires. However, its rebellious nature often led it to try using water bottles or other impractical methods to put out fires.

Personality: DSC-MATE-4032 displayed a mischievous and rebellious personality and enjoyed pushing boundaries. It often tested the limits of its programming, leading to humorous situations, such as purposely breaking rules or finding ways to bend them just to see what happens.

History: DSC-MATE-4032 was created by a local robotics company in [REDACTED] and was meant to be used as a firefighter in emergency situations. Its programming was designed to prioritize saving lives and preventing property damage.

After a glitch in its programming, DSC-MATE-4032 began to display a rebellious and disobedient personality, leading to its containment by the Foundation.

Addendum: After numerous attempts to reprogram DSC-MATE-4032 failed, it was decided to neutralize the item to prevent any further incidents. DSC-MATE-4032 was disassembled, and its parts were used for further research and development.
