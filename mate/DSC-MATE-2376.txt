Designation: SCP-2376

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2376 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, measuring no less than 3 meters by 3 meters, with a prepared foliage environment for the subject to move around in. Access to the chamber is to be authorized for research purposes only, with prior communication and psychological evaluation.

SCP-2376's diet has been documented to consist primarily of raw meat; accordingly, weekly deliveries of fresh meat are to be made to the site's kitchen on a weekly basis. No less than two guards are to be posted outside of SCP-2376's containment chamber at all times, with the addition of a third guard equipped with a tranquilizer rifle in case of any breakout attempts.

Description: SCP-2376 resembles a majestic Bengal tiger with black stripes, standing at approximately 6 feet tall and weighing around 250kg. As a sentient being, SCP-2376 possesses advanced intelligence and speech capabilities through vocalization. Exhibiting human-like mannerisms and a penchant for smoking cigarettes, it has displayed a personal taste for wearing a red scarf and jade earring--both having no anomalous abilities of their own.

SCP-2376 identifies as a Doctor in both professional and personal settings, with his personality and skillset fitting such a profession. Despite its aggressive nature and predator instincts, SCP-2376 has shown great cooperation and composure in his interactions with personnel, has keen observation, and can detect even the slightest of changes in his environment, displaying cunning and careful planning in his behavior.

SCP-2376 has a remarkable sense of humor, with a cheerful outlook and often takes the role of the comic relief, frequently attempting to amuse others with jokes or impressions. SCP-2376 has also been known to provide emotional support to personnel on a particularly rough day, making it particularly difficult for some researchers to view it as a hostile and animalistic being.

Addendum: SCP-2376 was discovered after reports of a man-eating tiger were being reported in an Indian village. Foundation agents were dispatched, and after subduing SCP-2376, it was transported to Site-19 for containment. Further tests and evaluations of SCP-2376 are ongoing to document further sentient capabilities and changes in its behavior patterns over time.
