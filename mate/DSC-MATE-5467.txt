Item #: 5467

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject, identified as a male tiger, has been contained in a specially designed habitat within Theater XXXX in order to continue his job as the manager of that particular theater. A team of trained personnel has been tasked with the duty of feeding, providing medical aid and securing the area around the habitat. The chamber containing the subject must not be opened without prior approval from Dr. ███████.

Description: The subject, previously known as the theater manager of Theater XXXX, is a humanoid tiger with blue clown eyes. He has a permanent frightened mouth and wears a bucket hat with a red victory band around his forehead. The subject also possesses a gold chain and a whistle, which he has been known to use to reinforce his authority and to welcome new guests to the theater. The subject's behavior is generally considered to be friendly and non-threatening, though he has been known to act unpredictably in the past.

The subject has a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards his job as the theater manager, often working around the clock to ensure the smooth running of the theater. However, he also knows how to have fun, which sometimes results in humorous situations where he becomes the life of the party and entertains guests by leading sing-alongs and dances.

Addendum: During a recent incident, the subject escaped from its habitat and was found wandering around the perimeter of the theater. Foundation personnel were able to recapture the subject without incident, and it was later revealed that the subject had accidentally ingested a hallucinogenic substance that had been inadvertently introduced into its food. As a result, all staff members have now been instructed to be particularly vigilant when preparing and delivering the subject's meals.
