Item #: 8694

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8694 is to be kept in a secure, animal-friendly facility at all times. Due to his electrician background, the facility must be equipped with electrical outlets and good ventilation. Feeding must be done at a distance to avoid any harm done to personnel. Only authorized personnel are allowed to enter his containment chamber, and anyone entering the chamber must always wear electrical gloves and a hazmat suit. Any unauthorized contact with the subject must be reported immediately.

Description: Subject 8694 is a male tiger standing at 5 feet tall, weighing over 300 pounds. He has a permanent red beanie on his head and bejeweled gold earring on right ear. His eyes appear to be a VR Rainbow LED display, which reacts to his emotions. Additionally, he carries a candy stick, which he sucks on whenever he is idle.

Subject 8694 predominantly displays a caring and nurturing personality, often anthropomorphizing inanimate objects like talking to his plants or naming his car. Despite his nurturing personality, he demonstrates remarkable electrician skills, capable of repairing faulty electrical systems with precision and speed.

Subject 8694 has been instrumental in several electrical repairs in the facility, working round the clock to improve the infrastructure. His electrician skills and nurturing personality pose certain risks to the foundation, particularly during power outages, as his emotions can trigger unintended electrical surges.

Addendum: Due to a sudden emotional outbreak, Subject 8694 has exhibited increased aggression recently. His Rainbow LED eyes remain in a permanent red color, indicating a significant increase in stress levels, which could be detrimental to the facility's electrical infrastructure. Handlers are advised to approach with caution and to take necessary precautions.
