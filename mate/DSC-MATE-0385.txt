Item #: SCP-385

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-385 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-385 is allowed limited internet and television access, but must remain under constant surveillance for any potential anomalous activity. All interactions with SCP-385 must be approved by at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-385 appears to be a human male in his mid-twenties and works as a train driver for a local transportation company. However, SCP-385 displays anomalous features, including orange stripes on his face and a blue bandana on his head. SCP-385 also wears goggles on his forehead, nerd glasses, and a gold chain around his neck. SCP-385 is known to carry a candy stick in his pocket at all times.

SCP-385 displays a friendly and outgoing personality, often surprising his colleagues with impromptu adventures and spontaneous party planning. Despite this, SCP-385 is also highly organized and plans ahead, often presenting detailed itineraries and schedules to his coworkers for various activities.

SCP-385's anomalous properties have not yet been fully understood or documented. SCP-385 has not displayed any aggressive or violent behavior, and has cooperated with Foundation personnel in containment efforts. Further research is ongoing.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-385 reportedly disappeared from his containment cell. Foundation security footage revealed SCP-385 had accessed the facility's control room and deactivated all security systems. SCP-385 was later found in the cafeteria, having organized an impromptu party with several Foundation personnel. It is unclear how SCP-385 gained access to the control room or what other anomalous properties it may possess. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly.
