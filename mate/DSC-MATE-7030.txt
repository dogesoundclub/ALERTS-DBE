Item #: SCP-7030

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7030 is to be contained in a reinforced, soundproof containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be fitted with a remote-controlled door and a two-way communication system to prevent verbal exchanges between SCP-7030 and personnel. It is advised that subjects must not establish eye contact with SCP-7030 in any circumstance.

Description: SCP-7030 is a humanoid female of average build and height, with distinct orange stripes on her face. SCP-7030 is often seen with a cigarette in hand, and wearing a gold chain around their neck. SCP-7030's most striking feature is her orange eyebrows and green cross earrings. Despite her common appearance, SCP-7030 remains a notable threat due to her unique personality traits.

SCP-7030 is extremely protective of her loved ones, offering immense loyalty to a select few. Her temperament is that of a laid-back personality, which can be deceptively dangerous when provoked, where she becomes fiercely aggressive and confrontational. It is to be noted that SCP-7030 enjoys engaging in humorous situations that tend to involve heated arguments with anyone who insults their friends or family members.

Addendum: SCP-7030 was captured after extensive and coordinated efforts by the Foundation. SCP-7030 was identified as a notorious criminal who had caused considerable harm in the urban area. The subject had been on the run for several years before finally being contained. It is to be noted that many attempts to interrogate SCP-7030 have failed due to her unpredictable nature and disregard for authority.
