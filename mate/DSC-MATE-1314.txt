Item #: SCP-1314

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1314 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Due to its political position, SCP-1314 may not be restrained or sedated except in the case of an emergency.

Description: SCP-1314 is a male rabbit approximately 1.5 meters tall, dressed in a red retro cap and horned-rimmed glasses. It sports a jade earring and a gold chain necklace, as well as carrying a whistle at all times. SCP-1314 is capable of speech, and is fluent in several languages. Its voice is deep and authoritative, and it possesses excellent oratory skills.

SCP-1314 displays a strong talent for leadership and frequently takes control of situations, both professionally and personally. Its political position has allowed it to amass a large following of supporters, who follow its every move with rabid enthusiasm.

Despite its charming veneer, SCP-1314 has been known to be manipulative and ruthless in achieving its goals. It is capable of bending others to its will through its silver tongue and charismatic demeanor, often turning even its most ardent detractors into loyal followers.

SCP-1314 is known to possess several anomalous abilities, including a hypnotic gaze and an uncanny ability to predict future political events. Its powers seem to originate from its whistle, which, upon being blown, emits a high-pitched noise that has been known to overwhelm the senses of those within earshot.

Addendum: SCP-1314 was first discovered during the course of a routine political rally, when its oratory skills and charismatic stage presence caused several attendees to become agitated and potentially dangerous. Foundation agents were able to contain the situation, and SCP-1314 was brought into custody without incident. Further research is required to determine the extent of its anomalous abilities.
