SCP-6861, also known as "The Empathetic Rabbit", is a notorious villain in the urban fantasy world. As a rabbit, it is small and unassuming, but do not be fooled by its cute appearance. Its ability to sense the emotions of others is what sets it apart from its peers. SCP-6861 is equipped with a bucket hat that it wears at all times, complementing its quirky personality.

SCP-6861 is often observed carrying a candy stick, which it uses as a tool to manipulate the emotions of its victims. The candy stick is an anomalous object capable of inducing strong emotional responses in those who consume it. The rabbit uses this to its advantage, often luring individuals into a false sense of security by offering them the candy stick. Once consumed, SCP-6861 can then manipulate their emotions with ease, often leading them down a path of destruction.

Despite its villainous tendencies, SCP-6861 has a strong sense of empathy and is deeply attuned to the emotions of others. This is both a curse and a blessing for the rabbit, as it can lead to humorous situations where it knows just the right thing to say to make someone feel better or to help others see the humor in a difficult situation. However, SCP-6861's empathy also makes it acutely aware of its own actions and the harm it inflicts on others, leading to moments of introspection and guilt.

As with all SCPs, extreme caution must be exercised when dealing with SCP-6861. Its ability to manipulate emotions makes it a dangerous adversary and should not be underestimated. Approach with caution and do not let its cute appearance fool you.
