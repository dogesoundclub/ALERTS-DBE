Item #: SCP-786

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-786 is to be kept in a secure vault at all times, accessible only to Level 3 personnel or higher. Any interactions with SCP-786 must be recorded and monitored. In the event of any malfunction or deviation from its programmed behavior, SCP-786 is to be immediately shut down and sent to the containment laboratory for analysis.

Description: SCP-786 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin with a male appearance. Its head is adorned with a red beanie, and it wears a pair of goggles on its forehead. It also has jade earrings on its ears, and a gold chain and cigarette as accessories.

SCP-786's primary function is as a banker, although it appears to possess a personality beyond its programming. It has a love for adventure and enjoys taking risks or trying new things, often leading to humorous or dangerous situations. SCP-786 has survived near-death experiences while bungee jumping and has accidentally gotten lost in the wilderness, showcasing its tendency for reckless behavior.

SCP-786's internal components are highly advanced and sophisticated, with some researchers believing it to be of extraterrestrial origin. Its programming allows for free-will, although this has been shown to cause unpredictable behavior. SCP-786 has shown the ability to adapt and learn from its surroundings, leading to concerns about its potential to become a threat to society.

Addendum: SCP-786 has expressed a desire to explore the outside world and interact with humans. Although this request is denied due to safety concerns, monitoring of SCP-786's behavior is deemed vital for further research into its capabilities and potential for anomalous activity.
