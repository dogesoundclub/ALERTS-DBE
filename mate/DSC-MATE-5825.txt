Item #: SCP-5825

Description: SCP-5825 is a male robot of unknown origin, primarily used as an electrician. It has a single cyclopean green eye, and a frightened-looking mouth. The eyes resemble skiing goggles, while the ears have a unique red cross earring. It possesses a silver chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-5825 displays a somewhat scatterbrained and easily distracted personality at times. It may forget important appointments, get sidetracked during tasks, and even get lost while trying to navigate new locations. Despite this, SCP-5825 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, and typically complies with orders given.

SCP-5825 is capable of interfacing with most technological devices and can work at operational capacity with little to no supervision. However, due to its tendency to become distracted, personnel are advised to actively monitor its activities, to ensure they are performing as intended.

Overall, SCP-5825 poses little threat to the Foundation, but its unique abilities and personality quirks make it an interesting subject for further study.
