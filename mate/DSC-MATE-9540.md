DSC-MATE-9540's containment is crucial to prevent any further harm to the public, and any attempts to disseminate his designs must be immediately reported to the DogeSoundClub for confiscation.

Addendum: Psychological evaluations reveal that DSC-MATE-9540's anomalous properties may be a result of suffering from a severe form of synesthesia, coupled with powerfully empathic abilities.

Further research is deemed necessary to determine if DSC-MATE-9540 can control these abilities and if it is possible to create clothing designs that do not pose a danger to the public.
