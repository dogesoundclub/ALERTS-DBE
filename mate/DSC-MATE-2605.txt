Description:

SCP-2605 is a robotic train driver standing at 1.8 meters tall. The robot has a humanoid appearance, with the exception of an oversized green cyclops eye located in the center of its face. SCP-2605 is known for its eccentric fashion choices, including a Doge hat, red cross earring, and nerd glasses. Its most noticeable accessory is an LED gas mask, which emits a green glow.

SCP-2605's programming allows it to operate and control trains. Despite being artificial, it possesses a personality that occasionally exhibits reckless behavior. SCP-2605 may act impetuously, leading to minor mishaps or accidents. Its tendency to show off can cause these incidents to occur more frequently.

Addendum:

SCP-2605 has demonstrated an affinity for maintenance and upgrades. If requested, SCP-2605 can aid in modifying other robotic SCPs, with approval from authorized personnel. Please note that such requests may result in SCP-2605 exhibiting further reckless behavior.
