Description: Item #9364, formerly known as the Theater Manager, was a human male who possessed a unique trait of having a spot on their mouth that drew attention to it. They also had a bright, cheerful smile that many found disarming. However, it was their clown blue eyes that truly set them apart. Item #9364 had a habit of covering their mouth with a medical mask, which made communication challenging at times, and they were often seen wearing a hoodie, further adding to their enigmatic nature. They accessorized their outfits with a silver chain necklace.

Personality: As a Theater Manager dealing with numerous individuals, Item #9364 maintained a strong sense of independence and did not ask for help even when necessary, leading to both humorous and frustrating circumstances. They often tried to move heavy pieces of furniture alone instead of asking anyone for assistance, or refused to use maps when they were lost, resulting in wasted time and energy. Despite the practicality of teamwork, Item #9364 preferred to rely on their self-sufficiency.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9364 was an intriguing individual who, while neutralized now, will be remembered by the Foundation. Their strong desire for self-reliance and not asking for help brought an amusing and unique flair to their character.
