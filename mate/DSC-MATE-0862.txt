Item #: 862

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-862 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of behavior that may lead to disruption of public order or breach of secrecy. This is achieved by tracking her movements through her job as a delivery driver. Any contact with SCP-862 outside of her work must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-862 is a human female, identifiable by her orange striped, rainbow hair, red lips, and blue clown-like eyes. She is often seen smoking a cigarette, and her style is commonly described as "Rainbow Festival". Her behavior is generally non-threatening, but occasionally ocd and detail-oriented, often expressing itself through arranging, color-coding, and alphabetizing items in strange ways.

SCP-862's abilities are not yet fully understood, but through a series of tests, it has been discovered that she has a tendency to unintentionally disrupt the normality of the environment. This often results in the manifestation of strange occurrences in the areas she visits, such as odd weather patterns, electrical malfunctions, and even spontaneous hallucinations among the local populace.

It is still unclear whether SCP-862 is aware of her anomalous effect on the environment, and therefore the precise nature of her power is still under investigation. Any personnel interacting with SCP-862 are urged to maintain strict professionalism and avoid revealing any sensitive information.


Note: Further research is required to determine if SCP-862 poses a threat or simply an anomaly. More research is being conducted by Dr. [REDACTED]. 

ATTENTION: It is strongly recommended to monitor the impact of chaotic effects that could cause emotional or mental problems on other biological entities.
