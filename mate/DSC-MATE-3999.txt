Description: Subject 3999 is a male monkey of unknown origin, standing at approximately 4 feet tall when on all fours. The subject is capable of bipedal movement, but it is not its preferred method of locomotion. Subject 3999 displays physical characteristics that are both odd and inexplicable, such as a doge hat on its head and a jade earring in one ear. The subject’s most noticeable characteristic is its frightened mouth which is always agape, giving the impression of a perpetual state of fear. Subject 3999’s nerdy glasses give it an air of intelligence.

The subject possesses a sweet tooth, as evidenced by the candy stick it is often seen holding. It appears to provide the subject with a degree of comfort and calmness. Subject 3999 is a gifted mechanic with an innate understanding of how machines work.

Subject 3999 is a naturally empathetic and compassionate creature, often taking on the emotional burdens of those around it. This has resulted in the subject attempting to fix everyone and everything it encounters, leading to a level of exhaustion for the subject. Subject 3999 requires regular emotional support and reassurance to manage its empathetic tendencies.

Further research is ongoing to determine the origin and extent of the subject’s unusual attributes.

Addendum: Following containment breach and subsequent retrieval, testing revealed that Subject 3999’s candy stick can be used as a temporary sedative if necessary.
