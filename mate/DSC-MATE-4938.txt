This has led to her often taking on a workload that is greater than what she can handle, resulting in humorous situations. It is not uncommon to observe her struggling to carry too many items at once. Despite the comical situations that her commitment creates, her dedication to her work is unwavering.

Subject 4938 has been observed to possess an anomalous property in her persuasive abilities, which she employs to great effectiveness as a car salesman. Her influence can cause individuals to make decisions against their better judgement, resulting in unintended consequences. It is recommended that personnel refrain from direct interaction with her. The extent of her abilities is still being researched, and any new information must be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Addendum: Following Incident 4938-01, access to subject 4938 is to be strictly controlled. There is a need to limit exposure to her persuasive abilities, which have been demonstrated to have dangerous and long-lasting effects. Any employees who have been directly exposed to her must undergo psych evals and testing to assess the extent of any effects on their cognitive functions.
