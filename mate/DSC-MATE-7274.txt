Item #: 7274

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7274 (hereafter referred to as "Doctor Rabbit") is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment unit. Any interactions with Doctor Rabbit are to be conducted via remote communication unless specifically authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Doctor Rabbit appears to be a green-furred anthropomorphic rabbit with ski goggle-like eyes and a red scarf. The rabbit's head is noticeably disarranged and he wears a goggle on his forehead. Doctor Rabbit claims to have a sixth sense, often predicting future events or sensing the emotions of others, which make him appear uncanny to those around him.

Personality: Doctor Rabbit's intuition is his defining characteristic, and he often employs it to seek out cures and remedies for his patients. Despite his seemingly mystical abilities, Doctor Rabbit is incredibly matter-of-fact and rarely employs anything more than his own intuition when treating patients, often dismissing modern medical practices as unnecessary or overcomplicated.

Addendum: Doctor Rabbit is one of the most skilled doctors within the Foundation's network. His unique abilities and intuition make him a valuable asset in circumstances where traditional medical practices are insufficient. However, Doctor Rabbit's unpredictable nature and ability to sense nefarious intentions make him a liability in certain scenarios. Containment personnel are to exercise caution when interacting with Doctor Rabbit at all times.
