Description: 4680 is a male monkey, standing approximately 3 feet tall. Its most striking feature is its unusual eyes resembling ski goggles, giving it heightened visual acuity. It is always seen wearing a hoodie and an LED gas mask, which it wears to conceal its identity. 4680 tends to be very analytical and logical, and enjoys debating and arguing with others for fun. Its personality has shown to lead to some humorous situations, such as getting into a heated debate about a topic that others find trivial or unimportant. Despite its comical tendencies, 4680 is a known villain and has been linked to several criminal activities.

Addendum: Incident 4680-A

On ██/██/████, 4680 managed to escape containment by manipulating several guards into arguing with each other, causing them to become too distracted to notice its escape. The escaped 4680 was later apprehended and returned to its containment chamber without incident. As a result, all personnel are to be trained in conflict resolution to avoid any similar incidents.
