Item #: 1170

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1170 (codenamed "Carrot") is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The walls, floors, and ceilings of the cell should be made of reinforced steel and have no less than five layers of soundproofing. The cell must be equipped with a ventilation system that removes all traces of pollen, as the subject has been known to have an allergic reaction. The containment specialist must wear a hazmat suit and keep a minimum distance of five feet from the subject during any interaction.

Description: Subject 1170 appears to be a male rabbit who stands at approximately six feet tall when upright. The subject is usually seen wearing a bucket hat, horn-rimmed glasses, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask that covers his mouth and nose. The subject does not speak but can communicate through written language. The subject has an affection for dancing and often "lets loose" at social events, surprising observers with his impressive dance moves.

Personality: Subject 1170 has shown a remarkable sense of duty and responsibility towards his job as a car salesman. However, the subject also knows how to have fun and can be quite humorous when in a relaxed setting. When not working or dancing, the subject can be seen reading books or watching TV shows.

Addendum: Subject 1170 has exhibited some anomalous properties, such as the ability to regenerate lost limbs and regenerate from fatal injuries. However, due to the potential danger of the subject's abilities, all attempts to study or replicate these properties have been halted. The subject also appears to have a heightened sense of hearing and smell, which enables him to detect changes in the environment that others cannot. These properties make the subject invaluable for certain missions, but the risks associated with his abilities must be carefully weighed before deployment.
