Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3476 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. No special accommodations are required, but requests for access to animals or natural surroundings should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Personnel are to monitor for any outbursts or emotional distress, and may provide appropriate emotional support or counseling.

Description: DSC-MATE-3476 is a male human of average height and weight. His distinct facial features include orange stripes across his cheeks and a mouth permanently fixed in a frightened expression. His eyes have been replaced with ski goggles. DSC-MATE-3476 always wears a purple cap with a headset, and a single jade earring in his left ear. He is also frequently seen with a gold chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-3476 possesses a unique personality trait of deep empathy and understanding for others. He may become visibly upset or weep when exposed to others' pain or suffering. He has a notable affinity for animals and nature, and may request access to such environments.

DSC-MATE-3476's occupation before containment was as a real estate agent, and no anomalous abilities related to this profession have been observed. However, his emotional sensitivity and potential outbursts must be taken into account when interacting with him.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3476 was recovered after reports of a real estate agent causing chaos at a house showing due to extreme emotional reactions. Foundation agents were able to contain DSC-MATE-3476 without incident. Further investigation into the source of his anomalous traits is ongoing.
