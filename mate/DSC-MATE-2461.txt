Item #: 2461

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2461 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Communal areas for this subject are to be constantly under remote surveillance to monitor for any potential attempts to influence other subjects. Access to potential subjects for attempted influence must be strictly controlled by on-site Security.

Description: Subject 2461 is a male humanoid who works as a car salesman by profession. This subject has no known anomalous abilities or weaknesses; however, his physical appearance and personal characteristics may indicate an anomalous influence causing his behavior patterns.

Subject 2461's face has a unique feature of spotted skin and a perpetual smile. He displays an unnerving set of blue clown eyes, which give the impression of intense scrutiny. The subject has a green cross earring in his left ear, and a silver chain that he frequently wears around his neck. Additionally, a Doge hat rests on his head seemingly without the subject taking it off. 

Despite the subject's unknown origins, they present an undeniable magnetism and natural talent for leadership. This characteristic has been observed in various social situations, including their salesmanship, social interactions, and interpersonal relationships. Such an ability to influence makes subjects vulnerable to manipulation by SCPs with similar abilities or otherworldly entities.

Addendum: The subject's influence on individuals with sensitive dispositions is even more pronounced when paired with a regular routine of hypnosis techniques or subliminal messaging. Further investigation and testing on this susceptibility are currently ongoing.
