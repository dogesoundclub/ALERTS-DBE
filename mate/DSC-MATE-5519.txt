Description:

Subject 5519 is a male human who works as a fashion designer. The subject is easily identified by their distinctive orange stripes and red clown eyes, which are a result of an unknown genetic mutation. Despite their unusual appearance, the subject possesses a charming smile and a keen fashion sense that is admired by many.

Subject 5519 is always seen with a cigarette in hand, which they claim to help them focus and relax. They also wear a jade earring in their left earlobe, which is rumored to have mystical powers that aid in their creative process.

Underneath their flamboyant exterior, subject 5519 is driven by a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This often leads to them taking on more work than they can handle, resulting in comical scenarios where they try to carry too many things at once or cram their schedule with too many tasks.

While the subject's behavior may seem harmless, personnel are reminded that subject 5519 has a history of roleplaying that has resulted in unintended consequences. Anyone that comes in contact with the subject is required to have at least a Level 3 psychological evaluation before being allowed to interact further. 

Addendum:

Subject 5519 has shown an interest in collaborating with Foundation researchers on a fashion line specifically designed for anomalous individuals. While the request is still under review, personnel are advised to remain vigilant in their interactions with the subject.
