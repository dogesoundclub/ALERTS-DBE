Item #: 3004

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3004 is currently residing at Site-17 for long-term observation and analysis. Due to their seemingly ordinary appearance and occupation as an electrician, it is imperative that their presence not arouse suspicion from the general public. Access to SCP-3004 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-3004 is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on their face that resemble electrical circuits. Their mouth is often in a frightened expression, and they wear a medical mask which covers their nose and mouth. SCP-3004's eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology, which can project and display various images and colorful patterns. They also wear a police cap and a jade earring on one ear.

SCP-3004 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can sometimes lead them to take on more tasks than they can handle. This can result in humorous situations where they try to carry too many things at once or fail to fit all of their tasks into a single day. Despite this, SCP-3004 is dedicated to their job as an electrician and shows exceptional skills in electrical maintenance and repair.

SCP-3004 displays no signs of anomalous behavior or abilities; however, due to their unique appearance and occupation, it is recommended that they are monitored closely. Any changes in behavior or anomalies observed in SCP-3004 should be reported immediately to Site-17 security personnel.

Addendum: During a routine examination of SCP-3004, it was discovered that their medical mask was concealing an SCP Foundation-issued gas mask. Further investigation revealed that SCP-3004 had stolen the gas mask from Site-17's security ward during an electrical maintenance job. It is unclear why SCP-3004 would have needed a gas mask, and an investigation into their motives is ongoing.
