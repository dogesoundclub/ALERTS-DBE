Description: 

Item #3960, also known as the Theater Manager, was a female human who held the position of managing a theater before her discovery. The subject's appearance was distinctive, sporting spots across her face and complemented with red lipstick which highlighted two bright blue clown eyes. The subject also donned a tiara on her head, a symbolic accessory of her former profession, and is rarely ever seen without a cigarette between her lips. 

The subject displayed a highly detail-oriented personality, often obsessing over neatness and order which translated to her personal life. She organized her belongings meticulously, opting to alphabetize her spice rack and color-coding her closets. This trait made her an excellent theater manager but also led her to display irrational behavior when out of her element.

It is worth noting that Item #3960's appearance seemed to be caused by an anomalous effect of the theater she managed, suggesting a tie between the individual and the theater itself, though no further explanation was discovered.

Addendum: Item #3960 has since ceased to exist, and any attempts to recreate the circumstances resulting in the item's creation have been met with failure. It is now considered Neutralized.
