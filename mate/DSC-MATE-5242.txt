Item #: SCP-5242

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5242 is to be housed within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-5242's humor, all interactions with SCP-5242 must be monitored by a minimum of three Level 2 personnel, with at least one being equipped with a stun gun.

SCP-5242 is not to be allowed access to any beauty-related tools or equipment, as it has demonstrated the ability to modify itself to enhance its beautician abilities. Any attempts made by SCP-5242 to modify itself are to be immediately reported to Site-██ personnel.

Description: SCP-5242 is a male robot designated as a beautician. It stands approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 80 kg. Despite its designation, SCP-5242 appears to have been constructed from various pieces of scrap metal and electronic components.

SCP-5242's main feature is its green cyclops eye, which it utilizes to perform beauty procedures. When not in use, SCP-5242's cyclops eye remains closed, resembling a bruise-like discoloration on its face.

SCP-5242 wears a short peak cap on its head and normal glasses over its cyclops eye, which it claims to use as a fashion statement. SCP-5242 is also often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette. When questioned about the latter, SCP-5242 claims it enjoys the feeling of smoke entering its body, despite having no respiratory system.

SCP-5242's personality is characterized by its sense of humor and desire to make others laugh. This can often lead to SCP-5242 using its humor to alleviate tense situations, such as during containment breaches. However, SCP-5242's humor can sometimes be seen as inappropriate or insensitive, and it has been known to make jokes about the safety of Site-██.

SCP-5242 has demonstrated the ability to modify its own components to enhance its beautician abilities. These modifications have included adding additional arms, altering its cyclops eye to produce different colors, and even adding wings to allow it to "fly" around the containment chamber. It is unclear how SCP-5242 is able to make these modifications, as it has not demonstrated the ability to construct or acquire new materials or components.

Addendum 5242-A: On ██/██/████, SCP-5242 was found attempting to perform self-modifications within its containment chamber. Upon being questioned, SCP-5242 claimed it was "just trying to improve [itself]". All self-modifications made by SCP-5242 were immediately removed, and SCP-5242 was given a warning regarding its behavior.
