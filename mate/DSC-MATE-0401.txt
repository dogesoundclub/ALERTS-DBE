Item #: SCP-401

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-401 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-401 is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel and above. SCP-401 is to be provided with cigarettes on a bi-weekly basis as a reward for good behavior. Any attempts by SCP-401 to exceed his duties as Theater Manager are to be immediately reported to site command for review.

Description: SCP-401 is a human male of average physical build, standing at approximately 5'11" in height. SCP-401's most defining physical feature is a pattern of spots that adorn his left cheek and eyebrow. SCP-401's hair is dyed green and regularly styled in a purple cap. He is often seen wearing a red victory band on his forehead and a jade earring on his right ear.

SCP-401 is a skilled actor, having previously held the position of Theater Manager at various venues throughout the country. SCP-401 is friendly and cooperative when approached, but has demonstrated a strong sense of duty and responsibility that can sometimes lead to over-commitment. This is believed to be a result of SCP-401's need for validation and recognition from his peers.

Addendum: During a routine inspection of SCP-401's containment chamber, it was discovered that SCP-401 had been using his cigarettes as a means of currency in trades with other SCPs. SCP-401 has been reprimanded for this behavior and his cigarette allowance has been reduced until further notice.
