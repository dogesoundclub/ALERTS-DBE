Subject 4542 is a unique case even among our collection of supernatural beings. Appearing in his natural form as a towering tiger, one might expect him to be intimidating and aggressive. However, his frightened mouth and normal glasses lend a sense of vulnerability to his appearance that contradicts these expectations.

As a theater manager, 4542's charisma and emotional intelligence are put to good use. He has a remarkable ability to connect with others, drawing people in and forming deep connections. This talent often results in lighthearted moments, making it easy for him to coax stories from even the most guarded individuals or sharing humorous anecdotes that endear him to his audience.

Despite his striking appearance, 4542's approachable demeanor and penchant for making others feel at ease make him a valuable asset both in the workplace and in the containment facility. However, given his species, we must exercise caution when handling 4542 as he retains the physical capabilities of a fully-grown tiger.
