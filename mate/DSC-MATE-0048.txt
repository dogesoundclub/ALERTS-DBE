SCP-48, also known as "The Tiger News Anchor," is a male member of the feline species who has taken on the guise of a human male in order to fulfill his purpose as a news anchor. His frightened mouth often makes it appear as though he is on the verge of screaming, though he never actually does. His eyes take the form of ski goggles, which he keeps on even when not skiing, as though he is always ready for danger.

SCP-48's green head is not arranged in any particular way, often appearing messy and unkempt. However, this does not detract from his overall professionalism and ability to captivate his audience. He wears a single gold earring in one of his tiger ears, a nod to his animalistic heritage.

Despite his intimidating appearance, SCP-48 has a playful side. He possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but he also knows how to let loose and have fun. This can lead to humorous situations, such as surprising others with his dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor at social events.

SCP-48 understands that his unique appearance and abilities make him a valuable asset to the Foundation, and he takes his job seriously. However, he also knows that life should be enjoyed, and he embraces this philosophy whenever possible.
