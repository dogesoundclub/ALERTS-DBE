Item #: SCP-8205

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8205 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. Any unusual behavior or activity is to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-8205 is a human male of unknown age. SCP-8205 works as a train driver, and possesses a keen analytical mind. SCP-8205's face is marked with spots, and it often sports a gold earring in its right ear. SCP-8205's most distinctive feature is its red clown eyes, which it seems to have acquired during a previous anomalous encounter.

SCP-8205 typically wears a short peak cap, with a normal gas mask as an accessory. The reason for this is unknown, but it is hypothesized that SCP-8205 may experience some health problems due to the nature of its work.

Despite its serious and often stoic demeanor, SCP-8205 has a quirky sense of humor. It enjoys making witty observations and teasing its friends in a deadpan way. This behavior appears to be a form of coping mechanism, given the intense and dangerous nature of its work.

SCP-8205 remains a mystery to the Foundation, as its origins and abilities are still unknown. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of SCP-8205's anomalous properties.
