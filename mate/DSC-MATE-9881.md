Item #: 9881

Object Class: Standard

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9881 is to be monitored by undercover agents at all times while on duty as a fast food worker. Any unusual behavior is to be reported to Foundation personnel immediately.

Description: Subject 9881 is a male human in his mid-twenties. His most notable physical feature is a dark spot on his mouth. He has augmented his eyes with VR Jade LED technology and wears a police cap on his head. He also sports a green cross earring and a bright red scarf.

Subject 9881 possesses a dry sense of humor that can catch those around him off guard. He may not have the typical outgoing personality that defines the life of the party, but he has a knack for delivering deadpan jokes that are surprisingly funny. While this trait may not seem significant, it could potentially serve as a way to distract or deflect during potential breaches.

Due to his employment at a fast food restaurant, there is a higher likelihood of interaction with the general public. It is imperative that Foundation personnel remain vigilant to prevent any potential exposure to anomalous activity.
