Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7297 is to be placed under standard humanoid containment conditions. Any medical assistance needed is to be administered by a qualified medical professional.

Description: Subject 7297, also known as "Dr. Smiles," is a male human of average height and build. The subject's face is marked with numerous spots, which have been identified as freckles. Dr. Smiles wears normal glasses and his forehead is marked by a distinctive two-color band. The subject can often be seen wearing a jade earring and a silver chain around his neck. Additionally, Dr. Smiles is rarely seen without a cigarette.

Dr. Smiles is a medical doctor and is known for his strong sense of empathy for his patients. He is able to quickly and easily understand the emotions of those around him and adapt his behavior to put people at ease. Despite his friendly demeanor, Dr. Smiles is not afraid to be blunt when necessary.

Dr. Smiles' empathy can often get him into trouble, as he has been known to take on the emotional burden of his patients. This has led to instances of burnout and exhaustion, and steps have been taken to ensure that he receives appropriate support and counseling.

Addendum: Dr. Smiles has been a valuable asset to our organization, providing medical expertise and emotional support to our other humanoid DSCs. His kind demeanor and ability to connect with others make him a valuable asset to the containment team.
