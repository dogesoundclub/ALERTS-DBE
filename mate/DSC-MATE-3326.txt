SCP-3326 is not allowed access to any items that could be used as a weapon, such as sharp tools or wires.

Description:

SCP-3326 is a male rabbit of an unknown species with blue clown eyes. SCP-3326 is approximately 40 cm in length and weighs around 1kg. SCP-3326 is capable of limited speech, with a high pitched voice that is difficult to understand.

SCP-3326 wears a red victory band on his forehead, and a gold earring on his left ear. He is often seen wearing a bucket hat and a silver chain around his neck, which he uses as an accessory.

SCP-3326 exhibits a tendency to act before thinking, which can lead to accidents or mishaps. He also enjoys showing off and gaining attention, which can cause SCP-3326 to make reckless decisions. SCP-3326 is overall a friendly and outgoing individual with a knack for fixing electrical devices.

SCP-3326 was first discovered after a series of electrical disruptions at a local power plant. During routine maintenance, SCP-3326 was found in the inner workings of a generator, conducting electrical repairs. SCP-3326 was brought into Foundation custody shortly after.

Addendum:

SCP-3326 is often requested for maintenance work due to his skill and efficiency. However, it is imperative that SCP-3326's reckless tendencies are monitored and controlled to avoid any potential accidents. SCP-3326 shows no signs of hostility or aggression towards humans, but it is advised to approach with caution in case of unexpected behavior.
