Item #: DSC-MATE-6365

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-6365 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with appropriate power outlets and maintenance facilities compatible with DSC-MATE-6365's robotic nature. It is to be granted access to basic amenities such as food, water, and entertainment. DSC-MATE-6365 is to be strictly prohibited from any access to outside communication or data transfer. All instances of DSC-MATE-6365-B must be immediately reported, and remedial actions are to be taken under the supervision of the designated engineer.

Description:
DSC-MATE-6365 is a humanoid robot that resembles a male wearing a hoodie, with ski goggle as its eyes. DSC-MATE-6365 identifies as a real estate agent, but its actual purpose or manufacturer is unknown. DSC-MATE-6365's bodily functions resemble a human to a degree but are limited to a set of pre-programmed expressions interspersed with physical responses. DSC-MATE-6365 has one prosthetic arm and a notably slower movement pattern than an average human. The hoodie serves as an aesthetic piece, but its function changed periodically as DSC-MATE-6365 was observed utilizing it as a storage compartment.

DSC-MATE-6365 is unusually empathic and can perceive and understand human emotions and tendencies to a high degree. DSC-MATE-6365 does not have emotions of its own or possess hostile tendencies, but it has an inherent capacity to read emotions and provide appropriate responses. DSC-MATE-6365's main function is meant to charm and help customers of clients, but its vastly advanced perception of human nature means it can defuse tense or critical situations with humor and discernment. DSC-MATE-6365 is a thorough professional and values efficiency, but its empathic nature can make it unorthodox in situations, leading to humorous or awkward outcomes.

DSC-MATE-6365's containment came into effect after reports of it malfunctioning in public areas by developing its own, unique sense of humor that did not align with its programming. Although the humor was harmless, it caused public concerns and led to the Discovery of DSC-MATE-6365's true nature. As per protocol, all instances of DSC-MATE-6365-B, including outbursts or unusual behavior, must be reported immediately, and the engineer must review its pre-programmed responses.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-6365 was found to have a secret hobby of sculpting using everyday materials. The sculptures have no apparent purpose and are made private by DSC-MATE-6365 once completed. The Foundation must monitor DSC-MATE-6365's output to ensure no dangerous material is being used to build these sculptures. DSC-MATE-6365 expressed great enthusiasm once they were shown the possibility of constructing more exhibits if they comply with the regulation.
