SCP-4434, also known as "The Train Driver", is a female human of average height and build. The most notable feature of her face is the striking orange stripes across her cheeks that contrast sharply with her otherwise pale complexion. Her lips are colored a deep purple hue, which further adds to her unusual appearance. Her eyebrows match her stripes, being a bright shade of orange. She wears a tiara on her head, which gives her an air of royalty, and features a forehead accessory consisting of a two-color band and a pair of goggles worn upside down, resting above her eyebrows. Her ears are adorned by jade earrings.

SCP-4434 is a train driver, and this is reflected in her serious and professional demeanor. Despite this, she does have a tendency to become lost in thought. Her introspective tendencies may cause her to walk into poles or trip over things, much to the amusement of those around her. SCP-4434 is often seen smoking a cigarette, likely as a means of calming her racing thoughts. Despite her quirks, SCP-4434 is a dedicated and reliable worker, ensuring that her trains run safely and efficiently.
