Item #: SCP-4937

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4937 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to its ability to intimidate and seduce personnel, it is to be kept under constant surveillance via CCTV cameras and audio monitoring devices. Any attempts at compromising containment are to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-4937 is a male tiger of average height and weight. Its most notable feature is its face, specifically its frightened mouth and its eyes, which consist of VR Rainbow LED technology. Additionally, SCP-4937 wears a purple cap with a headset, gold earrings, and a medical mask. It also wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-4937's initial demeanor is that of a charismatic and charming car salesman. Its natural charm and charisma are capable of manipulating individuals it interacts with, making them the life of the party. SCP-4937's sense of humor is also noteworthy, and it enjoys telling jokes and performing silly dances to make others laugh.

However, SCP-4937 has been known to display threatening and violent behavior when contained. It has been observed to use its intimidation tactics to assert dominance over other entities and has shown a willingness to use violence to achieve its goals. This behavior is believed to be connected to its tiger species identity.

SCP-4937 was initially recovered by the Foundation due to reports of a tiger in a car dealership in [REDACTED]. After prolonged negotiations, SCP-4937 was convinced to surrender itself to the Foundation's authority.

Addendum: Further testing and observation have revealed that SCP-4937 possesses the ability to emit pheromones that can affect human behavior. Personnel interacting with SCP-4937 have reported feeling more trusting and cooperative than usual, leading researchers to hypothesize that SCP-4937's abilities may extend beyond simple charm and manipulation. Testing is ongoing.
