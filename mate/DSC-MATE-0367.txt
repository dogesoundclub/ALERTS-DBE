Description: Identification number 367, also known as "The Villain", is a human female with distinct face markings resembling large spots. Her most noticeable feature is her constant, unnerving smile. She wears normal glasses on her eyes, and a red cross earring on her left ear.

Identification number 367 is known to possess a variety of dangerous abilities, including enhanced strength and agility, and a high level of intelligence.

While the exact nature of her powers remains unknown, it is believed that the Villain has found a way to control her emotions to an extent that allows her to harness them for her own purposes. She is considered to be a threat due to her unpredictable nature and ability to cause widespread destruction when provoked.
