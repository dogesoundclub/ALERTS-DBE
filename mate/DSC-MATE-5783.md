Item #: 5783

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5783 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit with reinforced walls to prevent escape. Feeding is to be done with a variety of fruits and nuts, as DSC-MATE-5783 has displayed signs of being predominantly herbivorous. In addition, all Foundation personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-5783 must wear personal protective equipment to shield against potential contamination from DSC-MATE-5783's respiratory system.

Description: DSC-MATE-5783 is a male monkey of an as-yet unknown species, displaying curious physical characteristics that have yet to be observed in any known primate species. DSC-MATE-5783 is frequently observed wearing gold chains and horned-rim glasses, along with a hoodie and a gas mask. DSC-MATE-5783 works as a news anchor on a local broadcast station, displaying an uncanny ability to communicate with both humans and other primates.

DSC-MATE-5783 has shown a penchant for risk-taking and impulsive behavior, frequently engaging in reckless stunts such as cliff jumping or river rafting. Anecdotal evidence suggests that DSC-MATE-5783 may be capable of communicating telepathically, although further testing is required to confirm this suspicion.

Addendum: During a routine check on DSC-MATE-5783's containment unit, Foundation personnel discovered a note in the monkey's possession. The note was inscribed with the following: "I'll never forget the day I discovered my powers. Somehow, I just knew that I was different from the other monkeys, and I knew that I had to use my abilities to help others. I've been trying to do that ever since, working as a news anchor to spread the word about important issues and taking risks when necessary to get the story. If there are others out there like me, I hope they can find their own way to use their abilities for good." Further investigation is ongoing.
