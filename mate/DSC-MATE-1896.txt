Item #: SCP-1896

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1896 is to be monitored at all times through security cameras placed within her workplace. Any abnormal behavior or activity is to be reported to the monitoring agent immediately. SCP-1896 is only permitted to conduct business during normal working hours and is to be contained within her workplace during all other times.

Description: SCP-1896 is a female human identified by the presence of purple lips, red clown eyes, and 00s schoolgirl attire. The entity's most prominent feature is her red cross earring which has been shown to emit a low-frequency hum when SCP-1896 experiences heightened emotional states. SCP-1896 is believed to be a reality bender and has been classified as Euclid due to the unpredictable nature of her abilities.

SCP-1896's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and stubbornness. The entity has been known to refuse assistance and rely solely on her own abilities even when faced with overwhelming odds. Furthermore, SCP-1896's knowledge of the inner workings of the real estate industry has made her valuable to several Groups of Interest that focus on financial gain.

Addendum: SCP-1896 has been observed to possess the ability to manipulate objects through unknown means. Documents recovered from the entity's work desk have shown photographs of furniture moving on its own accord, suggesting that SCP-1896 has telekinetic abilities. SCP-1896 has also been known to smoke cigarettes and wear a gold chain around her neck, which may be related to her anomalous properties. This requires further investigation.
