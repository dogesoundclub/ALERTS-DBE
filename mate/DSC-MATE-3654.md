Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3654 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3654 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, with all communication monitored and recorded.

DSC-MATE-3654 is to be kept under constant surveillance due to its potential to cause emotional and psychological disturbances to those who come into contact with it.

Description: DSC-MATE-3654 appears to be a human male in his mid-30s with several distinctive features. He has numerous large spots covering his face, seemingly random in pattern and placement. DSC-MATE-3654's eyes emit a constant green light, likely the result of cybernetic implants. His head is almost always covered by a dark hooded sweatshirt, and he wears a medical mask over his mouth.

DSC-MATE-3654 presents a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality, often becoming excited about things others may find mundane or insignificant. This can lead to DSC-MATE-3654 inadvertently causing humorous situations and disturbances when interacting with other personnel.

DSC-MATE-3654 works as a train driver and has been known to display an almost obsessive interest in locomotives and railways. Staff members have reported DSC-MATE-3654 frequently humming train-related themes and discussing train models and routes.
