SCP Identification Number: 1954

Subject 1954 is a male human identified as a banker in the urban city. The facial features of this subject are distinguished by orange stripes that run across his entire face, complemented with a warm smile that has an uncanny ability to put anyone at ease. The subject's eyes are hidden behind a pair of normal glasses that provide him with a studious appearance.

The head of this subject is the most peculiar of all his features. It's parted pink hair, which is set in a clean and organized style, indicating that subject 1954 is highly regimented and values order in his life. With these features, one might consider him a strictly conservative banker, but there's something more to him—a curious and unusual personality that's difficult to dismiss.

Subject 1954 is a nurturing individual, and this quality extends beyond people— it stretches to inanimate objects as well. He gives his car a name, talks to his plants, and even anthropomorphizes his household appliances. This behavior has been observed in similar entities, such as those classified under the Anomalous Metaphysical category or those affected by mind-bending, eldritch entities.

Further study into the personality of subject 1954 is warranted as psychologists at the Foundation believe that it could open a new avenue of research into the psychology of anomalous individuals. Further, the subject is not to be allowed to interact with other anomalous beings without proper security protocols, as his nurturing personality might provide succour to anomalous entities that can lead to their catastrophic spread in the urban area.
