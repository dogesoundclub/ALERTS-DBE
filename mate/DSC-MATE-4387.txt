SCP-4387, codenamed "The Blue Farmer", is a female human with distinctive blue metal covering her head, giving her the appearance of a cyborg. Her face is marked by a number of spots, adding to her unusual appearance. SCP-4387 is often seen wearing a gold chain which she seems to hold a great affinity for.

The most striking feature of SCP-4387 is her piercing, bright blue clown-like eyes which have been observed to shift in hue depending on her emotional state. The Blue Farmer's mental and emotional state is often marked by extreme highs and lows. While in a good mood, SCP-4387 can be very creative and has a vivid imagination. Her unusual hobbies and interests have been noted, including writing poetry, creating elaborate costumes, and collecting unusual objects such as antique keys, clock parts, and gears.

While SCP-4387's creative tendencies can be beneficial, they can also be a cause for concern. SCP-4387 has been observed to display signs of emotional instability and is prone to mood swings. These emotional swings can result in violent outbursts, leading to damage of her surroundings and harm to others.

Overall, SCP-4387 is considered to be a low-level threat to containment, but caution must be taken when interacting with her. While her creative talents can be harnessed for the betterment of the foundation, her emotional instability should not be overlooked. SCP-4387 should be monitored closely and provided with appropriate outlets for her creative tendencies to reduce the likelihood of negative consequences.
