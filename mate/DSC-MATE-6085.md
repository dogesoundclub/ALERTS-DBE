Item #: 6085

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6085 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a climbing apparatus and adequate lighting. They are to be provided with a steady supply of fresh fruit to ensure their physical health. DSC-MATE-6085 is not to be granted access to any kind of gift-giving material or merchandise, and all incoming or outgoing mail must be carefully screened for potential threats.

Description: DSC-MATE-6085 appears to be a male Capuchin monkey, dressed in an old-fashioned, retro cap and shade glasses. They exhibit a frightened expression, with their mouth widely open. This facial feature may suggest a sign of distress or anxiety. DSC-MATE-6085's ears are adorned with a single gold earring, and they are frequently seen wearing a red scarf around their neck. They carry a whistle as a tool and a means of communication.

DSC-MATE-6085 has displayed an abnormally high level of attentiveness, observation, and attention to detail, which may indicate a form of intelligence beyond the basic characteristics of a common primate. DSC-MATE-6085 exhibits excellent gift-giving skills but may brood over selecting the perfect gift for an extended period before making a well-informed and calculated decision.

DSC-MATE-6085's gift-giving abilities cause them significant distress, which may manifest in the form of anxiety attacks, irritability, and self-doubt, limiting their ability to function effectively in a social environment. DSC-MATE-6085 is, therefore, to be closely monitored by Foundation personnel while interacting with outside individuals and provide necessary support, including therapy sessions and medication, when required.

Addendum: Following an incident in which DSC-MATE-6085 was observed attempting to escape containment to purchase a gift for a fellow D-class personnel, access to all online shopping websites and retail outlets from the containment facility was restricted. DSC-MATE-6085 was reprimanded and reminded of the importance of maintaining adherence to all containment protocols.
