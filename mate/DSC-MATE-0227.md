Item #: 227

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 227 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents posing as studio staff. The subject is to be permitted to carry out their duties as a news anchor for public consumption. Should the subject begin to exhibit behavior deemed a risk to national security, Foundation agents are authorized to detain and interrogate the subject.

Description: Subject 227, identified publicly as a male tiger, is a newscaster for a prominent news network. The subject stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 500 pounds. One distinguishing facial feature is the expression of constant fear on the subject's mouth. The subject also wears normal glasses over their eyes and a gold earring in each ear. Two accessories accompany the subject, a red scarf tightly wrapped around the neck and an LED gas mask.

Personality: At times, subject 227 can come off as bossy or intimidating due to their strong and decisive personality. It must be noted, however, that these traits are to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in their role as a news anchor. Underneath the exterior lies an individual who is constantly afraid, either of persecution or retribution for their unique circumstances. 

Addendum: Foundation psychologists have theorized that the red scarf and LED gas mask are utilized as coping mechanisms for a past traumatic experience. Further observation is required to confirm the validity of the theory.
