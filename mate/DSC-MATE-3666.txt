Description: SCP-3666 is a male member of the Cercopithecidae family, classified as a monkey of the Macaca fascicularis species. SCP-3666 stands 1.3 meters tall and weighs 20 kilograms. SCP-3666 is easily recognized by his horned rim glasses and mohawk hairstyle. He is often seen with a cigarette in his hand, which he smokes continuously.

SCP-3666 is known for his natural charm and charisma. He has a talent for making people laugh and is often the life of the party. He is known for telling jokes and doing silly dances, which often lead to humorous situations. SCP-3666 is proud of his physical strength, and he enjoys weightlifting as a hobby.

SCP-3666 was discovered on a farm in rural northern England, where he had been working for many years. He had become a legend among the local farmers, who found his antics amusing. SCP-3666 had managed to avoid detection by the Foundation for many years by living in isolated areas of the farm.

Due to SCP-3666's friendly nature, researchers have been able to establish a rapport with him. He is cooperative and enjoys interacting with the Foundation staff. However, SCP-3666 has shown some signs of intelligence beyond that of a typical monkey. He is capable of using tools and solving puzzles, suggesting higher cognitive abilities.

SCP-3666 is considered a Euclid class anomaly due to his unpredictable behavior. He has been known to lash out at staff members when provoked, but this behavior is rare. The risk of containment breach is low, but all staff members are advised to maintain caution when interacting with SCP-3666.
