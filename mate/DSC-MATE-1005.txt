Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1005 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-19. The subject is permitted to continue their occupation as a banker under close surveillance by Foundation agents. SCP-1005 is to be provided with a basic level of security clearance, and all access to sensitive information is to be strictly monitored. The subject is not permitted to leave Site-19 without prior approval.

Description: SCP-1005 is a human male with several unusual physical features. The subject has spots covering the majority of their face, along with red clown eyes and a frightened mouth that appears to be in a permanent state of expression. SCP-1005's head is that of a monk, with a goggle attached to their forehead, and they wear a medical mask over their mouth. Additionally, the subject has a jade earring in each ear and a red scarf as part of their attire.

SCP-1005 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, likely due to their occupation as a banker. However, the subject also possesses a humorous and lighthearted personality, often acting as the life of the party and getting others to sing and dance along to their favorite songs. SCP-1005's demeanor is overall friendly and approachable, and they appear to enjoy interacting with others.

While SCP-1005's physical appearance is unusual, no anomalous effects have been observed. The subject's unique features are believed to be the result of natural genetic variations rather than any supernatural or scientific causes.

Addendum: On [REDACTED], SCP-1005 displayed an unusual reaction to a security breach at Site-19. The subject exhibited previously unobserved combat abilities and was able to neutralize the security threat without the use of any known weapons or technology. Further investigation into the cause of SCP-1005's increased physical abilities is ongoing.
