SCP-4812, codenamed "The Salesman," is a human male with distinct facial features. He has spots spread across his face, accentuated by his ski goggle eyes that give him an uncanny demeanor. His metal purple head gives him an otherworldly appearance, emphasized even more by his gold earring and silver chain. 

Despite his rather strange look, SCP-4812 is noted for his exceptional charisma and natural talent for leadership. He is a natural-born leader who always finds himself taking charge of situations no matter where he is - be it at work, in a social group, or even in his personal life. 

SCP-4812 works as a car salesman, and he is known for persuading potential buyers to purchase cars that they hadn't set their eyes on before. Rumors have circulated that SCP-4812 possesses some otherworldly powers that allow him to influence people's minds and change their wills. His amiable and persuasive personality enhances these rumors, leaving people in awe of his abilities.

Experiments conducted on SCP-4812 have disproved any sort of supernatural capabilities. However, it is recommended that personnel maintain caution around him and avoid engaging in conversations that may lead to undue influence. SCP-4812 is to be kept in a separate cell from any other SCP for security reasons.
