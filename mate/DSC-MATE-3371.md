Description: Subject 3371 appears to be a female human with distinctive features. They possess a smile that is often disarming and can put those around them at ease. Their eyes are an unusual orange color with eyebrow hues to match. The subject's head is a unique shade of metallic blue, which is complemented by the two-color band on their forehead. Gold earrings and a silver chain are often seen adorning Subject 3371.

The subject is rarely seen without their LED gas mask, which they claim is for "air protection." It is uncertain if the mask serves any additional purpose, as Subject 3371 refuses to elaborate further. Further investigation is required.

Due to the subject's unpredictable behavior, it is suggested that all personnel exercise extreme caution in their interactions with Subject 3371. Any instances of unauthorized psychic behavior must be immediately reported to the appropriate authorities.
