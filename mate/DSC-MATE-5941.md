Item #: 5941

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5941 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. An armed guard must stand outside the cell at all times, ready to use the tranquilizer gun if necessary. DSC-MATE-5941 is to be provided with a steady supply of candy sticks as part of its daily diet.

Description: DSC-MATE-5941 is a male tiger humanoid identified as a traffic officer with a love for adventure. It stands at approximately 2 meters tall and weighs 180 kilograms. DSC-MATE-5941 is adorned with a purple cap with a headset, red cross earring on each ear, a gold chain around its neck, and constantly carries a candy stick in its mouth. 

DSC-MATE-5941's personality is outgoing and adventurous, often leading to humorous stories of near-death experiences like bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. It has heightened senses, particularly in vision and hearing, and is able to see things that humans can't normally perceive. DSC-MATE-5941's claws are sharp enough to rend through flesh and bone with ease, but it appears to have no intention of causing harm to anyone.

DSC-MATE-5941 displays no anomalous qualities outside of its appearance and personality. It is capable of vocal communication, and seems to be able to understand human language. DSC-MATE-5941 has not shown any hostility towards humans or other animals, but should still be treated with caution due to its physical strength and predatory nature. 

Addendum 5941-1: On one occasion, DSC-MATE-5941 managed to escape containment, leading to a brief chase between it and multiple security personnel. It was later found injured and trapped in an alleyway, apparently having sustained injuries from a physical altercation with unknown individuals. Agent G. was the first to approach and calm DSC-MATE-5941 with nothing more than words, emphasizing the need for continued study and containment of humanoid entities.
