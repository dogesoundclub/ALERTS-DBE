Description: 9337 was a male monkey that worked as a delivery driver for a small courier company. Its face featured a frightened look at all times, and it often wore a pair of horn-rimmed glasses over its eyes. It also had a jade earring on one ear and a gold chain around its neck. 

9337 was highly analytical and logical, often taking an almost clinical approach to problem-solving. Despite this, it had a quirky sense of humor, delighting in making witty observations or teasing its friends in a dry, deadpan way. 

As a delivery driver, 9337 was highly skilled, able to navigate even the most complicated routes with ease. It was highly efficient and always made its deliveries on time. 

Unfortunately, while on a delivery mission to a remote area, 9337 encountered a highly dangerous entity and was killed in the line of duty. Despite its neutralization, its legacy remains as a beloved colleague and friend to those who knew it.
