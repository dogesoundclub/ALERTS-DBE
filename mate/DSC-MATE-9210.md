Item #: 9210

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9210 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with furnishings and items suitable for its humanoid form. Standard physical restraints are not required, but personnel are advised to exercise caution during interactions with DSC-MATE-9210, as it retains the physical traits of a dangerous predator.

DSC-MATE-9210 is employed by the local police department and is authorized to carry weapons while on duty. Personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-9210 must be briefed on its anomalous nature and advised to avoid discussing its tiger-like features or other anomalies in its presence.

Description: DSC-MATE-9210 appears as a male humanoid with physical traits similar to those of a Bengal tiger. Its eyes are bright red with vertical pupils, resembling those of a circus clown. DSC-MATE-9210 wears a purple cap with a headset attached and a pair of gold earrings. It also wears a gold chain necklace and often carries a cigarette in its mouth.

DSC-MATE-9210 displays an extreme level of organization and efficiency, with a propensity for taking control of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact manner. Its controlling nature can sometimes lead to humorous situations, particularly in social or professional contexts.

DSC-MATE-9210 is capable of assuming a tiger-like form, which it uses when hunting or in combat situations. Its strength, agility, and predatory instincts are enhanced in this form, and it may become aggressive if provoked or threatened.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9210 was discovered by police officers during a routine traffic stop. Its anomalous nature was not immediately apparent, but it was discovered to be a valuable asset to the department due to its exceptional organizational skills and heightened senses. The Foundation was contacted by local authorities and took custody of DSC-MATE-9210 for containment and study.
