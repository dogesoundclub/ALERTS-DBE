Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7236 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell must be monitored at all times and any attempts at escape should be met with immediate force. SCP-7236 is only permitted to leave its cell with explicit permission from Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-7236 is a tiger who displays physical features commonly associated with human police officers. Its head is adorned with a police cap, and it wears a red cross earring in one ear. Its eyes are an abnormal blue color, resembling clown makeup. SCP-7236 is also often seen carrying a candy stick, which it claims to be its "nightstick."

SCP-7236 works as an electrician in its human guise, and has been observed completing tasks that a typical electrician would be capable of. However, it has displayed a strong sense of independence and a rebellious streak. SCP-7236 frequently disregards authority and rules it deems unnecessary, often sneaking out of its work site early or taking unscheduled days off.

SCP-7236 appears to possess above-average intelligence and linguistic abilities, often engaging in playful banter with its handlers. However, it has displayed an intense distrust of Foundation personnel, frequently testing the limits of its containment procedures.

Addendum: In a recent interview, SCP-7236 revealed that it is aware of its abnormal appearance and attributes it to a "freak accident" during a past altercation with a carnival that had come through its town. SCP-7236 has refused to disclose any further details about the incident. Further investigation into SCP-7236's origins is ongoing.
