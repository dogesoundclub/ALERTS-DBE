Item #: 1100

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1100 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber should be furnished with a bed, a desk, and a computer with access to the internet. SCP-1100 requires a regular diet of fruits and vegetables, and should be permitted to smoke three cigarettes per day. Any attempts to remove SCP-1100's possessions will result in immediate disciplinary action. Interaction with SCP-1100 is permissible, but should be monitored by at least one member of personnel at all times.

Description: SCP-1100 is a monkey, standing 0.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 15 kg. SCP-1100 possesses a set of horned rim glasses and a blue bandana tightly tied around its head as its identifying features, which obscure the majority of its face. SCP-1100 commonly wears a red scarf and smokes cigarettes when allowed to do so. SCP-1100's most prominent face feature is its frightened mouth, which is frequently visible when it is under stress or anxiety. SCP-1100's left ear is adorned with a single gold earring.

SCP-1100 is intelligent and naturally creative, with a particular affinity for brainstorming and problem-solving. It shows a tendency to suggest outlandish solutions and suggestions for problems to see how others will react, which can lead to humorous situations. SCP-1100 is friendly and eager to communicate with those around it, although it can become anxious in stressful situations.

SCP-1100 works as a doctor and has been reported to possess medical knowledge and skills beyond those expected of its species. SCP-1100 is cooperative during medical exams and procedures, but has become agitated during instances when medical equipment is taken away from it. 

Addendum: SCP-1100 has been observed to possess anomalous properties. During one interview, SCP-1100 was able to identify a previously undiscovered treatment for a particular ailment that had stumped human physicians. SCP-1100 has not displayed any intentional control over these abilities and seems unaware of their potential consequences. Further research is required.
