Addendum 1: Incident Log-3382-A

On ██ / ██ / ██ at 14:37, SCP-3382 was undertaking a delivery. While waiting at a stop light, SCP-3382 was challenged by a group of young men in a nearby car. SCP-3382 accepted their challenge and attempted to show off her driving skills. In the process, SCP-3382 struck a tree and caused severe damage to the vehicle. SCP-3382 was injured and required medical assistance. Foundation Agents arrived on the scene and contained the anomaly, providing medical assistance and removing them from the scene.

Addendum 2: Interview Log-3382-A

Dr. █████ began the interview by asking how SCP-3382 felt about their most recent incident. SCP-3382 replied:

"I thought I was a good driver, I never thought I'd have an accident like that. I just wanted to show off a bit, and the next thing I knew, I crashed."

Dr. █████ then questioned SCP-3382 about how they felt about their status as an SCP anomaly. SCP-3382 responded:

"I don't really like being kept in containment, but I understand why it's necessary. I know I make mistakes and I need help controlling my impulses."

Closing Statement: 

Due to the nature of SCP-3382 and its potential risks, it is necessary to limit their movements and monitor their actions. SCP-3382 is capable of complying with these restrictions, and with the proper treatment and therapy, it is believed that SCP-3382 can maintain a level of independent and restricted functioning within the containment facility.
