Item #: 7852

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7852 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. Regular checks should be conducted to ensure the subject's well-being, and any request made by the subject are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Subject's access to gold accessories and candy sticks is restricted unless explicitly requested for testing purposes. Any anomalous activity exhibited by 7852 is to be reported to the site director immediately. 

Description: DSC-MATE-7852 appears to be a common monkey, standing at approximately 0.5 meters tall with a conspicuous parted pinkish fur on its head. The subject has also been observed wearing a gold earring and a gold chain. The subject's most remarkable characteristic, however, is its tendency towards extreme attention to detail. This manifests in many observable ways.

Despite being a self-proclaimed fast food worker, subject 7852 is often observed engaging in repetitive, often mundane tasks such as sorting and alphabetizing objects, including but not limited to candy sticks, coins, and even fast food condiment packets. These tendencies can often border on obsession, which has led to the subject's classification as an DSC entity. 

Addendum: During testing, subjects were asked to categorize a set of objects in a random order. DSC-MATE-7852 successfully assessed the objects based on color, brand, and material in less than half the time when compared to a human control group. It's evident that these obsessive tendencies are not limited to mere mundane tasks alone. Further research must be conducted to understand the true extent of DSC-MATE-7852's anomalous properties. 

According to statements from the subject, the source of its obsessive-compulsive behavior stems from an unexplained urge to categorize, prioritize and group items appropriately. This seems to bring them a sense of balance and satisfaction, allowing them to function optimally within their environment.

DSC-MATE-7852 has shown no sign of aggression or ill-will, and its cooperation during testing has been cooperative. The subject appears to be mostly harmless and could even prove helpful in certain operations requiring meticulous analysis.

Until further testing can be conducted, subject 7852 should remain under observation and cooperative.
