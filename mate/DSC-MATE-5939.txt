Item #: SCP-5939

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5939 is to be kept in isolation at all times, and should only be accessible to authorized personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. No physical contact of any kind is permitted with SCP-5939, as it has been known to exhibit aggressive behavior in the past. Feeding and cleaning will be conducted through automated means to minimize human interaction.

Description: SCP-5939 is a male tiger, standing at 8ft in height when on all fours. Its eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and its head is typically adorned with a bucket hat. SCP-5939 has been observed wearing a gold earring in its left ear, and often carries a whistle as its only known accessory. SCP-5939 is humanoid in appearance, with the ability to walk on two legs for extended periods of time.

SCP-5939 is capable of speech and has been recorded to have an extensive knowledge of a wide variety of subjects, with a particular passion for obscure topics. It has been known to spend long periods researching and studying the materials it has access to, and has demonstrated a willingness to share this knowledge with others.

However, SCP-5939 has also demonstrated a dangerous level of aggression in the past, particularly when it perceives a threat to its safety or the safety of its environment. It is recommended that anyone coming into contact with SCP-5939 exercise caution and avoid triggering its aggressive behavior.

Addendum: SCP-5939 was initially discovered operating a train on a local railway, and was only brought to the attention of the Foundation when its violent nature became apparent. It is believed that SCP-5939 was responsible for several incidents on the railway, resulting in the deaths of multiple civilians. Due to its dangerous nature, SCP-5939 was subsequently contained by Foundation personnel and has remained in containment ever since.
