Item #: 9258

Object Class: Keter

Threat Level: High

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9258 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The walls and floors of this chamber must be reinforced to withstand its immense strength. Any personnel entering SCP-9258's chamber must wear Level 4 Hazardous Material suits as a precautionary measure due to the risk of contamination.

Description: SCP-9258 is a male tiger with a frightened mouth expression. It wears a red beanie on its head, a red cross earring on each ear, a red scarf, and a normal gas mask as its accessories. Despite its cute appearance, SCP-9258 is a highly dangerous villain with a desire to make the world a better place according to its own, twisted standards.

SCP-9258's personality is idealistic and it strongly desires to create a better world. This has led to many humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting companies or causes that SCP-9258 feels go against its values. However, SCP-9258's methods of achieving this goal are often harmful and detrimental to society as a whole. It is known to attack and kill individuals it deems as "corrupt" or "impure", often causing widespread panic and destruction in the process.

SCP-9258 is capable of intelligent speech and has a highly aggressive nature. It possesses superhuman strength and agility, making it a lethal threat to anyone who crosses its path. SCP-9258 is also highly resistant to most conventional weapons and has been known to regenerate from injuries quickly. Its exact origins and the reason for its behavior are currently unknown, and further research is ongoing.

Addendum: Due to SCP-9258's continued threat to society, termination has been approved by the O5 Council. Any personnel involved in this task must exercise extreme caution and follow all protocols for handling a Keter-class entity.
