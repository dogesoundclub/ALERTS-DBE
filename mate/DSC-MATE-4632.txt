Item #: 4632

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4632 is to be monitored within their residence at all times. Any attempt to leave the premises is to be reported immediately to Foundation personnel. In the event that subject 4632 is discovered to be interacting with inanimate objects in any manner, it should be documented for further study.

Description: Subject 4632 is a male human, approximately 30 years of age, with a friendly smile that can be disarming. His head is often adorned with a blue bandana, and sports a pair of goggles on his forehead. A green cross earring is present on his right ear. His mouth is often covered with a medical mask, for reasons currently unknown.

Aside from his quirky sense of fashion, subject 4632 possesses a unique personality trait. He expresses immense care and concern towards inanimate objects around him, going so far as to name his car and talk to his plants. Even household appliances are not exempt from his anthropomorphizing nature. This has led to incidents where the subject has been observed apologizing to a toaster for burning his toast.

Attempts to interview subject 4632 on this behavior have proven futile, as he is reluctant to discuss the matter. Due to the potential anomalous nature of this behavior, Foundation researchers are investigating if subject 4632 has any additional anomalous properties beyond his empathetic nature towards inanimate objects.

As such, subject 4632 is to be monitored closely in the hopes of uncovering any potential threats or useful anomalies he may possess.
