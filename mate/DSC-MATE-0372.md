All meetings with DSC-MATE-372 must be recorded and supervised by at least three armed guards.

Its eyes are blue and have a clownish quality to them. On the forehead, DSC-MATE-372 has a two-color band and a pair of goggles that it wears. DSC-MATE-372 also has a green cross earring in each ear, wears a gold chain, and carries a candy stick.

DSC-MATE-372 has an unusual personality, which is marked by an excessive level of caring and nurturing. This extends not just to other humans, but often to inanimate objects, which DSC-MATE-372 will anthropomorphize and assign personalities to. These behaviors may lead to potential security threats, as DSC-MATE-372 has been known to become emotionally attached to objects deemed dangerous or inappropriate for its level of access.

DSC-MATE-372 has been known to exhibit a strong desire to help others, which can sometimes override its better judgment. We advise against asking DSC-MATE-372 to act in matters of the law, as its impulse to help people may lead to conflicts of interest.

Additional Notes: DSC-MATE-372 has expressed an interest in assisting with the containment of other DSCs, claiming that it would like to help those in need. However, its highly empathetic nature may pose risks to personnel involved in the containment of more dangerous entities.
