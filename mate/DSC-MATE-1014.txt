Item #: SCP-1014

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1014 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-1014 is only permitted with proper authorization from level 3 personnel. Any interaction with SCP-1014 must be monitored at all times for potential anomalous behavior. SCP-1014 is permitted to possess a choker and a cigarette as personal belongings.

Description: SCP-1014 is a female human with spotted skin and red clown eyes. Its head is green with edge curl, and it wears a single jade earring. SCP-1014 works as a banker and appears to possess a no-nonsense attitude, but also has a playful side that can lead to humorous situations. SCP-1014 values tradition and often shares jokes and stories that have been passed down through its family or community.

SCP-1014's anomalous effects manifest when it speaks in a language that is not native to its listeners. Any individual hearing SCP-1014 speak in an unfamiliar language will experience hallucinations of their worst fears or phobias. These hallucinations will persist for several hours after exposure and have been described as highly vivid and immersive.

SCP-1014's anomalous effects are not active when it speaks in its native language or a language that has been learned through immersion.

Addendum: SCP-1014 has been used successfully in multiple interrogation and containment breach scenarios where exposure to hostile entities or individuals was necessary. Its use in combat situations is currently under consideration.
