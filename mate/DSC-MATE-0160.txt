Item #: 160

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 160 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. Any contact must be approved by a Level 3 personnel. Subject is not to be allowed access to any plant life, inanimate objects or mechanical entities. In the event of any unusual behavior, such as talking to inanimate objects, or treating them as sentient beings, a full psychological evaluation must be conducted immediately.

Description: Subject 160 appears to be a typical human female, dressed in an 00s school girl uniform, accessorized with a red cross earring, gold chain and LED gas mask. However, the most striking feature of the subject are its eyes, which resemble those of a clown, a bright red which contrasts sharply with her dark hair. 

Personality: Subject 160 is nurturing and compassionate to the point that it extends to inanimate objects. The subject has been known to name her car, talk to her plants, and even behave as if her household appliances are sentient beings. While such behavior may seem unusual, it has resulted in the subject exhibiting instances of telekinesis that have yet to be explained. 

Addendum: While the origins of the subject's behavior are still unknown, it is crucial to maintain the containment procedures outlined above to prevent any potential harm both to the subject and those around her. Any changes in the subject's behavior must be relayed to a Level 3 personnel immediately. End log.
