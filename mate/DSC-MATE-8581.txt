Item #: 8581

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8581 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access is restricted to Level 2 personnel with supervision.

Description: SCP-8581 is a sapient rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, standing at 1.2 meters tall. Its eyes are fitted with VR Rainbow LED technology, and it wears a bucket hat as its headpiece. SCP-8581's ears sport a gold earring and a silver chain serves as a necklace accessory.

SCP-8581 displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more than it can handle, resulting in humorous situations. The rabbit is a proficient programmer, capable of writing and executing code at an astonishing rate. Its work is of exceptional quality and is always delivered on time.

SCP-8581's anomalous properties manifest during programming sessions, wherein it enters a trance-like state, where it interfaces directly with any electronic device that it can connect to. SCP-8581 is capable of overloading and corrupting a device's software or hardware, causing them to malfunction, sometimes resulting in devastating effects.

SCP-8581 is to be fed a standard diet of fresh vegetables and is to be provided with an electronic device for use during programming sessions.

Addendum: SCP-8581 was discovered by Foundation agents after multiple reports were received of a rogue coder employed by multiple technology firms who caused significant damage to hardware and software. Upon investigation, SCP-8581 was apprehended and transported to Site-██ for containment.
