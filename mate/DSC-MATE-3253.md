Subject 3253's personality is characterized by a strong sense of nurturing and caring.

Despite her empathetic nature, Subject 3253 is introverted and avoids large crowds or any social interactions that may cause discomfort.

Addendum: Subject 3253's employment as a reporter has proven to be a useful tool in keeping tabs on any incidents or phenomena that could pose a threat to human life.

All investigations must be approved by the appropriate authorities before she is allowed to proceed.
