Item #: SCP-6001

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6001 is to be allowed to continue her position as news anchor with regular performance evaluations conducted by Foundation personnel. She is to be monitored for any abnormal behavior, especially concerning unusual interests or sources of information.

Description: SCP-6001 is a human female in her mid-30s with features consistent with those of a 00s school girl. She has long, curly black hair and red lips, and her eyebrows are orange in color. She is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck, paired with a gold earring in each ear.

Personality-wise, SCP-6001 is highly curious and has a deep thirst for knowledge. She enjoys spending long hours reading and researching, and will often hoard books or other educational materials. Despite her secretive behavior, she can become quite enthusiastic when sharing her newfound knowledge with others, sometimes to the point of recklessness.

SCP-6001's job as a news anchor allows her to have access to a vast amount of information. She will often use her position to look into obscure topics, sometimes crossing ethical boundaries or revealing information not meant for public consumption. It is unknown if SCP-6001 has any anomalous abilities that enable her to gather information more efficiently than a normal human.

Addendum: Despite her seemingly harmless behavior, SCP-6001's fixation on learning may pose a risk to the secrecy of the Foundation's existence. All personnel are advised to monitor her closely and report any suspicious behavior immediately.
