Item #: SCP-2130

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2130 is to be contained within standard humanoid containment quarters at Site-██. Permission for recreational activities and outdoor exercise are approved on a case-by-case basis, as SCP-2130's behavior is considered unpredictable. Security personnel are to be on high alert when interacting with SCP-2130.

Description: SCP-2130 is a human female identified as an electrician by trade. Her facial features include spots and a constant smile, which lead to her nickname "Spot Smile." SCP-2130's eyes are red clown eyes, which do not affect her vision. Her head is reminiscent of a 00s schoolgirl, and she wears a two-color band on her forehead as an accessory. SCP-2130 is often seen with a cigarette.

SCP-2130's personality is described as impulsive and spontaneous, often leading to impromptu actions and risky behavior. SCP-2130 has exhibited a tendency to jump off cliffs into bodies of water without warning. Although this can be humorous at times, SCP-2130's unpredictability makes her difficult to manage.

Addendum 2130-A: SCP-2130 was recovered by Foundation personnel responding to a string of bizarre electrical accidents in the town of ████████, ██. Due to SCP-2130's unique abilities, she is a valuable asset for electrical-based containment breaches. However, due to her impulsive behavior, she is considered a high-risk asset and is to be monitored closely.
