Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1516 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with heavy-duty restraints at all times. Under no circumstances should any personnel make direct eye contact with DSC-MATE-1516, as it poses an immediate and significant threat to their safety. All interactions with DSC-MATE-1516 must be conducted remotely, utilizing video and audio monitoring equipment.

Description: DSC-MATE-1516 is a male Bengal tiger that possesses exceptional intelligence and cognitive abilities. DSC-MATE-1516 is capable of complex problem-solving and displays a highly analytical mind, which makes it a formidable threat to containment personnel. DSC-MATE-1516's most distinctive feature is the two-color band on its forehead and the goggles that it keeps propped above its eyes. It also wears a jade earring in its right ear and a medical mask over its mouth.

DSC-MATE-1516 is an acute danger, as it exhibits a strong inclination to play with human minds. DSC-MATE-1516 is known to be a natural brainstormer, often coming up with unconventional and outlandish solutions to problems, which may initially seem amusing but exhibit potentially catastrophic results. DSC-MATE-1516's actions often leave the Foundation's containment teams confused and disoriented.

DSC-MATE-1516's anomaly allows it to project its ideas and creative solutions as thought waves to nearby personnel, rendering them susceptible to its suggestions. The effect is intensified if DSC-MATE-1516 makes direct eye contact with any person, making it difficult to resist its influence.

DSC-MATE-1516 is hostile towards Foundation personnel and is categorized as a villainous entity. Any attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-1516 must be conducted remotely and with extreme caution.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1516 is considered a high-priority target for re-containment given its potential to cause a massive breach. Research is ongoing as to the origin of DSC-MATE-1516's abilities and any possible ties to other anomalous entities. Until further notice, all personnel are urged to follow strict containment protocol and avoid any direct or indirect interactions with DSC-MATE-1516.
