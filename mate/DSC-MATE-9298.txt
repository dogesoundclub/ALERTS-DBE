Item #: SCP-9298

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9298 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. A set of gardening tools must be provided for SCP-9298 to satisfy their desire to nurture plants. All personnel assigned to SCP-9298 must wear Level A hazmat suits with a built-in communication system for emergency situations. Under no circumstances should SCP-9298 be allowed to leave their cell without proper authorization from at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: 

SCP-9298 is a female human of average height and weight, with orange stripes on her face and a distinct pink rabbit head. SCP-9298 has blue clown eyes that emit a bright glow in low light conditions. SCP-9298 is often seen wearing a normal gas mask and a choker around her neck.

SCP-9298 has mild anomalous properties that appear to affect her memory and cognitive abilities. SCP-9298 can be forgetful and absent-minded, often losing track of time or appointments. However, SCP-9298's condition is not related to any known mental disorder and seems to be a natural characteristic.

SCP-9298 has an extraordinary love for plants and has the ability to grow and nurture them at a rapid rate. SCP-9298's anomalous properties make the plants grow ten times faster than normal, with a unique appearance and taste. SCP-9298 claims that plants are their only source of companionship and talks to them often.

Addendum: 

SCP-9298 was discovered on a small farm in rural ██████ where she worked as a farmer. The Foundation was alerted after reports of unusual plant growth in the surrounding area. SCP-9298 was taken into custody without incident and transported to Site-██ for containment. Further tests are being conducted to determine the extent of her anomaly, and possible uses for agricultural and ecological purposes.
