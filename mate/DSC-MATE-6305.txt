Item #: SCP-6305

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6305 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-6305 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above with authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-6305 is not to be placed in contact with any other SCPs due to potential emotional and psychological distress.

Description: SCP-6305 is a female human with several unique physical characteristics. SCP-6305 exhibits spotted skin patterns and wears a red lipstick. SCP-6305's eyes resemble those of a clown, appearing red in color. SCP-6305's head is covered in brown hair typical of the 1990s.

SCP-6305 wears a normal gas mask as an accessory, despite the lack of any discernible reason. SCP-6305's most notable trait is a pair of jade earrings worn in both ears.

SCP-6305 possesses an empathetic and compassionate personality, often taking on the emotional burdens of those around her. This trait can lead to SCP-6305 feeling responsible for fixing the problems of others, often to her own detriment. SCP-6305's emotional state is particularly sensitive compared to typical human subjects.

Addendum: Investigation by Foundation personnel determined that SCP-6305's sensitivity is not anomalous in origin. SCP-6305 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and has been deemed safe for continued containment. Personnel are encouraged to show SCP-6305 respect and understanding to avoid undue emotional harm.
