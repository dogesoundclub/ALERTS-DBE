Item #: SCP-4008

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4008 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell and provided with appropriate accommodations for a rabbit humanoid. Access to SCP-4008 is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel or above. Any experimentation involving SCP-4008 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-4008 is a male rabbit humanoid standing at 1.5 meters in height on its hind legs. It has a frightened mouth, which is always present on its face. SCP-4008's most notable feature is its bright red clown eyes that glow in the dark. It is usually seen wearing a bucket hat and a jade earring on its left ear. SCP-4008 commonly uses a silver chain as a fashion accessory, and an LED gas mask to cover its mouth.

SCP-4008 is a fashion designer who has shown remarkable organizational skills and efficiency. This trait can be somewhat controlling at times, leading to humorous situations where SCP-4008 takes charge of group projects, delegating tasks to others in a matter-of-fact manner. Despite its consummate professionalism, SCP-4008 displays a deep-seated fear of failure and a general uneasiness when left alone for prolonged periods.

SCP-4008 is capable of communicating in multiple languages, and shows a deep understanding of fashion and design. SCP-4008's creations are frequently popular, with demand for its designs continually increasing. SCP-4008's fashion shows often demonstrate an uncanny ability to fashion garments that are both stylish and aesthetically pleasing.

Addendum: SCP-4008's creations are considered to have anomalous properties. As a result, the Foundation has been monitoring SCP-4008's fashion shows and productions for signs of potential breaches or security risks. SCP-4008 has been cooperative in all security matters, and any anomalies discovered have been contained without incident.
