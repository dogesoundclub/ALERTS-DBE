SCP-1714 is a dangerous villainous entity that takes the shape of a male tiger. Classified as Keter, his cunningly agile nature has made him a difficult target for our agents. What sets this anomaly apart is the peculiar fashion and style he adorns himself with. He is often observed wearing a purple cap with a built-in headset, protecting him from any unwanted sound waves making their way through his furry ears adorned with a gold earring. SCP-1714 further accessorizes its appearance with a silver chain and candy stick which it often chews on relentlessly. 

However, do not let his strange fashion sense fool you. SCP-1714 is an intelligent and calculated being, often using his unique skillset to outsmart his foes by trying new approaches to capture his prey. Even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, SCP-1714 rarely backs down from a challenge. This love for adventure also leads to some humorous tales, such as near-death experiences while bungee jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. Despite his apparent zest for life, SCP-1714 has a dark side that needs to be contained at all costs. 

Any interactions with SCP-1714 require extreme caution, as even the slightest provocation may lead to tragic and fatal consequences. Any sightings of SCP-1714 must be reported to the highest authorities immediately.
