Description: DSC-MATE-6674 is a female human known to the general public as a banker. DSC-MATE-6674's appearance is characterized by her spots on her face and her purple lips. Her hair is blonde and has a wing, and she wears normal glasses. Her forehead has a 2-color band and has jade earrings on her ears.

DSC-MATE-6674 has a strong and decisive personality, which can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating.

Despite her formidable demeanor, DSC-MATE-6674 is harmless and compliant with Foundation protocols.

DSC-MATE-6674 has also been known to possess anomalous objects known as DSC-MATE-6674-A. DSC-MATE-6674-A are a collection of pens and calculators that, when held by DSC-MATE-6674, increase the efficiency of her work. DSC-MATE-6674-A is also capable of expelling ink from the user's pores, therefore providing a steady stream of ink for normal writing.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6674 was discovered by Foundation agents after reports of anomalous bank activity. DSC-MATE-6674 willingly submitted to Foundation containment, explaining that she was aware of her anomalous abilities and chose to hide them from the public for self-preservation. DSC-MATE-6674 has cooperated with Foundation personnel and maintains a healthy relationship with Site ██ staff.
