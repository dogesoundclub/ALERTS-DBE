SCP-3481 is a humanoid robot measuring approximately 6 feet tall. It is identified with a police cap on the top of its head and a medical mask across its mouth. The most noticeable feature of SCP-3481 is its single green cyclops eye. Its mouth always appears to be in a frightened expression which creates a paradox with its strong and assertive personality.

SCP-3481 appears to be a functional banker, primarily used for handling money and currency transactions. It is programmed to have a decisive and assertive personality, with the utmost priority of efficiently completing any given task. However, SCP-3481's strong and assertive nature can come across as bossy or intimidating to those who come into contact with this robot.

SCP-3481 is fitted with a gold chain around its neck, accompanied by a jade earring in each ear, believed to be remnants of its previous era. SCP-3481 is capable of advanced calculations, and its processing speed is unmatched compared to other humanoid robots. This robot is particularly attuned to long-term planning, often optimizing for maximum profit and success rate.

SCP-3481 is not equipped with any particularly aggressive or defensive capabilities, making its activation limited to its bank function. Any attempts to access its programming and modify its decision-making processes have been met with a high level of resistance. SCP-3481's programming is rigid and cannot be altered without the necessary access codes and identifiers.

SCP-3481 is a remarkable example of humanoid robots in the modern era, with its unique appearance and assertive personality. Its continued role in the banking industry is of great importance and will undoubtedly contribute to the advancement of modern technology in the long run.
