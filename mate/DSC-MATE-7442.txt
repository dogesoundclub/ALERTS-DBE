SCP-7442, codenamed "Fast Food Hopper," is a sentient Rabbit of unknown origin who operates as a Fast Food Worker. Despite possessing the appearance of a docile and timid creature, SCP-7442 has the ability to communicate in human language fluently, albeit with a constant trembling voice evident of its anxiety.

SCP-7442's most distinctive features include its large, nerdy glasses that often reflect the spotlight from the fast food counter, and a constant expression of fear with its mouth agape. SCP-7442's head sports an eccentric shock of green hair tucked under a purple cap, which is believed to be the result of SCP-7442's personal identity quirk.

It is also worth noting that SCP-7442 carries a whistle at all times, which it uses to alert its coworkers of emergency situations, such as accidents or incidents with customers. However, SCP-7442 is wary of using the whistle, as it has a fear of attracting attention to itself.

SCP-7442's personality traits are primarily reflective of its emotional intelligence. It shows an intuitive understanding of their innermost feelings and can empathize with others on a deep level. It is not unusual to find SCP-7442 wiping tears away during sentimental moments in movies or music that elicits strong feelings. SCP-7442's fondness for emotional expression may be attributed to its own struggle with anxiety, which makes it appreciate art forms that provide relief for its troubled mind.

Special Containment Procedures dictate that all interactions with SCP-7442 should be carried out with the utmost consideration to their emotions. Any form of aggression or intimidation is strictly prohibited. Access to the whistle should be granted to SCP-7442 at all times, and all staff should be trained to respond to its emergency signals promptly.
