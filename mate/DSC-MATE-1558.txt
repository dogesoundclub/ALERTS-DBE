SCP-1558, also known as "The Tiger Salesman", is a highly enigmatic and charismatic individual. Despite appearing completely human, this individual boasts some highly unusual physical traits. The most striking of these is the orange stripes that adorn his face, which are highly reminiscent of those found on a tiger's fur. In addition, he often dons ski goggle-like ocular attachments, which only add to the mystique of his appearance.

Despite his somewhat intimidating physical presence, SCP-1558 possesses a highly magnetic and approachable personality. They have a natural inclination towards leadership, and are often called upon to take charge of situations. This is a characteristic that is evident both in their professional and personal lives. In fact, it is believed that this ability to lead is what has made SCP-1558 such a successful used car salesman.

Despite SCP-1558's magnetic personality and professional success, there are some who remain wary of this enigmatic individual. Despite appearing completely human, there are some who believe that there is something supernatural about them. Indeed, the striking physical appearance and natural leadership qualities of SCP-1558 suggest that they may not be entirely of this world. However, until further evidence is found, SCP-1558 remains classified as a purely human phenomenon.
