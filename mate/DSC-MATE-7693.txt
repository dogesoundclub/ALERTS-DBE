Description: SCP-7693 is a human male of average height and build. Its face is characterized by various spots, which are believed to be a natural skin condition. SCP-7693 frequently wears nerd glasses and a hoodie, as well as a silver chain and cigarette.

SCP-7693 functions as a firefighter for the local Fire Department. Despite its impulsive behavior, it has demonstrated an above-average ability to respond to emergency situations and save lives. Due to its involvement in rescue operations, SCP-7693 has come into contact with various anomalous entities. It has shown no signs of anomalous abilities or awareness.

In the process of evacuating civilians, SCP-7693 discovered a hidden basement containing several anomalous objects. SCP-7693 reported the discovery to the Foundation liaison and assisted in securing the objects. SCP-7693 was administered Class-B amnestics and reprimanded for failing to report the discovery sooner.
