SCP-3230 - The Politician

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-3230 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents equipped with standard surveillance equipment. Any suspicious activity or behavior exhibited by SCP-3230 is to be reported immediately to higher authorities. SCP-3230 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times unless authorized for meetings, interviews, or public appearances.

Description:
SCP-3230 is a human male of approximately 45 years old. They stand at an average height and weight, with the distinguishing feature of orange stripes across their face. Their eyes emit a bright rainbow LED, and they prefer to wear a retro cap, gold earring, and stylish attire.

SCP-3230's personality comprises natural leadership qualities and a drive to take control of any situation concerning their work, social circle, or private life. They tend to exude charisma and charm, which appeals to most people, making them a public figure of authority.

SCP-3230's anomalous properties lie in their ability to influence people quickly and efficiently with their speech and leadership qualities. Their presence can significantly impact the surrounding area, influencing people's emotions and behaviors.

Test subjects exposed to SCP-3230's speeches exhibit heightened loyalty, obedience, and suggestibility. SCP-3230 can bend individuals to their will, even influencing their memories or erasing them altogether. However, SCP-3230's abilities require them to be present in the same room as their subjects for their powers to work effectively.

SCP-3230's political career has been intentionally upheld by the Foundation to maintain stability in their area of operation. Their political power helps to divert attention from the organization's covert activities, keeping the city's supernatural entities in check.

Conclusion:
SCP-3230's containment and monitoring remain crucial to the Foundation's success in maintaining secrecy while preserving stability in the city. Further testing and observation of SCP-3230's abilities are necessary for the development of countermeasures against their anomalous effects.
