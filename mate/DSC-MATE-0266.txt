Item #: 266

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject, designated as 266, is to be kept in a secure location within a designated urban farm. The farm must maintain a low profile and be located in an area with little to no public access. The subject must be provided with a steady supply of fresh vegetables and water. In case of emergency, personnel are advised to approach the subject with caution as it may become agitated if it feels threatened.

Description: SCP-266 is a male rabbit with a frightened mouth, normal glasses for eyes, and a silver chain. It also wears a gas mask with LED lighting and goggles on its forehead. SCP-266 is able to communicate through a series of chirps and body language.

SCP-266 is a sentient being and has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, particularly in regards to its duties as a farmer. It is often seen carrying multiple items at once, which has led to some humorous situations where it struggles to handle everything at once.

SCP-266 is generally cooperative and obedient when given instructions, although it can become stubborn and resistant when it feels that its safety or the safety of its crops are at risk. In dire situations, SCP-266 has been known to use its agility and stamina to outmaneuver potential threats.

Addendum: SCP-266 has demonstrated an unusual level of intelligence and resourcefulness, particularly when it comes to farming techniques. It has been observed using innovative methods to improve crop yields, such as using companion planting and natural fertilizers. As such, SCP-266 could potentially be a valuable asset to any agricultural initiatives undertaken by the Foundation.
