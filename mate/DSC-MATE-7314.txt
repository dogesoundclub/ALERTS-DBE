Item #: SCP-7314

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7314 is to be contained in a specially designed pen with reinforced walls and metal bars. Under no circumstances should SCP-7314 be released from containment without authorization from at least two Level 4 personnel. SCP-7314 is to be provided with fresh meat, water, and a steady supply of its favorite type of music in order to maintain its mental stability.

Description: SCP-7314 is a male tiger with red clown eyes, walking on two legs and wearing a police cap. Its forehead features a two-color band, and jade earrings adorn its ears, along with a gold chain around its neck. Though SCP-7314's physical appearance is highly unusual, it is its personality that sets it apart from other members of its species.

SCP-7314 is highly intelligent and speaks several languages fluently. It has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which was the primary reason why it chose to become a doctor. SCP-7314 is an exceptional physician, often going above and beyond the call of duty to help its patients. However, it also has a playful, mischievous side, and loves to dance and sing along to its favorite songs, often getting others to join in with it.

SCP-7314's behavior can be unpredictable at times, and it should be approached with caution. Though it has never demonstrated outright hostility towards staff members or other subjects, its claws and teeth are highly dangerous, and it possesses superior strength and speed, making it a formidable opponent if provoked.

Addendum: SCP-7314 has expressed a desire to have access to a piano or other musical instrument, claiming that it would help it relax and better perform its duties as a doctor. The request is currently under consideration by O5 personnel.
