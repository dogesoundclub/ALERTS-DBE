DSC-MATE-4674, formally known as the "Independent Banker", is a male human with distinctive features. Notably, his head is covered in multiple overlapping layers of green, resembling a plethora of leaves or scales. He sports a jade earring on each ear and is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck.

In addition to his bizarre appearance, DSC-MATE-4674 carries with him a candy stick, which he seems to enjoy sucking on throughout the day. Unfortunately, his love for sweets does not match his stubbornness.

DSC-MATE-4674 has a strong sense of independence and rarely asks for help, even when it would be beneficial for him to do so. He often finds himself in humorous predicaments, such as attempting to move a heavy object by himself or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost.

It is uncertain if his reluctance to ask for help is due to a personality trait or a result of his altered appearance. Regardless, caution should be taken when interacting with DSC-MATE-4674 to avoid causing unnecessary frustration or unproductive floundering.
