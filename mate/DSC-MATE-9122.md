Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9122, known as "the Firefighter," is to be kept in a secure location at all times. The containment chamber should be furnished with a fire suppression system and a fireproof wall, as well as a set of titanium-reinforced shackles to secure the subject during feeding.

Description: Subject 9122 appears to be a large male tiger, standing at a height of 6'2" and weighing approximately 280lbs. The subject's most notable feature is its unsettling red clown eyes, which are always aglow with a fiery intensity. It also wears a red cross earring in its left ear and a silver chain around its neck.

The subject displays highly idealistic tendencies and a desire to make the world a better place. It often engages in protests and boycotting activities against companies or causes that it deems to be against its values. The Firefighter possesses an unparalleled ability to sense fire and can sense the tiniest traces of smoke from several miles away. It also has some degree of pyrokinesis and is able to summon and control flames.

Addendum: Research into the origin of Subject 9122 is ongoing, but it is believed that the creature is a product of a highly secretive tiger breeding experiment that aimed to create a new breed of firefighting animals. Further investigation may be necessary to ascertain the full extent of the subject's abilities and limitations.
