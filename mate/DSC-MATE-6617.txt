SCP-6617, known by their civilian name as Train Driver Green, is a human female with a striking appearance. Their face is emphasized by bright red lip color, and their eyes are adorned with virtual reality jade LED lenses. SCP-6617's head is adorned with vivid green hair that has a distinctive edge curl. 

Personality-wise, SCP-6617 can be quite unpredictable. They have a dry sense of humor which can catch people off guard. Even though they don't view themselves as the life-and-soul of the party, SCP-6617's deadpan jokes can be surprisingly hilarious. 

SCP-6617's job as a train driver is crucial, given their ability to interact with civilians about their daily routines. Personnel should remember that SCP-6617 is a human rather than a creature for study as a consequence of being assigned an SCP number. SCP-6617 is of crucial importance in civilian human interactions, and personnel should operate accordingly in any foundation-related missions.
