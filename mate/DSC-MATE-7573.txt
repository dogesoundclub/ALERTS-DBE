Item #: SCP-7573

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7573 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. It is permitted to work as a fast food worker at a designated establishment, provided that it does not breach the secrecy of the Foundation. SCP-7573 is to be strictly monitored for any unusual behavior or activities.

Description: SCP-7573 is a male monkey of unknown origin. Its eyes are covered by horned rim glasses and it has normal black hair. SCP-7573 is often seen wearing a red scarf and an LED gas mask as accessories. It possesses an extraordinary level of creativity and a vivid imagination which is evident in its unusual hobbies and interests. It enjoys activities such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting various unusual objects.

SCP-7573's abilities are remarkably different from any other primate, being capable of mimicking verbal communication in over eight languages, memorizing intricate sequences and patterns with ease, and performing complex calculations at an alarming speed. In addition to its cognitive capabilities, SCP-7573 has also demonstrated impressive physical skills, being able to navigate obstacles with ease and jump over four times its own height.

SCP-7573's anomalous abilities have led to it being of interest to various groups outside of the Foundation. It is imperative that SCP-7573's true nature and abilities are kept secret to prevent it from being exploited.

Personality: SCP-7573 is friendly and enjoys socializing with others but can display signs of anxiety when it feels threatened or under too much pressure. It has demonstrated a fondness for human food, particularly fast food, which is most likely the reason it chose to work at a fast food restaurant. SCP-7573's need for creativity and mental stimulation can be fulfilled by providing it with various activities that encourage it to continue developing its skills.

Addendum: SCP-7573 has shown an interest in joining the Foundation's research team. Consideration of SCP-7573's application is currently under review.
