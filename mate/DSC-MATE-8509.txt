SCP Foundation Description:


Object #: SCP-8509

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8509 is to remain at Site-███ and is to be monitored at all times by no fewer than two (2) security personnel. SCP-8509 must be provided with a suitable workplace where she is allowed to perform duties within the bounds of her job as an electrician whilst under close supervision of Foundation personnel. SCP-8509 is not to be granted access to any equipment or materials that may be harmful to herself, personnel or the facility.

SCP-8509 is also required to participate in regular psychological evaluations to assess her behavioural tendencies for any signs of violent or abnormal behavior.

SCP-8509 is to be dressed in adjusted clothing to obscure her anomalous facial features (i.e. orange side and orange stripes). If SCP-8509 attempts to remove or modify the adjusted clothing, personnel are authorised to use non-lethal force in the interests of containment.

Description: SCP-8509 is a human female with distinct physical abnormalities, including orange stripes and a purple lip. SCP-8509's hair is styled in an orange side, and she frequently adorns her forehead with goggles as well as gold earrings. SCP-8509 often carries a cigarette with her.

SCP-8509 has demonstrated traits of rebellion and enjoys pushing boundaries, believed to be a personality trait linked to her anomalous features. She has shown iterative tendencies to break rules or bend them for her own amusement, leading to humorous or dangerous situations which pose a risk of containment breach.

SCP-8509 has the ability to manipulate electric currents that pass through her body, resulting in disastrous electrical surges if left unchecked. It is important that SCP-8509's electrical activities are monitored and constrained in a controlled environment.

Addendum:

SCP-8509 exhibits a complex personality and therefore presents ethical challenges for the Foundation's containment procedures. Ongoing psychological evaluation of SCP-8509's behavior is necessary to ensure safety of personnel and maintained containment.
