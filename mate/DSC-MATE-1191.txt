Item #: SCP-1191

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1191 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell. All aspects of his daily routine must be monitored by at least two personnel at all times. Special attention must be paid to SCP-1191 during maintenance work, as he has been observed to become easily distracted and absent-minded.

Description: SCP-1191 is a human male of average height and weight. He has normal vision and wears glasses. SCP-1191 is usually seen wearing a bucket hat and a jade earring in his left ear. He identifies himself as a mechanic and is particularly skilled at fixing cars and other machinery.

SCP-1191's personality is characterized by his tendency to daydream and become lost in thought. He has been observed walking into poles and tripping over objects while in this state. Despite his absent-mindedness, SCP-1191 is a skilled mechanic and has been successful in fixing machines that other technicians have failed to repair.

SCP-1191's introspective nature has led to his fascination with the supernatural and the occult. However, he does not possess any anomalous abilities or knowledge.

Addendum: In Incident Report 1191-Alpha, SCP-1191 accidentally activated a piece of anomalous machinery while lost in thought. The machine caused a minor containment breach, but SCP-1191 was able to swiftly repair the damage. As a result of the incident, all maintenance work is to be performed under strict supervision.
