Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9622 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██.

Description: SCP-9622 is a male human, measuring 1.83 meters in height and weighing approximately 77.1 kilograms. The subject's facial features include a singular spot near the corner of the mouth and a constant smile. The eyes are blue and possess an abnormal clown-like appearance. The subject's head is of normal size but its hair coloration is a not-arranged shade of green.

SCP-9622 frequently wears a pair of goggles on their forehead and a green cross earring. Additionally, they often wear a gold chain around their neck as an accessory.

SCP-9622's personality is characterized by a propensity for organization and planning, often being able to anticipate and act accordingly in various situations. However, SCP-9622 also possesses a spontaneous side that engenders humor and a sense of surprise among acquaintances. These impulsive tendencies manifest in team outings, party planning, and other situations, in which SCP-9622 enjoys receiving positive attention from those they socialize with.

SCP-9622's current occupation is that of a veterinarian, the purpose of which is unknown to the Foundation. While SCP-9622's employment does not pose a direct threat to the public or the Foundation, all information regarding their professional life and colleagues is to be contained and monitored. 

Addendum: It is worth noting that SCP-9622's green hair is not derived from any known genetic anomaly or exposure to chemicals. Instead, it is the result of a personal choice to utilize a hair dye that is long-lasting and non-toxic. SCP-9622 has been cooperative with all testing and research, and has not shown any signs of anomalous properties outside of their unique physical appearance.
