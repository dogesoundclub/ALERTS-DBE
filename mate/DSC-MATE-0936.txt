SCP-936, also known as "The Clown Vet," is a male human who works as a veterinarian in an urban setting. He is easily identified by his unique orange stripes that adorn his face, which offer a distinct contrast to his bright red clown eyes. The subject's ears are also adorned with a gold earring, and he wears a silver chain around his neck.

However, the most distinguishing aspect of SCP-936's appearance is his LED gas mask that he wears at all times. This device is thought to be a tool for preserving the subject's anonymity and concealing his identity from others in public.

Despite his unusual appearance, SCP-936 is known for his great sense of humor and is often described as a prankster. He enjoys making others laugh and may engage in playful acts, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood.

While the subject's behavior can often be unpredictable, SCP-936 is considered harmless and does not pose a threat to others. Due to his friendly nature and expertise as a veterinarian, the subject is often sought after for his services, especially by those in the local circus and carnival industries. However, due to his anomalous traits, SCP-936 is to be closely monitored and contained to prevent any potential breaches or harm to himself or others.
