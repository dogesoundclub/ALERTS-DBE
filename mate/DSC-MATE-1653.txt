Item #: 1653

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #1653 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-17. The enclosure must not contain any openings larger than 2.54cm in diameter. The enclosure should be periodically cleaned by authorized personnel. The subject should be provided with a cup of water, a carrot and a fresh cigarette upon request. 

Description: Item #1653 is a male rabbit approximately 0.45 meters in height. The subject has red clown eyes and wears a hoodie with a red victory band on the forehead. The rabbit is frequently seen with a silver chain hanging around the neck and holding a cigarette between its lips. 

The subject displayed a strong sense of independence which is typical of its species. It's known to be reluctant to seek help from others even when it is required. This often causes the rabbit to get into humorous situations such as attempting to move a heavy object without assistance, or refusing to use a map when lost. 

Though the Item #1653 is generally friendly, it has displayed aggressive behavior when it feels threatened or cornered. The rabbit has also demonstrated the ability to communicate using an unknown language, which is yet to be deciphered. 

Addendum: During recent tests, Item #1653 has shown a great attraction to cars and salesmanship. As a result, it was provided with a job as a car salesman under the SCP foundation. The subject has proven to be an efficient salesman, often closing deals within minutes of interacting with customers. Its interaction with customers should be monitored at all times. 

Note: Any personnel wishing to interact with Item #1653 should be aware of its spontaneous behavior and unpredictable nature. Contact Site-17 administration for authorization before any communication or interaction with the subject.
