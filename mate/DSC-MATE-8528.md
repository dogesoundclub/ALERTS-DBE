Dr. ██████: Good afternoon, DSC-MATE-8528. Can you tell me about your current assignment as a reporter?

DSC-MATE-8528: Absolutely! I'm currently covering a story about the increase in paranormal activity in the city. It's really exciting because it's a topic that has always fascinated me, and I'm hoping to bring some attention to the issue.

Dr. ██████: I see. How do you feel about anomalous entities?

DSC-MATE-8528: Well, I think they're fascinating! They bring something new and exciting to the world, and I believe that we should learn as much as we can about them. That's why I love being a journalist - I get to uncover the unknown and share it with others!

Dr. ██████: That's understandable. However, as you may know, the Foundation operates to protect the Veil and prevent the public from knowing about the existence of anomalous entities. What are your thoughts on that?
