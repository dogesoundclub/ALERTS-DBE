Item #: 8835

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8835 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents posing as political aides. It is imperative that her appearances and speeches are controlled to not arouse suspicion among the general public. SCP-8835 is prohibited from entering any Foundation facility and interacting with other SCPs without prior approval.

Description: SCP-8835 is a female human politician who possesses a unique anomaly. Her head is anatomically similar to that of a pink rabbit, with the rest of her body unchanged. SCP-8835's eyes are an unusual orange hue, and her eyebrows are thin and arched. Her ears are adorned with red cross-shaped earrings, and she is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-8835's personality is characterized by her exceptional ability to observe and pay attention to details. This trait makes her a skilled gift-giver, as she often presents personalized gifts based on her observations. However, this same ability can make her excessively obsessed with finding the "perfect" gift for someone, leading to prolonged periods of indecisiveness and over-analyzing.

SCP-8835's speeches and public appearances follow a typical political style, with messages promoting equality, social justice, and community development. However, her wording and delivery have been noted as carrying a subliminal effect on listeners, causing them to perceive SCP-8835 as an authority figure.

Addendum: SCP-8835's anomaly has made her the subject of many conspiracy theories and paranormal urban legends. The Foundation's efforts to contain and conceal her have been met with resistance from various groups claiming to be her allies. These groups have been investigated and monitored, and any information obtained has been added to the SCP-8835 file.
