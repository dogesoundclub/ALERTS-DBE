Item #: SCP-8243

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8243 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to electronic devices is strictly prohibited, and all gifts must be pre-approved by at least two Level 3 personnel before being given to SCP-8243.

Description: SCP-8243 appears to be a humanoid male of the Homo sapiens species, identified as a programmer. Its most notable features include a dark spot around its mouth and a pair of nerd glasses covering its eyes. SCP-8243 also wears a head accessory resembling a doge hat and has a two-color band on its forehead. A single gold earring is located on each ear, and it is commonly seen wearing a red scarf around its neck. In addition, SCP-8243 often carries a candy stick as a secondary accessory.

SCP-8243's anomalous trait is its exceptional gift-giving ability. Its highly observant and detail-oriented personality allows it to identify the perfect gift for any occasion, making it a valuable asset to Foundation staff during gift exchanges. However, SCP-8243's obsession with finding the "perfect" gift can lead to extended periods of distress, causing potential harm to its mental well-being.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8243's exceptional abilities, it has been granted limited access to electronic devices for programming purposes. However, all devices must be thoroughly inspected for any hidden gifts or alterations before being issued to SCP-8243. Failure to comply with these procedures may result in severe consequences.
