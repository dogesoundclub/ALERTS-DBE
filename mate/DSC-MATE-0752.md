Item #: DSC-MATE-752

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-752 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-752 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and any interaction with DSC-MATE-752 must be monitored at all times.

DSC-MATE-752 is to be given any necessary legal documents and materials for their work as a lawyer, but all outgoing communication must be reviewed and approved by Foundation personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-752 is a human male with spotted skin and a distinctive two-color band across their forehead. They wear a medical mask over their mouth, and a pair of goggles on their forehead. DSC-MATE-752 also wears a green cross earring on their right ear, and a red scarf as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-752 is known to have a scatterbrained and forgetful personality, often forgetting appointments or getting lost while trying to find a new place. Despite this, DSC-MATE-752 is a skilled lawyer, able to argue convincingly and craft legal documents with ease.

DSC-MATE-752's abilities have raised suspicion among Foundation personnel, as they seem to possess knowledge and understanding beyond that of a typical human. Further investigation into DSC-MATE-752's origins and capabilities is ongoing.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-752 has not displayed any anomalous abilities or behavior to date, but caution is advised when interacting with them. As with all humanoid DSCs, continued observation and careful monitoring are essential to prevent any potential breaches or incidents.
