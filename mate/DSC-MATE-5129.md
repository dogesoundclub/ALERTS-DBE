Item #: DSC-MATE-5129

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5129 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with additional precautions taken to ensure their safety and the safety of others. All staff interacting with DSC-MATE-5129 are to wear protective gear to prevent accidental infection of DSC-MATE-5129's primary anomaly.

DSC-MATE-5129 is to be monitored at all times for any shifts in behavior or abilities. Any changes are to be reported to the supervising officer immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-5129 is a human male police officer, identified as Officer ██████, who displays several anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-5129's face is adorned with orange stripes and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-5129's head is covered in green hair, accompanied by a purple cap. DSC-MATE-5129's ears feature a gold earring, and DSC-MATE-5129 can often be seen wearing a medical mask and red scarf.

DSC-MATE-5129 displays a set of behavior patterns consistent with a love of tradition, alongside a no-nonsense attitude when handling protocol. Additional research shows that DSC-MATE-5129 has a playful side and often uses jokes and family stories to connect with others.

It is also known that DSC-MATE-5129 creates a significant shift in the immediate area when triggered. DSC-MATE-5129's anomalous effect creates a feeling of danger and emergency response, leading to a sense of urgency and the need to act quickly.

Upon initial containment, DSC-MATE-5129 was found to have the ability to create and manipulate fire, causing severe damage to the testing chamber. Since then, DSC-MATE-5129 has been observed to lose this ability and instead demonstrates a resistant temperament against cold temperatures and the capacity to perceive and interact with angry spirits.

DSC-MATE-5129's psychometric capacity has affected its ability to follow safety protocols consistently, making containment challenging. As such, research into DSC-MATE-5129's condition and its potential application in aiding the Foundation in containing other humanoid anomalies is ongoing.

Addendum: Due to his proclivity to handle things "by the book, some Foundation researchers find mentoring DSC-MATE-5129 to be the most efficient and effective method of handling DSC-MATE-5129.
