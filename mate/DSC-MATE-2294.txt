Item #: SCP-2294

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2294 is to be confined to an urban area and is not to leave it at any given point. All social events and interactions with the public must be monitored by security personnel, and any unusual behavior must be reported immediately. SCP-2294's movements and actions must be closely watched, and any indication of danger or threat to society must be brought to the attention of the Site Director.

Description: SCP-2294 is a female human politician with orange stripes on her face and an orange eyebrow. She has a smile on her face, wears a medical mask, and a green cross earring. She also sports a "00s school girl" hairstyle and a choker accessory around her neck.

Personality-wise, SCP-2294 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards her political career. However, her social behavior is unusual in the sense that she knows how to let loose and have fun, often surprising people with her dance moves and silly antics. Despite her strange behavior, SCP-2294 is capable of socializing at high-class events for political purposes, where she is observed to be a competent and well-spoken individual.

She has no anomalous effects on individuals she meets or interacts with, and so far, there is no evidence to suggest that SCP-2294 is a threat to society. However, as with all anomalous beings, SCP-2294 must be closely monitored for any changes in behavior or activity. Any deviation or sign of danger must be brought to the attention of the Site Director as soon as possible.

Addendum: SCP-2294 has requested access to some of the Foundation's advanced technologies to help with their political career. The request is currently pending review, and a decision will be made in due course.
