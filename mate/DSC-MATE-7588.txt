Item #: 7588

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7588 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with an additional audio and visual monitoring system. SCP-7588's cell is to be kept clean with additional ventilation to accommodate for SCP-7588's musky smell.

SCP-7588 is to be provided with an electrical toolkit to keep their electrician skills honed. Accessory #2, cigarettes, is not to be provided to SCP-7588 under any circumstance.

SCP-7588 is not allowed to be in proximity to other SCPs, as they seem to have an uncanny ability to sense emotions and predict events. In case of emergency, SCP-7588 is to be escorted to the nearest safe room until the incident is resolved.

Description: SCP-7588 is a male rabbit, approximately 50cm in height and weighing 9kg. SCP-7588 has red clown eyes and wears a distinctive bucket hat. SCP-7588's forehead features a red victory band, and they wear a jade earring. Additionally, they sport a red scarf.

SCP-7588's electrician skills are excellent, but they seem to have secondary abilities as they can predict events before they happen or sense emotions in other creatures.

SCP-7588's personality may make it difficult to communicate, and the eerie feeling they give off makes human interaction difficult. SCP-7588's intuition makes them an excellent candidate for predicting potential threats and events before they occur.

SCP-7588 seems to have a habit of smoking cigarettes, which is not a healthy habit for it or the surrounding humans.

Addendum: SCP-7588 has shown signs of distress and agitation when it detects extreme negative emotions. Further research is required to understand the full extent of SCP-7588's abilities.
