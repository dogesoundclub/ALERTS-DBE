SCP-7158, codenamed "The Clown Banker," is a humanoid entity posing as a banker. Their physical appearance is highly unusual, with orange stripes across their face which contrasts with their green head and red clown eyes. Adding to their eccentric look are gold earrings and a choker, reflecting a personal taste for adornments. 

Although SCP-7158 appears to be human, their peculiar face sculpt suggests a more complex origin. Attempts to decipher its species have been inconclusive. SCP-7158's personality is characterized by a strict adherence to tradition while maintaining a humorous side. They are known to frequently recite jokes and stories passed down through their family and community, creating light moments for those around them. 

SCP-7158's true nature and agenda remain unknown; however, the Foundation suspects that they may possess anomalous abilities that allow them to manipulate and influence those around them. It is unclear how many other entities like SCP-7158 exist, and the Foundation advises all personnel to exercise caution and avoid interacting with them outside of necessary containment procedures.
