Item #: 2899
Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 2899 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell as per protocol. Due to her profession, 2899 is allowed use of her cellular device, laptop and personal assistant within her cell. Interaction with 2899 should be minimal, limited to her assigned lawyer and any legal consultation she may require.

Description: DSC-MATE-2899 is a human female in her late twenties with a height of 175cm and weight of 70kg. She has dark spots on her face, most notably around her nose and cheeks. DSC-MATE-2899 has full, red lips and wears normal glasses. She constantly wears a purple cap with a headset over her head, a two-color band on her forehead, and a red cross earring on her left ear. Her choice of accessory is a normal gas mask often worn while outside her containment cell.

DSC-MATE-2899 has a very analytical and logical personality; her nature leads her to enjoy arguing and debating with others. While these arguments can lean towards ridiculous or unimportant topics, they form a part of her day to day routine.

DSC-MATE-2899's claim to fame is her success rate as a lawyer, where she had an unbeaten record of 98% at the time of containment. Due to her analytical nature and sharp mind, it is not uncommon for her to look for loopholes and technicalities when representing clients.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2899 was apprehended during a hearing when she openly challenged the laws, by exploiting a legal loophole in the prosecution's argument. It is still under investigation whether DSC-MATE-2899 had come into contact with anomalous objects and beings. DSC-MATE-2899 has, since containment, expressed explicit interest in "working" with the Foundation, offering legal consultation for captured anomalies. Her offer has been denied until further review.
