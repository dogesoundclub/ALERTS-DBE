Item #: 1969

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1969 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with the added provision of a train simulator. SCP-1969 must be allowed to operate the simulator once every week, for a period no longer than three hours.

Description: SCP-1969 is a juvenile male rabbit, wearing a police cap and a silver chain around his neck, with a lit cigarette in his mouth. SCP-1969's most notable feature is his LED-lit, VR-compatible eyes, which flash and rotate according to SCP-1969's emotional state.

SCP-1969's personality is ambitious and goal-oriented, with exceptional organizational and strategic thinking abilities. It is noted that SCP-1969's ambitions can sometimes exceed his capabilities, and he tends to take on more challenges than he can handle. However, despite this, SCP-1969 usually manages to overcome obstacles and emerge successful.

SCP-1969's preferred occupation is that of a train driver, and he has shown a marked proficiency in simulation-based train driving activities. SCP-1969 is known to become increasingly distressed when not allowed to operate a train simulator, causing an increase in his anxiety and stress levels.

SCP-1969's jade earring has been noted as an anomaly within his makeup, but its precise nature has not yet been ascertained.

Addendum: After several successful trials, SCP-1969 was granted permission to operate a full-scale train simulator for an extended period. Due to its extensive anomalous abilities and excellent train driving skills, SCP-1969 has become a valuable asset to the SCP Foundation's transportation logistics.
