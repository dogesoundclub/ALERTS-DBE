Item #: SCP-7367

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7367 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. SCP-7367 is allowed to retain her position as a theater manager, however, all employees under her are to be selected by Foundation personnel to ensure their safety. SCP-7367 is not to be allowed access to any non-medical mask.

Description: SCP-7367 is a female human with distinctive facial features including orange stripes, blue clown eyes, and a large smile. SCP-7367's head is blonde but features a single wing protruding from the right side. She wears a medical mask over her mouth obscuring any further facial features. SCP-7367's forehead features a goggle on a headband and she wears a choker around her neck. A single green cross earring adorns her left ear.

SCP-7367's personality is characterized by introspection and daydreaming. This has led to instances where SCP-7367 has accidentally injured herself while lost in thought. Foundation personnel are advised to monitor SCP-7367 closely during classified operations.

SCP-7367 was discovered by Foundation personnel after reports of strange occurrences at the theater she managed were received. Inspection of the premises revealed that SCP-7367 had used anomalous practices to influence audience members, causing them to behave erratically.

SCP-7367 was neutralized and brought into Foundation custody. Further investigation revealed that she had created her appearance and abilities through exposure to unknown anomalous objects, leading researchers to classify her as Euclid.

Further testing is to be conducted to determine the full extent of SCP-7367's powers and the potential for their removal.
