Description: SCP-6615 is a male human who appears to be quite ordinary, except for the orange stripes running across its face. SCP-6615's most notable feature is its eyes, which are VR Jade LED displaying various information, including its thoughts and emotions. Its head is parted pink, and it has jade earrings on its ears. SCP-6615 is usually seen wearing a medical mask.

SCP-6615 is a veterinarian and has extensive knowledge of animals and their behavior. However, it also has a thirst for knowledge and spends a lot of time reading or researching obscure topics. SCP-6615 enjoys collecting books, documentaries, or other educational materials, and can be quite passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with others. SCP-6615's extensive knowledge and curiosity make it a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in cases involving anomalous creatures.

SCP-6615's jade LED eyes allow it to communicate non-verbally, making it an excellent communicator with other SCPs and Foundation personnel. However, SCP-6615's curiosity can sometimes lead it to disobey direct orders and explore dangerous areas or interact with other SCPs, which puts it at risk of being affected by anomalous properties.

SCP-6615's medical knowledge is also useful for treating Foundation personnel and non-anomalous animals. However, its curiosity can sometimes lead to experimentation with anomalous creatures, which could result in dangerous consequences.

SCP-6615 has a friendly demeanor and a smile on its face, which can put others at ease. However, its motives and actions should be closely monitored due to its curiosity and potential risks to its own safety and the safety of others.
