Item #: 7212

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7212 is to be regularly monitored and observed when in contact with financial assets.

Description: SCP-7212 appears to be a human female in her late 20s-early 30s, with red lips and orange eyebrows. She has blonde hair that is often seen in an ushanka, and a double-color band on her forehead. She wears a medical mask over her mouth and has been seen wearing a green cross earring on both ears. SCP-7212 always sports a gold chain, which seems to be of sentimental value to her.

SCP-7212 is a bank employee with an exceptional imagination and unique interests that can range from writing poetry to creating cosplay costumes. This often leads her to collect and hoard unusual objects, which she believes to be of great value. SCP-7212's vivid imagination can also lead to her being easily distracted, which is why she needs to be strictly monitored at all times.

SCP-7212's situation is unique, as her interests make her a valuable asset to the Foundation. She has been deemed a Safe-class SCP, as long as she is kept away from any anomalous artifacts. Any objects she comes into contact with are to be checked thoroughly and immediately removed if deemed anomalous. SCP-7212's ability to acquire and use financial assets makes her a valuable tool in the Foundation's arsenal against anomalous threats.

Addendum: SCP-7212 has expressed a strong interest in creating a budgeting program for the Foundation, which has been approved by the Ethics Committee for further review. She shows great organizational skills that could prove to be a useful tool for the Foundation's future endeavors.
