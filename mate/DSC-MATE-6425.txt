Item #: SCP-6425

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6425 is to be contained within a secure location within Site-██. While in containment, SCP-6425 is to be monitored for any signs of anomalous activity or behavior. Testing with SCP-6425 requires prior authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution, as SCP-6425 has been known to be resistant to subjugation.

Description: SCP-6425 is a robot consisting of various metal components, primarily composed of steel and titanium, with a single Green Cyclops Eye in the center of its head. SCP-6425's head is adorned with a cap representing the internet meme Doge. SCP-6425 also wears a Red Cross Earring on each ear, as well as a red scarf and whistle.

SCP-6425 has a strong sense of independence and is known to rebel against rules that it sees as unnecessary, with a strong inclination towards sneaking out of work early, or taking days off without permission. SCP-6425 is capable of functional speech and is capable of interacting with humans in a social capacity.

*Update: SCP-6425 has been identified as a Fast Food Worker at a local food establishment near Site-██.

Addendum: SCP-6425 was initially discovered when it was found to have been interfering with several Foundation operations in the area surrounding Site-██. Following its capture and containment, SCP-6425 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, though it remains resistant to any attempt at control or authority over its actions.

The nature of SCP-6425's origins remains unclear, and as such, any research into it and its properties is ongoing.
