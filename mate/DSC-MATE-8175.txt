Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8175 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. Access to SCP-8175 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. SCP-8175 is allowed to continue practicing their career as a fashion designer, as long as no designs show any anomalous properties or use of SCP objects. Additionally, all models for SCP-8175's fashion shows must undergo a thorough background check before participating.

Description: SCP-8175 is a human male of average height and weight, with a distinct spotted pattern on their face. SCP-8175 is frequently seen wearing a green headpiece and a jade earring on their right ear. SCP-8175 is often seen wearing a red scarf and a standard gas mask despite not having respiratory issues. SCP-8175 exhibits a natural charisma and charm that can affect those in close proximity, often drawing attention to themselves through humorous situations or jokes.

SCP-8175 has shown no anomalous abilities, as their anomalous status is solely a result of their appearance and effect on others. However, due to SCP-8175's career as a fashion designer, they have access to fashion items that could potentially be anomalous. Therefore, it is important to monitor all fashion designs created by SCP-8175 for potential anomalies.

Personality: SCP-8175 is an outgoing and charming individual, known for being the life of the party. SCP-8175 has a quick wit and often uses humor to diffuse tense situations or to make others laugh. SCP-8175 is dedicated to their work as a fashion designer and has shown a passion for using clothing to express themselves.

Addendum: SCP-8175 was brought to the Foundation's attention after a series of fashion shows featuring designs with anomalous properties. SCP-8175 claimed no knowledge of any anomalous properties and was cooperative with Foundation personnel during questioning. SCP-8175 has since aided the Foundation in identifying potential SCP-related fashion items in the fashion industry.
