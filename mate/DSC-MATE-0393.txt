Item #: 393 

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-393 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with standard amenities, including a bed and bathroom facilities. All personnel are required to wear personal protective equipment that covers the mouth and nose when interacting with SCP-393. 

SCP-393 is allowed to perform maintenance duties within Site-██, provided that they are closely monitored by security personnel at all times. SCP-393 may not be given access to any sensitive areas or information. 

Description: SCP-393 is a human female of average height and weight, with distinctive facial features. Their face is marked with orange stripes, and they wear red lipstick. SCP-393's eyes are blue, with a makeup design that resembles that of a clown. SCP-393 has short, witch-like hair and wears a medical mask over their mouth. 

On their forehead, SCP-393 has a two-color band and goggles that are affixed in place. They wear a red cross earring on each ear and a choker around their neck. 

SCP-393 is known for their charismatic personality and their ability to connect with others on a deep level. They excel at getting strangers to open up and share their life stories, often creating humorous situations that bring people closer together. 

Despite their friendly demeanor, SCP-393 should not be underestimated. They possess a keen intellect and a strong sense of self-preservation. SCP-393 has demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt to new situations and can be resourceful when necessary. 

SCP-393's previous occupation was as an electrician, and they have been known to use these skills to manipulate electrical systems. This presents a potential security risk and has prompted the restriction of SCP-393's access to sensitive areas. 

Addendum: SCP-393 has requested that they be referred to by their chosen name, "Sparky." While not standard procedure, granting this request has been deemed acceptable by personnel.
