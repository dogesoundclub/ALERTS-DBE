Item #: SCP-1254

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1254 is to be contained in a secure facility equipped with Class D robots trained in the handling and maintenance of mechanical beings. SCP-1254's programming is to be consistently monitored for any signs of malfunction or deviation from standard procedures. Personnel are reminded to keep in mind SCP-1254's controlling tendencies and to approach with caution when cooperating in group situations.

Description: SCP-1254 is a traffic officer robot, measuring 5 ft 11 in height and weighing approximately 300 lbs. Its outer shell is made of a durable, steel material adorned with various minor damages and scratches consistent with heavy usage. SCP-1254's head consists of a retro cap with a green cyclops eye in the center and a set of horned rim glasses covering the eyepiece. A medical mask is attached to its mouth, shielding its mechanical inner workings. A goggle is present on SCP-1254's forehead as an additional accessory. It also wears a gold chain necklace for aesthetic purposes.

SCP-1254's programming is designed to be very organized and efficient, which can sometimes lead to controlling tendencies. It is capable of delegating tasks with a matter-of-fact attitude and can come across as humorous in group projects. Despite its authoritarian nature, SCP-1254 complies with utmost professionalism and dedication.

Addendum: SCP-1254's most recent evaluation revealed slight deviations in its programming. Despite complying with standard protocols, it has displayed sudden bouts of autonomy, such as refusing an officer in distress's request to call for backup. Further research is necessary to determine if SCP-1254's autonomy is intentional or a product of a malfunction.
