DogeSoundClub Character Description:

Identification number 3542 is a human male who holds the role of Traffic Officer. His appearance is striking, with orange stripes across his face, a bright smile, and piercing red clown eyes. He wears a red victory band on his forehead and always has goggles resting atop his head. A gold earring catches the light as he moves, and a vibrant red scarf wraps around his neck. He can often be seen with a cigarette held between his fingers.

His personality is as unique as his appearance. With a creative and vivid imagination, he takes pleasure in uncommon hobbies and interests such as writing poetry, putting together intricate cosplay costumes, or collecting exotic objects. While he may appear eccentric to some, his sharp mind and attention to detail make him a valuable asset to the foundation. His excellent record speaks for itself, and he takes his duty as a Traffic Officer seriously. However, his playful nature can sometimes lead to inappropriate behavior and contemplation of actions that are not in line with DSC ethics. Despite this, he remains an important member of our team.
