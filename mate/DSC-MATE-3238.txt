Item #: SCP-3238

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3238 is to be monitored at all times by a team of trained personnel. Any unusual behavior or activity is to be reported to the site director immediately. SCP-3238's veterinarian practice is to be closely monitored and all potential patients are to be screened before entry. SCP-3238 is to be provided with a large enclosure resembling their natural habitat, including a running stream to swim in.

Description: SCP-3238 appears to be a male tiger, standing at approximately 2.5 meters tall and weighing 309 kilograms. Their most striking feature is their blue clown eyes, which are unsettling to those who look into them for extended periods of time. SCP-3238 is often seen wearing a bucket hat, with a two-color band around their forehead and a red cross earring on each ear. They frequently wear a medical mask over their mouth, possibly as a precaution for infectious diseases.

SCP-3238's personality is caring and nurturing, often treating their friends and family members like their own children. However, they are still a wild animal and can become aggressive if provoked or threatened. SCP-3238 has shown a strong affinity for treating and caring for other animals, particularly domestic animals.

Addendum: SCP-3238 was discovered in a veterinarian clinic in [REDACTED], where they had been successfully treating animal patients for several years without incident. All veterinary staff and animal patients from the clinic have been given Class A amnestics and released. SCP-3238 is currently under close observation and study to determine the extent of their abilities and any potential risks they may pose.
