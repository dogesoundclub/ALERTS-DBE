Item #: 1775

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1775 is to be kept in a large containment chamber with plenty of room for movement. The walls should be padded to prevent injury. Subject 1775 should be given regular access to fresh vegetables and water. No physical contact is allowed with subject 1775.

Description: Subject 1775 is a rabbit of the male sex with a frightened mouth, often seen trembling even when not afraid. The subject wears a distinct Doge hat on his head and nerd glasses on his eyes. A gold earring can be seen on each ear, and a red scarf complements his attire.

While subject 1775 may seem harmless at first glance, it is noted that the rabbit's ability to entertain others with his sense of humor poses a formidable threat. Laughter has been known to attract a wide range of paranormal entities, with some cases resulting in destruction and mayhem.

The Foundation has observed that subject 1775 enjoys telling funny stories and doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. In some cases, subject 1775 has used humor to pacify hostile entities and lessen the severity of tense situations.

However, it is imperative to note that subject 1775 is not to be underestimated. It is strongly advised that all personnel maintain a professional demeanor at all times around the rabbit and not engage subject 1775 in any frivolous activities.

Addendum: A recent study has shown that subject 1775's humor is more effective in controlling paranormal entities when combined with a specific incantation. The Foundation is currently conducting further research into the matter.
