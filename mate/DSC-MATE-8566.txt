Item #: SCP-8566

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8566 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to their occupation as a firefighter, SCP-8566 is permitted to carry one box of cigarettes on their person at all times. Any use of cigarettes is to be monitored and limited.

Description: SCP-8566 is a male human with distinctive facial features. They have orange stripes running down both cheeks, and their eyes are permanently fixed to resemble those of a clown, with irises appearing red. SCP-8566 is usually seen wearing a red beanie on their head, with a two-color band on their forehead. It is believed that these features are the result of an unidentified anomalous effect.

SCP-8566 presents as an outgoing and charismatic individual, often using their natural charm to entertain others. They have a propensity for humor and are known to tell jokes and perform silly dances in order to make others laugh. SCP-8566 is often found smoking cigarettes during periods of stress or anxiety, and seems to have an addiction to nicotine.

SCP-8566 was first brought to the attention of the Foundation following reports of unusual occurrences at multiple fire scenes. Witnesses reported seeing SCP-8566 exhibiting anomalous abilities in the control of fire, including being able to manipulate its direction and intensity. Further investigation revealed SCP-8566's unique features and led to their containment by the Foundation.

Addendum: Due to the potential danger posed by SCP-8566's anomalous abilities, it has been determined that any use of them is to be strictly monitored and limited. SCP-8566 will remain in containment at Site-██ until a complete understanding of their anomalous properties can be achieved.
