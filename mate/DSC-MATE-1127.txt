Item #: SCP-1127

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1127 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with reinforced walls and a secure door. The cell is to be equipped with a high-tech security system with multiple cameras for constant monitoring. Any attempts to remove or damage the silver chain or LED gas mask are to be met with appropriate force.

Description: SCP-1127 appears to be a human male with orange stripes on his face and a perpetual smile. His eyes are blue clown eyes, which appear to glow in the dark. SCP-1127 wears a short peak cap on his head and a green cross earring on each ear. He is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck and an LED gas mask over his face, which he claims helps him "breathe easier."

SCP-1127 possesses a strong sense of independence that can sometimes manifest as rebellious behavior. He has been known to disobey authority and break rules he deems unnecessary, often sneaking out of his job as a security guard early without permission. Despite his mischievous tendencies, SCP-1127 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel and has not exhibited any violent tendencies.

Addendum: SCP-1127 has expressed a desire to "see the world" and has requested permission to leave the containment cell on occasion. This request is currently under review by on-site personnel.
