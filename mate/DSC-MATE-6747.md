Item #: DSC-MATE-6747

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6747 is to be allowed to continue its previous occupation as a delivery driver under close observation. Due to its self-contained demeanor, direct communication should be kept to a minimum. A D-class operative should be assigned to ride along with DSC-MATE-6747's daily routes to ensure that no anomalous activity occurs. DSC-MATE-6747 is to be monitored for any signs of detrimental activity towards itself, the items within its possession, or any other person or object.

DSC-MATE-6747's head is an iridescent metal blue. DSC-MATE-6747's glasses appear to be standard prescription glasses, with no anomalous properties noted.

DSC-MATE-6747 is characterized as a highly empathetic individual with a tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, including its mode of transportation, household appliances, and plants. DSC-MATE-6747 displays an exceptional level of care and nurturing towards said items, often giving them unique names and conversing with them as if they are sentient beings with thoughts and feelings.

Addendum 6747-A: Observation logs indicate that DSC-MATE-6747 displays no overt signs of anomalous activity. However, an incident report filed on ██/██/20██ highlights an occurrence where DSC-MATE-6747's vehicle was found to have a mind of its own. DSC-MATE-6747 reported that her vehicle had driven her to a location far beyond her intended route before returning her safely to her place of residence.

It is recommended that future observation logs focus on DSC-MATE-6747's potential connection to this occurrence.

Addendum 6747-B: DSC-MATE-6747 has made requests to transport living creatures such as plants and insects in its vehicle. Due to the unknown effects this could have on both DSC-MATE-6747 and the organisms, this request is currently under review.

Further observation is required to ascertain whether or not DSC-MATE-6747's inclination towards the care of other objects extends to living beings.
