Item #: 4795

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4795 is to be monitored as per standard protocol for all known sapient entities. Any unusual behavior should be recorded in detail, and any manifestations of anomalous abilities are to be reported immediately to Site Security. SCP-4795 is currently contained within an urban environment, and should be allowed to continue with its normal daily routine of being a news anchor.

Description: SCP-4795 is a male humanoid entity with the physical features of a rabbit. Its eyes are concealed behind normal glasses, and it wears a hooded sweatshirt and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-4795 is often seen carrying a candy stick, which has not yet been determined to have anomalous properties.

SCP-4795 possesses an unusual ability to sense the emotions of others, and is particularly adept at being able to discern when individuals are experiencing negative emotions such as sadness or anger. It is unknown at this time how the entity is able to perform this feat, and more research is required to understand the extent of its abilities.

SCP-4795 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, and has so far shown no signs of aggression or intent to harm. However, due to its anomalous nature, SCP-4795 remains an object of concern, and should be monitored closely for any unusual behavior. 

Addendum: SCP-4795 has been particularly useful in diffusing difficult situations involving other SCPs, and should be utilized as such when deemed necessary by Foundation personnel.
