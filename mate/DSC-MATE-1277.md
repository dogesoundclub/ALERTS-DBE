Item #: 1277

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1277 is to be contained within a maximum-security prison and monitored at all times. No interaction, communication or information exchange of any kind is allowed to be made between the subject and personnel unless authorized by O5 Council members. All personnel that have contact with 1277 must wear reflective body armor and observation must be made through remotely controlled camera.

Description: DSC-MATE-1277 is a female human of Caucasian ethnicity, with the persistence of identifying as the head of an organized crime group known as the "Clown Mafia." It possesses a unique characteristic with red clown eyes which are capable of forcing a hypnotic trance on those it makes eye contact with, enabling the subject to suggest and control their actions. Object's tiara on top of their head and green cross earring on both ears both appear to lend it powers that grant its wishes. 1277 tends to enjoy a frivolous and entertaining performance, frequently taking pleasure in being the center of attention.

Personnel interacting with 1277 report feeling a compelling urge to please, and often go to great lengths to ensure they are deemed excellent in DSC-MATE-1277's gaze. It has been noted that 1277 shirks practicality and follows the benefits of its whims, even though this has resulted in most disastrous situations for itself and others.

DSC-MATE-1277 has used anomalous abilities to influence and control the inter-city drug trade, perform large-scale theft, and overcome local law enforcement. Several Foundation MTF reports have been submitted to do covert operations to terminate 1277, but all missions have failed so far.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1277's glowing eyes have been observed to grow brighter when it is angry, and it is recommended to avoid this situation entirely to prevent any catastrophic consequences.
