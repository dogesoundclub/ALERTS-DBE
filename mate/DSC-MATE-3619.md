Document #: DSC-MATE-3619

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3619 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, revised for their unique characteristics. The cell must be equipped with a full-spectrum lighting system, as well as soundproofing materials to minimize external stimulus. All communication with DSC-MATE-3619 must be conducted in a professional and respectful manner to prevent potential outbursts.

DSC-MATE-3619 is to be provided with a news casting studio upon request, located within the containment facility. Any and all recordings made by DSC-MATE-3619 must be reviewed and approved by site administrators before broadcasting.

Description: DSC-MATE-3619 is a human male news anchor, standing at 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 76 kilograms. The subject's most notable feature is their red clown eyes, which have shown no adverse effects on DSC-MATE-3619's vision.

DSC-MATE-3619's face is typically adorned with a smile, though such expressions are suspected to be part of an anomalous compulsion rather than actual joy. The subject's hair is parted and dyed pink, and a pair of goggles rests on their forehead at all times.

DSC-MATE-3619 wears a single green cross earring and a gold chain. The subject's outfit changes daily and is always the latest fashion trends. DSC-MATE-3619's speech is broadcast-quality, however, they tend to be very introspective and may spend a lot of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

DSC-MATE-3619 is capable of anomalous vocal projection capable of inciting hysteria in surrounding individuals. The effect only seems to occur in live broadcasts and not during recordings.

Addendum: During a containment breach in Site-██, DSC-MATE-3619 was found broadcasting within the site, causing nearby personnel to riot. Class C amnestics were administered to all witnesses, and DSC-MATE-3619 was re-contained without incident. Further testing is necessary to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-3619's anomalous effects.
