SCP-7074, designated as "The Hare of Arcane Beauty," is a unique and enigmatic creature hiding among us. Possessing the appearance of an ordinary rabbit, SCP-7074 stands out with its striking red clown eyes that sparkle with an otherworldly glint, and its jade earring that dangles from its otherwise unremarkable ears. When not wowing clients with their beauty treatments, SCP-7074 spends their time exploring the city and pursuing their insatiable appetite for knowledge.

Despite appearing like a cute and harmless animal, SCP-7074's deep curiosity about the world can lead to unpredictable and even dangerous situations. They possess a keen intellect and exceptional memory that enable them to easily remember an array of obscure and arcane facts, which they frequently recite to others, even if unasked. Under their influence, bystanders have been observed to experience headaches, confusion, and sometimes even temporary loss of consciousness.

Fortunately, SCP-7074's interest in knowledge is not purely self-serving. They exhibit a genuine desire to connect with others and are often eager to share their wisdom for the betterment of society. However, extreme caution is still advised when interacting with SCP-7074, as their knowledge and abilities may be too powerful for the average human mind to handle.

SCP-7074 is known to adorn themselves with a gold chain, which is believed to increase their natural charm and glamour when interacting with clients. Discovery of SCP-7074's abilities has raised concerns about the true nature of beauty in our society, and efforts are underway to better understand this remarkable creature and their impact on our world.
