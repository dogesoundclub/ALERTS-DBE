Item #: DSC-MATE-9614

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9614 is to be kept in a standard rabbit containment chamber adorned with posters of theatrical productions in which it has been previously involved. The chamber is to be fitted with a headset which enables DSC-MATE-9614 to manage the theater's technical aspects.

DSC-MATE-9614 is not to be removed from the chamber without approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. All personnel who interact with DSC-MATE-9614 are advised to approach it with caution due to its propensity for absent-mindedness.

Description: DSC-MATE-9614 is a male rabbit identified by the 2 color band on its forehead. It wears a purple cap with a headset over its blue clown eyes, which allows it to control the audio and visual aspects of theatrical productions.

DSC-MATE-9614 is often seen with a frightened mouth expression and a jade earring in one ear. It also sports a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-9614's personality is one often lost in thought and introspection. As a result, it is prone to accidents such as walking into poles or tripping over items in its path. Despite its tendency to be scatterbrained, DSC-MATE-9614 is a capable theater manager, ensuring productions run smoothly and all technical aspects are managed properly.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9614 has expressed a strong desire to participate in musical theater productions. Research is underway to determine if this is feasible and if it poses any risks to the containment of the anomaly.
