Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1251 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All interactions with SCP-1251 must be conducted through a double-layered electrified fence. Anyone entering SCP-1251’s cell must wear gas masks and avoid making direct eye contact. All personnel must undergo intensive psychological evaluations before any contact with SCP-1251.

Description: SCP-1251 is a humanoid male of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 1.85 meters (6'1") tall. SCP-1251 is a mafia boss of the Lucchese crime family. When not wearing his gas mask, SCP-1251 has red clown eyes and a clown mouth. SCP-1251 always wears a short peak cap and silver chain as accessories.

SCP-1251 has a scatterbrained personality, often forgetting important appointments or getting sidetracked easily. SCP-1251 is also known to have a penchant for humor and has been known to tell jokes and pranks on occasion.

SCP-1251's gas mask is its most unique feature. The mask appears to be a custom LED gas mask, with various colored lights constantly changing. The mask will change patterns when SCP-1251 is in different moods or emotional states.

SCP-1251’s voice has a modulated quality, and it is believed that the gas mask is responsible for it. SCP-1251 claims the mask helps alleviate a respiratory ailment.

Addendum: Foundation agents discovered SCP-1251’s existence during an undercover mission. SCP-1251's connections to the Lucchese crime family suggest powerful interests with corresponding implications for containment. SCP-1251's current containment status is still under debate.
