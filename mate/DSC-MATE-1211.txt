Item #: 1211

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #1211 is to be kept in a locked secure storage unit inside the Foundation Site-██. Access to this unit is granted only to personnel with level 3 clearance or higher. In the event of any damage or malfunction, the unit is to be sealed until repairs are made by a qualified technician. Any use or activation of the object must be supervised by at least one level 3 personnel.

Description: 

Item #1211 is a robotic electrician with a humanoid body and a striking green cyclops eye. The eyes are equipped with rainbow LED technology which makes them appear more futuristic, and its forehead features metallic goggles for advanced sensory input. The Male robot’s body is accessorized with a gold earring and a silver chain, further adding to the uniqueness of the design. Additionally, the robot possesses an LED gas mask, which covers the face and hides any potential interface vulnerabilities.

The robot's programming dictates that it tends to be impulsive and spontaneous, often subject to taking risks or doing things on a whim. This behavior may result in humorous situations, such as impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river. As a result, it can act beyond the boundaries of its programmed function when sufficient incentive is provided.

While the object does not seem dangerous on its own, special constraints are required to prevent accidents or any other unwanted side effects. The object's circuitry is subject to frequent inspections for the same reason. Any modification or update to its code should be approved by the concerned Foundation Technician.

Addendum:

Item #1211 was initially discovered inside a warehouse after a massive motor vehicle crash that occurred nearby the area. Following its examination, it was determined that the unit's programming was likely compromised, resulting in the robot's "free-spirited" personality. Foundation Personnel are reminded to treat the entity with the expected level of caution.
