Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3083 is to be monitored at all times and is to be contained within Site-██. SCP-3083's access to civilian social media platforms is entirely restricted. SCP-3083 is not to leave its designated work zone unless explicitly authorized by Site personnel. Additionally, any civilians who come in contact with SCP-3083 on duty must have their memories modified.

Description: SCP-3083 is a human male of average height and build with several notable physical features. SCP-3083 is typically seen wearing a traffic officer uniform while on duty. SCP-3083's face features orange stripes on their skin, and they wear normal glasses over their eyes. SCP-3083 has a unique two-color band on their forehead and wears a gold earring in each ear.

SCP-3083's mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and they wear a gold chain as an accessory. SCP-3083's most noteworthy aspect is its personality. SCP-3083 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards its job, but it also knows how to have fun. SCP-3083's light-hearted nature allows them to excel at getting everyone to dance and sing along to their favorite songs, often taking the role of the life of the party.

Addendum: Testing with SCP-3083 has revealed that its personality traits have no unusual effects on its physiology. However, its uncanny ability to entertain and spread joy could be useful in future containment or cover-up displays. As such, we advise studying SCP-3083's phenomenon more closely.
