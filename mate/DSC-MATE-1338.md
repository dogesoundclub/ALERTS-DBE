Item #: 1338

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1338 is to be held in standard humanoid containment at Site-██. Daily psychological evaluations are to be conducted to ensure mental stability. In the event of a containment breach, security personnel are advised to approach with caution, as DSC-MATE-1338 may attempt to take control of the situation.

Description: DSC-MATE-1338 appears to be a human male of Caucasian descent, aged 47. Notable physical features include several dark spots on the face and a smile that appears to be permanent. The subject's eyes are unnaturally bright blue with a pupil resembling that of a clown. DSC-MATE-1338 is often seen wearing a police cap and a goggle on their forehead, as well as a gold earring and a silver chain. The subject frequently smokes cigarettes.

DSC-MATE-1338's most notable attribute is their natural talent for leadership. They have a tendency to take charge in any situation, often assuming a position of authority. Despite their somewhat abrasive personality, DSC-MATE-1338's leadership skills are widely acknowledged by those around them. It is suggested that this ability is linked to the subject's anomalous properties, although this has yet to be fully explored.

DSC-MATE-1338's medical records indicate that they underwent several experimental treatments as a child, which may have contributed to their anomalous abilities. Further investigation is recommended.

Addendum: Dr. ███████, one of DSC-MATE-1338's former colleagues, has stated that the subject's leadership abilities should not be underestimated. "They have a way of getting people to follow them," Dr. ███████ said. "It's almost like a magnetic personality. You find yourself wanting to do what they say, even if it's not something you would normally do." DSC-MATE-1338 continues to be closely monitored.
