Item #: DSC-MATE-8591

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8591 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to his position as a mafia boss, it is imperative that all security protocols are followed when interacting with 8591 for his safety as well as that of Foundation personnel. Any requests made by DSC-MATE-8591 that do not violate Foundation protocols are to be considered and accommodated in order to maintain a cooperative relationship.

Description: DSC-MATE-8591 is a human male with normal blonde hair and a green cross earring on his right ear. He is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck, and carrying a candy stick. His most distinctive facial feature is a frightened mouth. Despite his position as a mafia boss, DSC-MATE-8591 has displayed a very idealistic personality that may be considered atypical for his line of work. He has a strong desire to make the world a better place, which has led to some humorous situations such as protesting or boycotting companies or causes that he feels violate his values.

DSC-MATE-8591 is a well-connected individual with several known ties to criminal organizations across the globe, making him a valuable asset to the Foundation in terms of gathering information on anomalous activity within those circles. However, due to his idealism, DSC-MATE-8591 may periodically act against the Foundation's best interests. As such, all interactions with DSC-MATE-8591 are to be monitored closely.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8591 expressed interest in joining the Foundation in order to use his criminal connections to aid in containment efforts. After a thorough background check and review of potential risks, DSC-MATE-8591 was granted provisional Level 2 clearance and enlisted as a consultant for the Special Containment Procedures Committee. DSC-MATE-8591 has since proven to be a valuable asset in multiple containment operations.
