Item #: SCP-9979

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9979 must be contained within a minimum security humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any equipment required for SCP-9979's job as a beautician must be provided by the Foundation and must be approved by the containment team. SCP-9979 is allowed to perform their job on Foundation personnel on a case-by-case basis only.

Description: SCP-9979 is a female human of unknown age and origin. Their most striking feature is the presence of spots covering their face, along with bright red clown eyes, and purple lips. SCP-9979 is often seen wearing a headset with LED lights and various accessories, including a choker and an LED gas mask.

SCP-9979 is a beautician by trade, with a talent for predicting and sensing things before they happen. This ability can sometimes be eerie and uncomfortable for those around them. SCP-9979 has displayed an aversion to physical touch, which may stem from their abilities to sense and predict the emotions of others.

SCP-9979 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of her predicting natural disasters with great accuracy. Foundation officials approached SCP-9979 for testing and containment shortly after.

Addendum: SCP-9979 has displayed a fondness for performing beauty treatments on Foundation personnel, and has appeared to take great satisfaction in enhancing their physical appearances. However, prolonged exposure to SCP-9979 can have unsettling effects on the psyche of some individuals, and therefore extended interaction is prohibited.
