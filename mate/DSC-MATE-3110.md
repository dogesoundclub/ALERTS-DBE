Special Containment Procedures: 3110 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. She is allowed to have access to her personal belongings and any materials required to maintain her assigned duties as a mechanic.

Description: 3110 is a female human with distinctive spots on her face and purple-colored lips. Her eyes are an unusual blue tone with a clown-like appearance.
