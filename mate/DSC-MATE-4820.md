DogeSoundClub Report - Character 4820

Identification number 4820 is a humanoid robot, known as the "Traffic Officer" among the local populace. This speaking machine has one single, intimidating feature: a green cyclops eye located on the center of its face. The faceplate is made of a high-quality durable metal, and it has a shiny finish that gleams in the sunlight. 4820's eyes are VR jade LED, which can scan anything around them to perceive images in detail.

The character is composed of metallic parts and is a rather strange model of robot, with an Old Western style appearance, complete with boots, clanging bangles, and a red beanie covering the cranial section. The metallic appendages are adorned with an array of dust and scratches, suggesting that 4820 has been around for a while. Around one of the earring holes is a bright green jade earring.
