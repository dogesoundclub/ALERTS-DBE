Item #: 8825

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8825 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell and monitored for any unusual activity. All communication with DSC-MATE-8825 must be conducted through a secure intercom system. Any attempts of unauthorized access to DSC-MATE-8825's containment chamber must be met with immediate termination protocols.

Description: DSC-MATE-8825 is a male robot with green hair covered by a purple cap. DSC-MATE-8825's face features a frightened mouth and wears a pair of nerd glasses. DSC-MATE-8825's ears are adorned with a jade earring, and he carries a silver chain and an LED gas mask as accessories.

DSC-MATE-8825's personality is characterized by its practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving. DSC-MATE-8825 demonstrates a high level of proficiency in repairing broken objects using unconventional methods, such as duct tape and paper clips. DSC-MATE-8825 is a news anchor, and he has the ability to transmit anomalous messages through all telecommunication networks. Such messages have shown to incite panic and anxiety in the general public, prompting the Foundation to restrict DSC-MATE-8825's access to external communication channels.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8825 demonstrated his ability to generate visible light from his LED gas mask by attaching the mask to a broken streetlight. The light's intensity measured at approximately 1 Candela, which is significantly brighter than the original light it was expected to replace. DSC-MATE-8825's ability to generate unlimited supplies of light may prove to be useful in future containment procedures. Further testing is needed to assess the extent of this ability.
