Description: Subject 5634 is an adult male monkey of unknown species. The creature stands around 1.2 meters tall and weighs approximately 50 kilograms. Its body is covered in fur, and its head features a distinctive mohawk on top. The subject often appears frightened, baring his teeth and refusing to make eye contact when spoken to. Its eyes remain unknown due to his tendency to keep them closed.
