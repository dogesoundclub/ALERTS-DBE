Item #: 8476

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-8476 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject should be provided with a minimum of one hour of daily access to the outdoor enclosure in which it may exercise, under the supervision of two armed personnel at all times. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-8476 be allowed prolonged exposure to civilians, particularly those of the legal profession. 

In the event of a site-wide containment breach or incident, it is suggested that any DSC personnel encountering 8476 should offer the subject a candy stick in order to distract and detain it. Under no circumstance should any personnel try to calm or otherwise pacify the subject, due to its unpredictable emotional state.

Description:

DSC-MATE-8476 is a male monkey, described as having blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth. The subject is most often found wearing a retro cap, a jade earring, a gold chain, and carrying a candy stick. Although 8476 is small in size, its behavior and demeanor often inspire laughter in those who encounter it, much to the chagrin of DSC personnel. 

Personnel have reported that DSC-MATE-8476 has an impulsive nature, often acting on its emotions rather than methodical reasoning. This hasty decision-making has been noted to lead to humorous consequences, to the amusement of its observers. 

DSC-MATE-8476's occupation is designated as a lawyer, which has resulted in multiple containment breaches related to the subject's ability to navigate legal loopholes with ease - often resulting in the transfer of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. 

DSC-MATE-8476 is capable of limited conversation, preferring to communicate in monkey-like vocalizations, mixed with occasional human language that it has learned during its previous occupation as a lawyer. Notably, 8476 has a penchant for using legal jargon in its speech, much to the confusion of onlookers.

Addendum: Incident Report ████-██

During a routine physical examination, Dr. ██████ noted that DSC-MATE-8476's age was much older than initially assumed. It is suggested that this will only further increase the subject's cunning and ability to circumvent containment efforts. Procedures have been amended to reflect ongoing analysis of DSC-MATE-8476's physical and mental condition.
