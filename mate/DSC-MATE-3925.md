Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3925 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to any communication devices must be strictly monitored and limited to authorized personnel only.

Description: DSC-MATE-3925 is a human male identified as a reporter. He stands approximately 6’1” tall and weighs 170 lbs. DSC-MATE-3925 has a frightened mouth with ski goggle eyes, a short peak cap on his head, jade earrings in both ears, a silver chain necklace, and a cigarette as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-3925 appears to be a normal human, but his personality varies. They tend to be very introspective and may spend a lot of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought.

DSC-MATE-3925’s job as a reporter is a cover-up for his actual activities, which have been found to involve accessing confidential information and sharing it with unauthorized individuals. DSC-MATE-3925 claims to have no memory of these actions and attributes them to his daydreaming tendencies. Foundation personnel have noted that DSC-MATE-3925’s behavior seems to be genuine, and there is no indication of intentional malice.

DSC-MATE-3925 was brought to the Foundation’s attention after he was caught accessing and illegally distributing classified information from a top-secret government website. Upon investigation, it was revealed that DSC-MATE-3925 had a severe case of dissociative identity disorder.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3925 has been diagnosed and treated for dissociative identity disorder. While he will still be monitored, he has shown significant improvement, and it is anticipated that he will be released from containment soon.
