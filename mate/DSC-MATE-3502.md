Item #: 3502

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3502 is to be monitored at all times while working at her place of employment, a fast food restaurant located in a busy urban area. Any anomalous behavior must be reported immediately to the assigned supervising agent. In case of any manifestation of powers, the subject must be brought for additional testing and containment.

Description: Subject 3502 is a female human in her mid-20s with blue clown eyes, wearing a tiara on her head, red cross earrings, and a choker around her neck. She has an accessory in the form of a cigarette, which is often seen hanging from the corner of her lips. The subject appears to be a normal human, but has displayed an unusually high level of empathy and compassion towards others, which is sometimes accompanied by a minor reality-warping effect.

Personality: 3502 has an overwhelmingly compassionate personality, leading her to always engage in altruistic acts to help others. She seems to have trouble separating her own emotions from those of others, and has a tendency to become overwhelmed with emotion. This empathetic link appears to allow the subject to absorb feelings from those around her, and exert some level of control over their emotions. This ability is often unintentional and uncontrollable, and can lead to spontaneous reality-bending events or anomalies.

Addendum: Despite her anomalous nature, subject 3502 seems to be unaware of her abilities. She appears to view them as a natural part of who she is, rather than a supernatural or abnormal occurrence. Further observation and research is required to understand the full extent of her abilities and potential threats to the general population.
