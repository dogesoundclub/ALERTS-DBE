Item #: SCP-5651

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5651 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with an electrically insulated floor and a Faraday cage to prevent any accidental electrocution. All electrical devices and wiring within SCP-5651's proximity are to be rigorously checked and maintained to avoid electrical surges. SCP-5651's candy stick is to be confiscated during containment to prevent any breaches. Any requests for animal companions must be approved beforehand by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-5651 is a humanoid entity of the male sex, with distinctive orange stripes adorned across their face. SCP-5651's head is composed entirely of a purple metallic substance, the origin and composition of which is not yet understood. SCP-5651 is usually observed wearing a gold chain around their neck and holding a candy stick.

SCP-5651 is a licensed electrician by profession, and is equipped with the ability to generate, manipulate, and store electric energy within their body. SCP-5651 is also able to absorb and conduct electricity from other sources, allowing them to power up electric devices and control electrical signals with ease.

However, SCP-5651's powers have been observed to be directly linked to their emotional state. When SCP-5651 experiences strong empathic responses towards others or animals, their electrical output intensifies, sometimes leading to uncontrolled electrical discharges. SCP-5651 may also display emotional distress or outbursts when witnessing others' pain or suffering.

Despite this unpredictable ability, SCP-5651 is alert, cooperative, and generally regarded as friendly towards staff members. SCP-5651 has shown a particular fondness towards animal companions and has requested permission to keep a pet dog within their chamber.

Addendum: Incident Report 5651-01

On ██/██/20██, during a regular electric maintenance check within SCP-5651's chamber, an electrical surge was observed to have originated from SCP-5651's body, leading to a power outage within Site-██. Investigation revealed that SCP-5651 had been privately mourning the loss of their former pet cat, causing an unusually high level of emotional activity.

Following this incident, all instances of SCP-5651's personal animal companions will be logged and screened for potential risk factors. SCP-5651's request for a pet dog has been approved under strict conditions and continued observation.
