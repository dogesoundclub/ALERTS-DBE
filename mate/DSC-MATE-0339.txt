Item #: SCP-339 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-339 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-339 is granted to Level 3 personnel and above. All interactions with SCP-339 must be recorded and reviewed for irregular behavior. SCP-339 is not allowed to leave the chamber without Level 4 approval. 

Description: SCP-339 is a 31-year-old female human with a unique appearance. Their face is covered in small spots, with bright red lips. The eyes of SCP-339 differ from normal humans as they are replaced with VR Rainbow LED implants that seem to have the ability to display various patterns and colors. SCP-339 often wears a black hoodie, a gold chain, and a LED gas mask as accessories. 

SCP-339 is a licensed medical doctor and is capable of performing medical procedures with great precision. SCP-339 is known to be very empathetic and has a tendency to get emotionally invested in movies, TV shows, music, and art. SCP-339's emotional reactions are often intense and can be observed through their rainbow LED implants, as they light up and flash in response to SCP-339's feelings. SCP-339 claims that the LED implants were added as an experiment on the effects of light and emotions on the human body, although no documentation of such experiment has been found.  SCP-339 seems to enjoy studying the reactions of others to emotional stimuli, and has been known to use movies and music to gauge the emotional responses of others. 

SCP-339's past remains unclear, as they have provided very little information regarding their personal life prior to coming into Foundation custody. Further investigation into the origins of SCP-339 is ongoing. 

Addendum: SCP-339 has requested to be allowed to bring musical instruments into their chamber to use during their free time. The request is currently under review.
