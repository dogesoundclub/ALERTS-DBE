Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8612 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any attempts at unauthorized communication with SCP-8612 are strictly prohibited. Access to SCP-8612 is only granted with Level 3 clearance and above.

Description: SCP-8612 appears to be a humanoid male with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth. However, closer inspection reveals that his eyes are VR Rainbow LED, and his head is not arranged in its natural position, colored in green. A goggle is always seen on his forehead, and a green cross earring is found on his ears. SCP-8612 tends to adorn himself with a silver chain and is commonly seen wearing an LED gas mask.

SCP-8612’s personality is characterized by spontaneity and a love for taking risks. He enjoys doing things impulsively, which can lead to dangerous and potentially humorous situations. It is advised to keep SCP-8612 as calm and relaxed as possible to avoid these situations in the containment chamber.

SCP-8612’s background reveals that he worked as a banker before containment. His family and friends describe him as a risk-taker who often made impulsive decisions. It is unknown how these traits manifested into the appearance and behaviors that SCP-8612 exhibits.

SCP-8612 is incredibly intelligent and has a vast knowledge of finance and economics. He has demonstrated the ability to manipulate financial markets and make risky investments that consistently yield high returns. Despite this, it is imperative to keep SCP-8612 contained due to his unpredictable nature.

Addendum: SCP-8612 has shown a particular interest in the SCP Foundation's financial system. Dr. ██████ has recommended further monitoring and investigation into SCP-8612’s financial abilities and potential impact on the Foundation's finances.
