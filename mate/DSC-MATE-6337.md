Description: DSC-MATE-6337 appears to be a male monkey, with a frightened expression on its face and a hoodie covering its head. DSC-MATE-6337's forehead features two-color bands, and it wears a normal gas mask as an accessory. It is a banker by profession.

DSC-MATE-6337 exhibits rebellious behavior, often sneaking out of the bank or taking days off without permission. It seems to have a strong sense of independence, rejecting any form of authority or rules it deems unnecessary.

DSC-MATE-6337's eyes are currently unknown, as it wears the gas mask at all times. However, its behavior indicates a level of intelligence and awareness beyond that of a normal monkey.

Further research is required to determine if DSC-MATE-6337's behavior is innate or a result of its anomaly. Until then, it is recommended to keep DSC-MATE-6337 under close observation and to limit its contact with outside personnel.
