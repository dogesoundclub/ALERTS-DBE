SCP Foundation Description

SCP-6035, also known as "The Electrician", is a humanoid entity that appears to be a male human of average height and build. He is typically seen wearing normal glasses, a purple cap with green hair, and a green cross earring. A distinctive accessory that he often carries around is a candy stick, which he is known to use as a tool to perform his electrical duties.

SCP-6035's personality is quite unique, being very outgoing and social. His ability to captivate his audience with his humor and wit is a strength that has been known to attract individuals to his company. However, this can also lead to situations where he may become the center of attention, a trait that the Foundation has deemed potentially dangerous due to its ability to trigger anomalous abilities.

SCP-6035's anomalous properties are thus far undocumented but it is believed that his ability to control electricity is beyond that of any normal human. The Foundation is currently conducting in-depth research to fully understand the extent of his abilities and potential threats he poses to himself and others.

All interactions with SCP-6035 are to be conducted through designated Foundation personnel using caution to ensure his safety and containment. In the event of a breach or escape, a prompt notification must be received by the O5 council.

Further testing and research are needed to determine the full extent of SCP-6035's capabilities and threat level.
