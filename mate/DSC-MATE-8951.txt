SCP-8951, also known as "The Hopper", is a humanoid rabbit creature with striking blue clown eyes. It stands at approximately 5'7" and weighs in at an average of 120 pounds. The Hopper is commonly found dressed in a sleek suit and tie, showcasing his professional skills as a car salesman. 

Upon initial examination, SCP-8951 appears to possess a playful and light-hearted demeanor. However, upon further evaluation, it has become evident that this species can be quite stubborn and resistant to change. This reluctance to adapt to new environments and situations has led to multiple humorous instances when The Hopper is presented with unexpected challenges. 

SCP-8951 often accessorizes with a goggle on its forehead, intended to enhance its vision and provide additional protection. The creature also wears a striking jade earring, often drawing attention to its pointed ears. A silver chain can also be found looping around its neck, possibly symbolizing the importance of attention to detail and a sense of refinement.

While The Hopper may come off as charming and reliable, it is important to note its possible aversion to unexpected changes. SCP-8951 should be approached with caution and respect, as to prevent any potential disruptions to its carefully constructed routine.
