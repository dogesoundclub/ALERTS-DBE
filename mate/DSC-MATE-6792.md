Description:
DSC-MATE-6792 is a female human of unknown origins, witnessed with dark spots on her face, and presents an almost constant, disarming smile. Its head is not arranged but seems to have a matching hairstyle with the green dress to be worn on formal events. DSC-MATE-6792 is typically benign, however, psychological testing has revealed a strong sense of independence and rebellious tendencies.

When agitated, DSC-MATE-6792 will lash out in the form of loud, deafening screams. These screams are capable of rupturing eardrums and causing severe auditory hallucinations. DSC-MATE-6792 is also known to have an affinity for large gatherings, like theater events, and will seek to perform managerial duties when left alone for extended periods of time.

DSC-MATE-6792’s choker is not believed to have any anomalous properties at this time, but further testing is required to confirm this hypothesis.
