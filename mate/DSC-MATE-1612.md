DSC-MATE-1612, also known by his human name as "The Clown", is a fast food worker in a local burger joint located in downtown. His species is classified as human, although one look at him may suggest otherwise. DSC-MATE-1612's most notable feature is the various spots on his face, which serve to accentuate his wide, toothy smile. His blue clown eyes are said to be hypnotic, though that is currently unconfirmed by any scientific testing. His hair is a normal blonde color, sitting atop a head that bears the red victory band proudly.

In terms of personality, DSC-MATE-1612 is independent and rebellious, often doing things his own way without regard for authority or structure. This behavior can lead to him taking off work without permission or sneaking out early, which has caused raised eyebrows among his coworkers. Despite this, the Clown maintains a friendly demeanor, always ready with a joke or quip to make others laugh.

It should be noted that although DSC-MATE-1612 may come across as joking and carefree, his origins and abilities remain a mystery to this day. Any attempts to investigate these phenomena have met with resistance or outright refusal from the Clown himself. More research is needed to fully ascertain the nature of this unpredictable subject.
