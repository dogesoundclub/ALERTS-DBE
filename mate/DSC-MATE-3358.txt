SCP-3358, also known as "The Politician", is a peculiar individual with various noticeable characteristics. Firstly, they exhibit small spots on their face, which are a unique feature that immediately sets them apart from others. However, this feature is often hidden behind SCP-3358's wide smile, which never seems to fade away. 

SCP-3358's red clown eyes, although an alarming sight for some individuals, have no known effects on the human mind or body. Moving on to the head, SCP-3358's hair is always unarranged and dyed a bright shade of green. It is noted that they display a preoccupation for their appearance and grooming, and will often include a standard gas mask whenever they go out in public.

To compliment their eccentric look, SCP-3358 wears a gold earring, a silver chain, and is often seen with a brush or canvas in hand. SCP-3358's artistic and creative side is a vital component of their personality. They are heavily invested in various forms of artistic expression, such as painting, drawing, and writing. 

As with other individuals in positions of power, it is essential to monitor SCP-3358's behavior carefully. Any signs of erratic behavior, unusual decision making, or lapses in judgment must be reported immediately to the SCP Foundation.
