SCP-5902 is a primate of the genus simia that has been identified as possessing advanced cognitive abilities and intellect. It works as a veterinarian and is capable of communicating verbally in multiple languages. Its face features a frightened mouth that often complements its witty observations and dry humor. The eyes of SCP-5902 are almost always hidden behind a pair of nerd glasses which help it in analyzing the medical conditions of animals under treatment. The green hair of SCP-5902 is always covered with a purple cap that has become somewhat its signature attire. A two-color band on its forehead is visible when it removes its cap or when its hairline is shifted. SCP-5902 wears a jade earring in its right ear that has no significance other than personal decoration.

In addition to its everyday outfit, SCP-5902 is often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck that has no anomalous properties. However, it is always equipped with a normal gas mask for its own protection, indicating that it may be aware of some anomalous creatures in its surroundings.

SCP-5902 tends to be highly analytical, logical, and practical in its approach to work, but its quirky sense of humor often leads to deadpan teasing of its friends. Its personality is affected by its high intellect and expertise, which sometimes lead to excessive and unnecessary criticism. However, SCP-5902 is cooperative, obedient, and follows orders precisely, traits that make it an outstanding asset to the Foundation.
