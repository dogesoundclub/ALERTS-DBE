Item #: 499

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 499 is allowed to continue his political career alongside proper surveillance from Foundation agents. In the event of any behavior that seems to be anomalous in nature, immediate intervention is to be provided. Under no circumstances should 499 gain uncontrollable access to any form of intelligence.

Description: Subject 499 is a male human of average height and build. His facial features include a prominent mole, located just below the lips, with a bold red coloration, and his eyes are an unsettling shade of red. He is commonly seen wearing a bright red beanie, paired with a medical mask that conceals his mouth. Subject 499 also wears an exquisite jade earring and a thick chunk of gold chain.

Personality: 499 harbors a strong sense of responsibility towards his work, pushing himself to take on more significant roles regardless of how taxing the projects may be. Despite his strict adherence to his job, he takes organizing social events as an opportunity to let his hair down and loosen up. Displaying a talent for dancing, the subject is known to surprise onlookers with his impressive moves, making him approachable to many. It is these particular personality traits which make identifying any anomalous behavior difficult.

Addendum: It is possible that 499 is capable of using his dance routines to manipulate those close to him. However, there is currently no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis. Foundation operatives are urged to stay on high alert in his presence.
