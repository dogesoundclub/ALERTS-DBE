SCP-6115 is a peculiar humanoid creature, belonging to the Homo sapiens species with unique physical characteristics that distinguish him from normal humans. The subject's face is adorned with a singular black spot residing above the mouth, a perplexing attribute which has never been fully comprehended. The irises within the ski goggle eyes of SCP-6115 have a distinct fluorescent green hue, a trait utterly abnormal in humans. The head of the subject is ritualistically dyed pink, parted to one side neatly. The only accessory of SCP-6115 is a small silver chain that dangles around the neck, indicative of the subject's personal preference. The most peculiar feature of SCP-6115 is the pair of jade earrings that dangle gracefully from each earlobe. 

In terms of personality, SCP-6115 is entirely unique. Known for their quick wit and love of debate, the subject's verbal dexterity and sharp intellect can often lead to amusing conversations that are thoroughly enjoyed by those around them. SCP-6115 is particularly good at arguing and takes pleasure in engaging in playful debates with friends and family. Though seemingly harmless, the Foundation has noted that this characteristic could be used to confuse and distract targets of SCP-6115 in the field. As such, the subject's behaviour is to be closely monitored at all times.
