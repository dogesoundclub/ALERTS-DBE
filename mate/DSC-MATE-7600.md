Item #: 7600

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7600 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All interactions with 7600 must be monitored and supervised by trained personnel. The subject must not be allowed access to any sharp objects, as they have demonstrated a tendency towards violence in the past. In addition, any requests made by 7600 must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel before being carried out.

Description: DSC-MATE-7600 is a male Rabbit of indeterminate age who takes the form of a fast food worker. The subject measures approximately 1.3 meters in height and weighs 42 kilograms. DSC-MATE-7600 possesses red clown eyes and green hair in a purple cap. Their forehead features include two color bands and goggles. Subject wears a silver chain, which appears to have no anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-7600 is known for their quick wit and love of debate. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as engaging in playful arguments with friends or family members just for fun. However, when provoked, the subject has demonstrated a tendency towards violence, and has been observed attacking other DSCs with sharpened utensils from their workplace.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7600 was brought to the attention of the foundation after an incident in which they broke into a rival fast food establishment and stole thousands of dollars worth of equipment. During interrogation, DSC-MATE-7600 claimed that they did it in retaliation for the other establishment's "inferior chicken wings." It is unclear if this is a genuine motive or if the subject was simply trying to cause chaos. Further research is needed.
