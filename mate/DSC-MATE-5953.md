Item #: 5953

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5953 is to be monitored by a covert team of Foundation agents, operating under the guise of railway inspectors and supervisors. In the event of any anomalous or suspicious activity, the team is authorized to take swift and decisive action, using any means necessary to neutralize the threat posed by the subject. However, given the benign nature of 5953’s abilities and temperament, Foundation intervention is only required in the most extreme circumstances.

Description: Subject 5953 appears to be a human male, approximately 35 years of age, with distinctive facial features. The subject’s most notable characteristic is the orange stripes that run across their face, giving them a tiger-like appearance. Their face is usually adorned with a friendly smile, revealing white, diamond-shaped teeth. 5953’s eyes are cybernetic, with VR Jade LED technology, capable of analyzing, enhancing, and recording visual data.

The subject’s head is crowned with a bright red beanie, which they rarely remove, even in warm weather. 5953 often sports a gold chain around their neck, adorned with various decorative objects. They are also frequently seen with a glossy candy stick, which they chew on, producing a faint raspberry scent.

In terms of personality, 5953 is highly observant and attentive to details, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, their perfectionism can sometimes lead to indecisiveness, causing them to spend excessive amounts of time agonizing over what to get someone. Despite this, Subject 5953 is generally amicable, kind-hearted, and easy to get along with. They have been employed as a train driver for several years, with no recorded incidents of anomaly or misconduct.

Addendum 5953-A: On 09/05/20██, Subject 5953 was detained by Foundation agents after exhibiting unusual cognitive abilities. During an interview, 5953 revealed that they had accidentally acquired their enhanced visual powers while consuming a batch of tainted candy sticks. They claimed that the candy was an experimental product made by a clandestine organization. Further investigation is ongoing.
