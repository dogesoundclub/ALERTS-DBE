Description: SCP-3075 is a non-anomalous 36-year-old male of the species Panthera tigris, commonly known as a tiger. SCP-3075 is equipped with a silver chain accessory and a jade earring on each ear. Its head features green hair in a purple cap, with a goggle on its forehead and a medical mask covering its mouth.

SCP-3075 has proven to be a skilled programmer and works diligently on a variety of projects. Its idealistic nature sometimes causes it to become distracted from its duties, as it may feel compelled to protest or boycott certain causes it feels goes against its values. SCP-3075's strong desire to make the world a better place is both a strength and a weakness that must be managed by its containment team.

The team successfully identified and neutralized SCP-3075's hacking attempts, but this incident highlights the need for close monitoring of SCP-3075's activities.
