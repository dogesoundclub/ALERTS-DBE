Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-20 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber outfitted with standard amenities appropriate for its species. Access to DSC-MATE-20 requires Level 2 clearance or higher.

DSC-MATE-20 is permitted to leave its containment chamber for the purpose of performing its duties as a Police Officer, but must be monitored by at least two Foundation personnel at all times. Should the DSC-MATE-20 engage in reckless behavior or exhibit aggressive tendencies, standard tranquilizing protocols must be followed.

Description: DSC-MATE-20 is a human male with an unusual appearance. It is characterized by a purple cap with a headset, green cross earring, gold chain, and nerd glasses. DSC-MATE-20 also has spotted facial features, with an ever-present smile and medical mask covering its mouth.

DSC-MATE-20 has a tendency to act impulsively and without thinking things through, often leading to humorous situations. It has been known to engage in reckless behavior and may seek to impress those around it, even at the risk of minor injury or harm.

DSC-MATE-20's performance as a Police Officer has been noted as exemplary, though its tendency towards recklessness persists. Its colleagues frequently comment on its sunny disposition and infectious smile.

Given DSC-MATE-20's species and behavior patterns, it is deemed to be of low risk to Foundation operations. However, continued monitoring and containment are necessary to ensure the safety of both DSC-MATE-20 and those around it.
