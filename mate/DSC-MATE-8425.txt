Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8425 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject is allowed to carry out her job as a news anchor, under the close supervision of Foundation operatives. All interviews conducted by SCP-8425 are to be monitored and all scripts read before broadcasting.

Description: SCP-8425 is a female human news anchor, with orange eyebrows, 00s school girl head, and green cross earrings. The subject wears a medical mask and a two-color band on her forehead, as well as a gold chain.

SCP-8425 has a very empathetic and compassionate personality. The subject tends to take on others' problems as her own and feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around her. These characteristics can be both admirable and a bit draining. SCP-8425 is unaware of her anomalous properties.

SCP-8425's broadcasts have been found to have a calming effect on viewers, making them more receptive to ideas presented in the news segment. Foundation researchers are currently studying the extent of SCP-8425's influence.

Addendum: SCP-8425's anomalous powers were discovered during an investigation into a series of unexplained suicides in the region. All victims had watched a news segment presented by SCP-8425 prior to their deaths. Further investigation revealed that those who had not watched the news but were in the vicinity of those who had were also affected. Foundation operatives intervened and suppressed all knowledge of SCP-8425's broadcasting from the public.
