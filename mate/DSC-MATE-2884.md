Item #: 2884

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2884 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to their previous occupation as a fast food worker, DSC-MATE-2884 has been granted permission to work at the Site's cafeteria.

Description: DSC-MATE-2884 is a human male with several unique physical features. On their face, DSC-MATE-2884 has a noticeable mouth spot and a constant smile, revealing their set of red clown eyes. DSC-MATE-2884 regularly wears a bucket hat and has a pair of goggles rest atop their forehead. They have a jade earring pierced in one of their ears, and a medical mask covering their mouth. DSC-MATE-2884 is also often seen with a gold chain accessory around their neck.

DSC-MATE-2884 tends to be very empathetic and compassionate, showing admirable kindness towards those around them. However, their empathy often leads to them taking on other people's problems as their own, potentially leading to exhaustion. Though DSC-MATE-2884 has not displayed any anomalous abilities, their sheer willingness to "fix everything and everyone around them" has brought them to the Foundation's attention.

Addendum: After an incident in the cafeteria involving DSC-MATE-2884, a temporary ban has been put in place on DSC-MATE-2884-1 (known to civilians as "Happy Meals"). It is unknown if this anomaly was caused by DSC-MATE-2884 or if it was a pre-existing anomalous item. Investigations are ongoing.
