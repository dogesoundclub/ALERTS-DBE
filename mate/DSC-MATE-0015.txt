Item #: SCP-15

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-15 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit with appropriate amenities for human subjects. The cigarette provided to SCP-15 must be replaced daily to ensure compliance with Foundation regulations. Personnel interacting with SCP-15 must take note of her visual anomaly, and any reports of malfunctioning VR modules must be investigated. Unauthorized individuals may not be allowed to enter SCP-15's containment unit without prior authorization.

Description: SCP-15 is a female human in her late twenties, with brown hair styled according to fashion trends typical of the 1990s. She is generally friendly towards Foundation personnel and enjoys cracking jokes, even in stressful situations. SCP-15 has been observed telling humorous stories and doing impressions of various personalities to make others laugh. This behavior appears to be genuine and unrehearsed.

SCP-15's most distinctive feature is her mesmerizing jade LED eyes, which are likely the product of cybernetic augmentation. It is unknown if this implant is functional, but it has been determined through experimentation that SCP-15 reacts negatively to attempts to access the implant through conventional means.

SCP-15's accoutrements consist of a silver chain worn around her neck and a cigarette that she is allowed to light up with moderation. She does not appear to exhibit any addictive behaviors towards tobacco, and this allowance serves mainly to maintain compliance by SCP-15, who tends to be cooperative overall.

In conclusion, although SCP-15 appears to be a benign entity, it must be constantly monitored to ensure that her behavior and visual anomaly do not compromise the security of the Foundation. Personnel are advised to interact with her cautiously but kindly, as her demeanor may be a form of manipulation. Any unexplained changes or anomalies in SCP-15's behavior should be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities.
