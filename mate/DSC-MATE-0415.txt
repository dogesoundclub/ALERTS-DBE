Item #: 415

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-415 is to be housed in a temperature-controlled containment room with reinforced walls to prevent any unauthorized access. SCP-415 should not be activated without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-415 is a firefighter robot with a green cyclops eye and ski goggle-like lenses. Its head consists of a variety of asymmetrical, not arranged green metal plating. Upon activation, it will initially appear to be dormant or asleep. However, upon receiving a direct command or sensing a fire, it will immediately activate.

SCP-415 is generally reliable and organized, but it can be incredibly stubborn, particularly when it comes to routines and accepting new ideas. This has caused some humorous situations during unexpected changes or challenges. Thus, all personnel interacting with SCP-415 should prepare for potential resistance to necessary changes in operating procedures.

Additionally, SCP-415 is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a cigarette. The purpose of these additional items is unknown.

Addendum 415-A: Research has shown that SCP-415 has a complex system of internal wiring and functionality. However, attempts to reverse-engineer the technology have failed due to the robot's sophisticated security protocols. Any attempts to tamper with SCP-415 are strictly prohibited.
