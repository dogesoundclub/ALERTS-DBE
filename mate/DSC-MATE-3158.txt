Item #: SCP-3158

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3158 is to be contained in a standard holding cell at Site-██. SCP-3158 is not to be allowed any direct contact with personnel or other SCPs, as such interactions have been known to incite severe panic attacks in SCP-3158.

Description: SCP-3158 is a sapient rabbit that primarily works as a train driver for ██████ Railroad Company. SCP-3158's physical appearance is unremarkable for its species, with the exception of a headset affixed to its head that emits a constant blue LED light. SCP-3158 is typically observed smoking a cigarette, which appears to help it maintain a state of placidity.

SCP-3158 exhibits a personality that is atypical for its species. While rabbits are generally known for being skittish and wary, SCP-3158 is outgoing and possesses a creative and artistic side that it expresses through various hobbies and interests. SCP-3158 has been observed drawing and painting in its leisure time, and appears to derive great satisfaction from these activities.

Due to SCP-3158's disproportionate emotional responses towards human interaction, continued exposure to Foundation personnel must be limited. SCP-3158's containment protocols primarily involve providing it with art supplies and other diversions that can be used to mitigate the impact of its confinement.

Addendum: SCP-3158 was recovered by Mobile Task Force Lambda-8 ("Bunny Wranglers") after several reports of a "strange rabbit driving trains" in the area. Upon capturing SCP-3158, it was found to be cooperative and relatively docile. Investigations are ongoing as to how SCP-3158 acquired its current position and if it is the only instance of a nonhuman sapient individual employed in the transportation industry.
