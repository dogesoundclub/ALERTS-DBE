Description: Item #1074 is a male rabbit with an odd choice of accessories. He prefers to wear Horned Rim Glasses, a Retro Cap, and a Gold Earring on his right ear. Most notably, he wears a mask of LEDs which has no recorded function up to this point. 

Personality: Item #1074 possesses a scatterbrained personality, often forgetting important appointments and getting lost whilst trying to locate new places. This personality quirk may bring forth humorous moments although the personnel must remain vigilant when interacting with it. 

It is discovered that Item #1074's occupation is related to mechanics, thus his presence within the facility is to assist in the repairing of any electronic machinery or trinkets. 

It has been noted that when Item #1074 successfully repairs a machine, he will reward himself with a carrot, a stereotypical characteristic of rabbits. 

Under no circumstances should personnel provide any type of gadget or object to Item #1074 out of containment, as he has been known to dismantle and reassemble them without permission, which could result in devastating consequences.

The Foundation will continue to research the significance of Item #1074's unusual mask and report any significant findings to higher-ranking officials.
