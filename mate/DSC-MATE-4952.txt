Item #: SCP-4952

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4952 is to be monitored regularly by Foundation personnel. While SCP-4952 is not a danger to anyone, his uncanny ability to predict the future and sense emotions could potentially disrupt the normalcy of human society. As such, it is imperative that SCP-4952 is not allowed to divulge information about his abilities to the public.

Description: SCP-4952 is a Caucasian male in his 30s, standing at 5’10” tall. He has a friendly disposition and a charming smile. SCP-4952's most distinguishing feature is a series of spots on his face, which he claims are birthmarks. He typically wears a retro cap and green cross earring on one ear, and his eyes are concealed behind normal glasses.

SCP-4952 has the ability to sense emotions and predict the future. While it is unknown how he acquired these abilities, it is clear that he has honed them over time. He may seem like he has psychic powers, but it is unclear if SCP-4952 is aware of the anomaly that manifests within him.

SCP-4952 currently works as a car salesman, and it is rumored that his success rate is due in part to his ability to sense a potential customer’s desires and needs. Foundation personnel have noted that SCP-4952 has never consciously misused his abilities, but he may occasionally feel frustrated that he cannot control them.

Addendum: Interviews suggest that SCP-4952 has been aware of his abilities since childhood. It is unclear if anyone in his family possessed similar powers, but Foundation personnel are exploring the possibility of a genetic connection. Further research and testing are ongoing.
