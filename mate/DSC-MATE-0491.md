DogeSoundClub Containment Report

Item #: DSC-MATE-491

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-491 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate food and water provisions for a rabbit. The containment chamber is to be secured with a standard locking mechanism and monitored by CCTV cameras 24/7. One (1) armed guard is to be stationed outside the containment chamber at all times.

DSC-MATE-491's duties as a security guard for Site-██ are to be limited to non-sensitive areas of the facility only. All DSC-MATE-491's duties are to be under strict supervision to prevent unauthorized access to secure areas.

To prevent the possibility of DSC-MATE-491's escape, the rabbit is to be sedated during any movement outside of its containment chamber. Any further requests requiring DSC-MATE-491's participation outside of the standard protocol must be approved by at least one Level 4 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-491 is a male rabbit with ski goggle eyes and a red beanie covering its head. The creature appears to be in a constant state of panic with a frightened mouth expression. Although DSC-MATE-491 has characteristics of a regular rabbit, it is capable of speech and can communicate fluently in the English language.

DSC-MATE-491 has exhibited an unusual personality characteristic, displaying a vivid imagination and creativity throughout its captivity. Its hobbies and interests range from writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. While these interests are harmless, there is concern among staff that DSC-MATE-491's creativity may lead to potentially dangerous scenarios.

DSC-MATE-491 has shown a reluctance to perform its duties as a security guard, expressing fear and anxiety about potential security breaches. Due to its limited capabilities, all of DSC-MATE-491's tasks are monitored closely, and it is restricted to non-sensitive areas of the facility. DSC-MATE-491's fear of danger has made it an unreliable source of protection.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-491's anomalous properties were first discovered during a routine performance evaluation by security personnel at Site-██. Upon discovery, DSC-MATE-491 was immediately contained, and an investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-491 had been hired as a security guard based on a clerical error. All relevant personnel have been reprimanded for the mistake.

While DSC-MATE-491's anomalous properties are not inherently dangerous, they may prove problematic in a facility such as Site-██. Further research into DSC-MATE-491's abilities and limitations is necessary to ensure its containment and prevent any potential incidents.
