Item #: DSC-MATE-8719

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8719 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. All interactions with DSC-MATE-8719 are to be conducted through a speaker system to avoid any potential hostile behavior from the anomaly.

DSC-MATE-8719 is to be provided with basic clothing and clothing-making materials in the containment chamber to keep the entity occupied. Any requests for new materials or items must be approved by Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-8719, also known as "The Fashion Designer," appears to be a humanoid male with orange stripes on their face, a broad smile, and a purple cap with a headset covering their head. DSC-MATE-8719's ears are pierced with green cross-shaped earrings, and the entity is often seen wearing a red scarf and holding a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-8719's personality appears to be laid-back and easy-going, but it can also display fiercely loyal and protective behavior towards its loved ones. This protective behavior has been known to lead to heated arguments when someone insults a friend or family member of DSC-MATE-8719.

DSC-MATE-8719 has displayed an avid interest and skill in fashion design and has shown a desire to create clothing and accessories. However, DSC-MATE-8719's creations have also displayed anomalous effects, such as causing those who wear them to develop unusual behaviors and motivations.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-8719 created an outfit that caused a breach in containment when a staff member wearing it unexpectedly gained telekinetic abilities. Level 3 personnel are to approve all requests for materials and items for DSC-MATE-8719 to prevent any further incidents.
