Item #: 9052

Object Class: Unknown

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9052 is to be monitored by agents at all times while performing their duties as a train driver. Any anomalous activity or behavior is to be reported immediately to the containment team.

Description: SCP-9052 is a male monkey sporting a red beanie and carrying a whistle at all times. While outwardly appearing to be a typical monkey, SCP-9052 possesses enhanced observational skills and attention to detail.

SCP-9052's heightened senses and analysis allow them to perform their job with great skill, but also leads to a particularly unique and troubling trait. SCP-9052 obsesses over gift-giving, spending an unreasonable amount of time attempting to find the "perfect" gift for those around them. This behavior has caused SCP-9052 considerable distress and can result in significant cognitive strain.

SCP-9052's species, breed, and origin are currently unknown. Attempts to ascertain additional information about SCP-9052 have proven futile.

Personality: SCP-9052 is a diligent worker and able to maintain control even under extreme circumstances. While possessing a generally amiable personality, SCP-9052's gift-giving anxieties are both frustrating and alarming. SCP-9052 is aware of their compulsion and seems to be in constant battle with it, often remaining withdrawn from the rest of the group.

SCP-9052 has yet to demonstrate any anomalous capabilities beyond their gift-giving fixation. However, their unique skills and obsessions make them a top priority for careful examination and containment.

Addendum: SCP-9052's uncertain origin and abilities are cause for alarm, and therefore, it is imperative that all attempts are made to gather additional data on this creature. As a result, task force agents have been sent to investigate potential areas where SCP-9052 could have originated from.
