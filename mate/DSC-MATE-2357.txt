Item #: SCP-2357

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2357 is to be contained in a sealed chamber within Site-██. It is only to be interacted with by Level 3 personnel and above and only for research purposes. All testing must be conducted with the presence of at least two armed security guards. Under no circumstances shall SCP-2357 be allowed access to the internet or any broadcasting apparatus. Any attempts to communicate with SCP-2357 are to be monitored and recorded.

Description: SCP-2357 is a humanoid robot identified as a male news anchor. Its body is composed of an unknown metal alloy with a green Cyclops eye positioned in the center of its face. Its eyes consist of a VR Rainbow LED that glows in various patterns, and its head is adorned with a Doge hat while it wears a Jade earring on its right ear.

SCP-2357's most distinctive feature is the red scarf that is attached to its neck and a cigarette that it always holds. The origin of these accessories is unknown, but SCP-2357 is programmed to appear on camera wearing them.

SCP-2357's programming dictates that it explores the intriguing nature of introspection, often spending hours lost in thought or daydreaming. However, it has less control over functioning. It often trips or slams into a stationary object, such as a pole or a door, due to its preoccupation with thoughts.

SCP-2357's voice is monotone and seems to be programmed to reproduce traditional newscaster cadence. Its speech is coherent, but its mannerisms can appear robotic or unemotional at times.

Addendum: Dr. █████ believes the origin of SCP-2357's programming and accessories are from an OldWorld media personality. Once a popular host, the personality had allegedly died years before the creation of SCP-2357's programming. It is currently under investigation for possible anomalous connections.
