Item #: 6100

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6100 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. This chamber must be fitted with a specialized anti-tampering device in order to prevent any unauthorized access to the item. Only authorized personnel are permitted to interact with Item 6100, and all interactions must be supervised by at least one security officer. Should any unusual behavior be noted in Item 6100, a full psychological evaluation must be conducted immediately.

Description: Item 6100 is a female human of average height and build, with not arranged green hair and a medical mask covering her mouth. The most notable feature of Item 6100 are its eyes, which are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology. These eyes are capable of displaying a wide range of colors and patterns, and are often observed to change in response to Item 6100's mood or emotional state. Additionally, Item 6100 wears a gold chain around its neck at all times.

Personality: Item 6100 displays an unusually high level of attentiveness and observation skills, which can make it a valuable asset in many working environments. However, Item 6100 is also known to become overly concerned with perfectionism, particularly in regards to gift-giving. This has been observed to cause Item 6100 significant distress and may impact its ability to perform day-to-day tasks. It is recommended that all holidays and special occasions be handled with care in Item 6100's presence, and that any gifts received be carefully selected in advance to avoid causing undue stress.

Addendum: Item 6100 was acquired by the Foundation after it was discovered that it had been practicing law without proper licensing or credentials. Despite this, Item 6100 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in regards to legal matters. However, its tendency towards perfectionism must be monitored carefully in order to avoid any potential risks to Foundation security or morale.
