DSC-MATE-7364 is a highly peculiar specimen that exhibits a range of unusual physical features that are unlike any human being we have ever encountered. This creature possesses red clown eyes that provide a stark contrast against the parted pink hair that adorns its head. The ears are also of particular note, featuring a single jade earring that is clearly visible even from a distance.

As a doctor, DSC-MATE-7364's analytical and logical nature are highly beneficial in their line of work. However, their quirky sense of humor often surfaces unexpectedly, making them unpredictable at times. With a penchant for dry, deadpan humor, DSC-MATE-7364 enjoys making witty observations and teasing their compatriots, at times even toying with them for their own amusement.

Further observations reveal that this creature seems to have an addiction to candy sticks, often found with one in their possession at all times. Despite their quirks, DSC-MATE-7364 remains a valuable member of our team, providing insight and innovative solutions to problems that baffle even the most talented of scientists.

As with many of the specimens under our supervision, there is much about DSC-MATE-7364 that remains unknown. However, we at the Foundation shall continue to monitor their behavior and interactions, in order to better understand this highly unusual creature.
