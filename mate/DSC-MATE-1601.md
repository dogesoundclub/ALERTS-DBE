Item #: 1601

Object Class: Euclid

Job Description: Firefighter

Species: Panthera tigris

Gender: Male

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1601 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-19. All interactions with the subject must be conducted through a secure speaker system, as the subject is incredibly territorial and has demonstrated aggressive behavior towards personnel who enter their cell. Weekly health checks and psychological evaluations are mandatory for subject 1601.

Description: Subject 1601 is a male tiger with red clown eyes, a frightened mouth, and a headset with LED lighting. The subject is often seen wearing a two-color band on their forehead, a gold chain around their neck, and carrying a whistle. Despite their intimidating appearance, subject 1601 tends to be very caring and nurturing, even extending this behavior to inanimate objects. They have been observed anthropomorphizing their car, plants, and household appliances.

Personality: Subject 1601 has a strong sense of duty and takes their job as a firefighter very seriously. They instinctively protect and care for those in need, often risking their own safety to do so. However, the subject is also incredibly territorial and easily agitated, particularly if their "belongings" are threatened. Psychological evaluations have suggested that this behavior may stem from an intense fear of loss and abandonment.

Addendum: In Incident 1601-Alpha, subject 1601 became agitated during standard health checks and attacked several personnel, causing significant injuries. It is recommended that all personnel approaching subject 1601 exercise extreme caution and refrain from any actions that may be interpreted as threatening. Additionally, subject 1601's headset has been modified to emit a calming frequency in hopes of reducing aggressive behavior.
