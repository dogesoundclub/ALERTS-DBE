Description: DSC-MATE-4012 appears to be a human female in her mid-thirties with orange stripes on her cheeks, purple lips, red clown eyes, and jade earrings. DSC-MATE-4012 also possesses pigtail hairstyles that hang just above the shoulders. DSC-MATE-4012's face features are permanent and cannot be removed or altered by normal means.

DSC-MATE-4012, known by her civilian alias as a Real Estate Agent, is known for her extraordinary charisma and ability to connect with people. She has been able to easily make connections with individuals as well as groups on a deep emotional level, causing humorous situations in which strangers, acquaintances, and even enemies open up to her and share their life stories. DSC-MATE-4012 has also been observed telling humorous anecdotes that further bring people together.

DSC-MATE-4012's abilities and facial features have led the Foundation to speculate that she could be an offshoot of an unknown species. Her medical mask serves to prevent any contagious infections, while the silver chain is still under investigation for its possible anomalous properties.
