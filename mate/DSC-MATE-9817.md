Item #: 9817

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 9817 is to be kept in an individual cage measuring 2m x 2m x 2m. The cage must have a small garden area installed to mimic its natural habitat. Access to this area must be given for certain periods of the day.

Human interaction with 9817 must be minimal, and restricted to monitoring only. Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to touch or physically interact with 9817 without permission from supervisor.

Following Incident 9817-A, all traffic infractions in the area in which 9817 is stationed must be handled by local law enforcement.

Description: 9817 is a male rabbit of the cybernetic class. It has gained sentience and intelligence through an unknown source of radiation. 9817 wears a red scarf and a jade earring on both ears. It has a pair of VR Jade LED eyes, which function as an interface to analyze its surroundings. Additionally, 9817 possesses a frightened mouth; it reflects its empathetic body language and state of mind.

9817's main duty is to direct traffic in its assigned area. It accomplishes this task with surprising efficiency, despite its small size. It analyses traffic patterns and responds with quick, precise gestures and blows of its whistle.

Aside from performing traffic duties, 9817 has displayed an unusual level of empathy for a nonhuman DSC entity. It can accurately interpret the intentions and emotions of other individuals, as well as providing comfort and humor in times of stress.

Incident 9817-A: On ██/██/20██, 9817 displayed erratic behavior after witnessing a pedestrian's violent death in a hit-and-run incident. This resulted in a small-scale outbreak of chaotic traffic in the area, culminating in significant property damage and multiple injuries.

Addendum: Research on the radiation source responsible for 9817's sapience and empathic nature is ongoing. It is suggested that further study be conducted to understand how the radiation has affected 9817's brain function and behavior.
