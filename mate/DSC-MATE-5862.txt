Subject 5862, also known as "The Tiger Politician," is a unique specimen in the urban fantasy world. Identified as a tiger, male in sex, 5862 possesses a rather unusual appearance. The subject's eyes are reminiscent of ski goggles, which might be half-fitting considering the subject's profession.

The politician sports a blue bandana on their head, tied over a set of gold earrings. But perhaps the most distinct attribute of subject 5862 is the goggle that remains perched on their forehead, a testament to the politician's love for skiing.

Despite their position of power, 5862's personality is a bit of a wild card. The politician can be impulsive and act on their emotions rather than rational thinking. These tendencies often lead to amusing or unexpected situations that leave others amused, if not bewildered.

Despite any potential setbacks, subject 5862 has proved to be a force to be reckoned with in the political world, displaying an unwavering conviction towards their beliefs and tactics. However, their unpredictable nature only furthers their notoriety in both respect and awe.
