Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-51 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Interactions with SCP-51 should be limited to authorized personnel only. Any attempts to harm or threaten SCP-51's loved ones will result in immediate termination.

Description:
SCP-51 appears to be a human female in her mid-30s, standing at approximately 5'6" tall. The subject's most distinguishing features are her orange stripes and purple lip, which can be seen clearly despite their unusual nature. SCP-51's eyes are also notable, with bright orange eyebrows that contrast against her otherwise unremarkable brown irises.

SCP-51's head and ears are also slightly unusual, with an orange side and green cross earring, respectively. Despite these physical anomalies, SCP-51 appears to be in good health and does not exhibit any overt signs of discomfort.

SCP-51's personality is laid-back and easy-going, and has been described by previous associates as "charming" and "friendly." However, SCP-51 is fiercely loyal and quick to defend her loved ones, regardless of possible consequences. This has resulted in several humorous situations, such as heated arguments with strangers who insult friends or family members.

Addendum:
SCP-51 was discovered after reports of a "charming" car salesman in a small town. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and uncovered SCP-51's true nature. Attempts to convince SCP-51 to join the Foundation were successful, and the subject now operates as a successful cover identity for the organization.
