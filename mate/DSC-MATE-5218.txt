SCP-5218, also known as "The Tiger Theater Manager", is a male humanoid tiger who currently works as the manager of a local theater. This creature is distinguished by their frightened mouth, which is often seen when in stressful situations. SCP-5218 is known to have normal glasses which enhance its visual capabilities. Additionally, their head is topped by a police cap and an antique goggle is always attached to their forehead. 

The creature is very fond of tradition and this makes them adhere to strict rules and principles. Their strict personality may make them seem intimidating and strict to outsiders, but it is often due to their strong sense of responsibility. However, SCP-5218 has also been observed to have a playful side, particularly when they engage in humorous activities such as telling jokes or sharing family stories. 

SCP-5218 owns two accessories, a silver chain around their neck, which is of unknown significance and a candy stick, which is believed to provide them with a sense of comfort. It is not currently understood why they cherish this item so much. 

Personnel are advised to maintain professionalism when interacting with SCP-5218, and avoid making unintended jokes or comments. While SCP-5218 may be playful at times, it should not be underestimated, as they are known to be skilled in physical combat. Any instances of disobedience or non-compliance should be reported immediately to the site director.
