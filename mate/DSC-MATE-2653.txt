SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-2653

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2653 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with banana leaves and branches as per SCP-2653's preference for dietary intake. SCP-2653 is to be provided with a daily allowance of up to five (5) bananas, as well as other fruits and vegetables for adequate nutritional value. All interactions with SCP-2653 must be monitored by trained personnel.

Description: SCP-2653 is a male monkey of undetermined species, appearing to be approximately 5 years old. Its distinguishing features include ski goggle-like eyes, jade earrings, and green hair beneath a purple cap. SCP-2653 also wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-2653 exhibits a friendly and goofy personality. It values harmony and social connections, often engaging in playful banter with others. SCP-2653 has also been observed telling jokes in its own form of communication.

SCP-2653's anomalous ability is the power to boost social connections between individuals within its proximity. Witnesses have reported feeling a sense of increased comfort and trust in the presence of SCP-2653. However, the full extent and limitations of this ability have not yet been determined.

Addendum: Following an incident where SCP-2653 escaped containment and ran rampant in a nearby fast food restaurant, it has been assigned the task of a fast-food worker. SCP-2653 has since shown a high level of competency in its assigned role and is rewarded with additional bananas as compensation.
