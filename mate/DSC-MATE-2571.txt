Description: SCP-2571 is a robotic humanoid entity, resembling a male farmer wearing a doge hat. It stands at approximately 2.1 meters in height, weighing approximately 600 kilograms.

However, the purpose of the whistle is not fully understood at this time. 

SCP-2571's personality is upbeat and energetic, exhibiting a love for life and an enthusiasm for anything and everything.

SCP-2571 was discovered on a farm in the middle of the United States. The owner of the farm reported strange occurrences happening at night, including crop circles and missing farm equipment. After Foundation agents investigated and contained SCP-2571, all further incidents ceased.
