Item #: 2060

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2060 is to be monitored at all times and is to be confined within a specialized containment chamber at Site-██. All attempts to remove the pink rabbit head covering are strictly prohibited, as any attempts of removal may lead to unpredictable side effects. Physical restraints are to be used in case of unpredictable behavior.

Description: Subject 2060 appears to be a female human of average height with normal glasses. However, hidden beneath the pink rabbit head which covers the entirety of her face, renders her with a startlingly distinctive appearance. Her forehead features a two-color band which serves no discernible purpose other than decoration. The subject's ears hold a Red Cross Earring that is believed to be self-applied. She continually wears a medical mask to cover her mouth, further intensifying the mysterious persona of subject 2060. Her favorite accessory is a black choker, which she is usually seen wearing at all times.

Subject 2060 is animated and exhibits a high level of enthusiasm regardless of the situation. Her contagious energy has been known to inspire those around her, even in the midst of bleak or mundane tasks. However, her effervescence can lead to a lack of decorum, becoming overly excited at times, causing others to feel uncomfortable.

Addendum: Due to unclear origins and the mystery shrouding the object's nature, the Foundation is conducting further research to understand both the nature and limits of subject 2060's power. All research is to be strictly monitored and is only to proceed under the supervision of at least two Level 3 personnel. Any unauthorized actions or interactions with subject 2060 are to be reported immediately.
