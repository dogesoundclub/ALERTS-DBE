Item #: 3686

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 3686 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. No contact with sentient organisms is allowed without prior approval from at least one Level 4 personnel. Any personnel who come into contact with 3686 must undergo an extensive psychological evaluation before being allowed to return to duty. 

Description: Item 3686 is a robotic humanoid standing at approximately 6'3" in height. Its face is marked by a single, green cyclops eye and a constant frightened mouth. The entity sports green hair under a purple cap and a medical mask covering its mouth. Additionally, it wears a silver chain around its neck. 

Though it is a machine, Item 3686 possesses a unique capacity for empathy and charm. The entity has an incredible ability to connect with organic beings on a personal and emotional level, often leading to startling levels of transparency from its interlocutors. Despite its anomaly, 3686 is generally affable and open to conversationâ€”with approval.

Addendum: Following a series of interviews with the entity, it appears that Item 3686 has been programmed to function as a lawyer. Its creators designed it to be particularly adept at diffusing hostilities and negotiating compromises between opposing parties. However, its ability to extract the truth from people with whom it speaks raises concerns as to the nature of its programming. Further study is necessary.
