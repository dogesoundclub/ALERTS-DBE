Item #: SCP-1322

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1322 is to be kept under surveillance and monitored regularly by on-site personnel. SCP-1322 is allowed to continue their occupation as a farmer, but under strict conditions regulated by the Foundation. SCP-1322 is not allowed to leave their designated area except for emergencies or pre-approved situations.

Description: SCP-1322 is a human female, approximately 48 years of age, standing at 5'10" in height, and weighing approximately 160lbs. SCP-1322 possesses a unique appearance, featuring orange stripes on their face, a red lip, and a forehead with two color bands. They also wear a green cross earring on each ear and a choker around their neck. SCP-1322's most notable attribute is their attachment to smoking cigarettes.

SCP-1322 possesses a prominent personality trait of being reliable and organized, but also quite stubborn. They have a hard time letting go of their routines or accepting new ideas, and this can lead to amusing situations when they encounter unexpected changes or challenges. SCP-1322 is well-regarded among neighbors and peers but is also known for being somewhat elusive.

Despite their impressive organizational skills, SCP-1322 has a tendency to be overprotective of their farm and is known to become territorial when others interfere or attempt to get close. Foundation personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution when approaching SCP-1322's boundaries.

Addendum: SCP-1322 has a remarkable farming ability, and Foundation scientists are continuing to study their skills for possible applications in future projects.
