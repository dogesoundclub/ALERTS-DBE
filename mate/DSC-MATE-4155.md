Item #: 4155

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4155 is to be monitored constantly, and any significant changes in behavior or physiology reported immediately to the Overwatch Department. Given that the subject is a member of the general population and poses no direct threat to Foundation interests, it is considered sufficiently contained. Any interactions with the subject must be approved by the appropriate level of supervision, with a memetic operator present to ensure that their sense of humor does not breach security protocols.

Description: Subject 4155, known by the civilian alias [REDACTED], is a male human of no significant paranormal ability. Their appearance is of note, with two distinct facial features that can be used for identification purposes. Firstly, the subject has a distinctive Mouth Spot, measuring approximately .5 cm by .5 cm, located on the left side of their lower lip. This is a natural pigmentation and is otherwise unremarkable. Secondly, the subject's Smile, when displayed, exhibits a high level of curvature, often considered exaggerated by observers. The subject's lips part to such an extent that their teeth are visible, further accentuating the Smile. Subjects frequently report a feeling of unease when viewing this Smile, and some have even experienced memetic infection from it.

The subject's eyes are of identical dimensions to a normal human, but the coloring is anomalous. The iris and pupil are of a deep crimson color, which is often likened to the eyes of a clown. This is not known to have any negative effects on the subject and is not a marker of anomalous ability.

The subject is often seen wearing a Short Peak Cap, but this is also not anomalous and has no bearing on containment.

What sets Subject 4155 apart from others of their species is their unwavering sense of humor, which is always present in their mannerisms and conversation. They are known to have a great talent for telling amusing stories, performing silly impersonations, and generally joking around in most situations. While this has not caused any significant issues during containment, it is possible that the subject's sense of humor could become a liability in certain circumstances. As such, memetic operators should remain vigilant and keep close tabs on the subject's behavior.

Addendum: As of [REDACTED] Incident, Foundation personnel are reminded that Subject 4155's sense of humor must never be relied upon as a form of distraction or decoy. The consequences of doing so could have catastrophic effects on the integrity of the Foundation's mission.
