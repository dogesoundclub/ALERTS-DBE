Item #: SCP-6329

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6329 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls and a door controlled by a passcode. No personnel of level 3 clearance or higher are allowed to enter the chamber without proper authorization. All instances of SCP-6329 are to be regularly examined by medical staff for any signs of infection. SCP-6329 is to be given a sedative dose of Class-A during routine checkups to prevent escape attempts.

Description: SCP-6329 is a monkey of unknown origin that formerly worked as a train driver in ███████, ████. SCP-6329 exhibits physical features such as ski goggle eyes, parted pink hair, and jade earrings on both ears. It also wears an LED gas mask, which is believed to enhance its abilities to sense and navigate in low-light conditions. SCP-6329's abilities and characteristics have been observed as follows:

- Superhuman strength and agility: SCP-6329 can lift objects three times its own weight and move at speeds of up to 50km/h. Its acrobatic and parkour movements have been reported to surpass those of trained human athletes.

- Enhanced olfactory and auditory senses: SCP-6329 has been shown to detect odors and sounds from distances that far exceed the capacity of human senses. Its LED gas mask supposedly filters out any harmful substances from the environment and amplifies odor and sound signals.

- Scatterbrained personality: SCP-6329's cognitive function appears to be erratic, leading to forgetfulness, distraction, and occasional disorientation. The cause of this anomaly is currently unknown, but SCP-6329's brain scan shows abnormal neuronal activity in the frontal lobe.

Addendum: SCP-6329 was brought to Foundation attention when it caused a catastrophic derailment in the ███████ train station. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that SCP-6329 had tampered with the train's controls, causing it to exceed the maximum speed limit and collide with a nearby building. Due to SCP-6329's unpredictable nature, it poses a considerable risk to public safety and must be contained at all times. Research into SCP-6329's unique physiology, behavior, and history is pending approval.
