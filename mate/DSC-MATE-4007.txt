Object Class: Safe

Job Title: Programmer

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4007 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Due to the nature of its appearance, any personnel interacting with 4007 must do so through a glass barrier or by wearing hazmat gear to avoid any potential infection.

Description: Item 4007 appears to be a human male in his early 30s, with an unusual combination of facial features. Its face is covered in numerous spots, and its mouth is exaggeratedly shaped like a clown's. Its red eyes glow unnaturally in low light, and its head is always adorned with a tattered blue bandana. A gold earring is visible on its left ear, while its mouth is constantly concealed behind a medical mask. It wears a red scarf as its primary accessory.

Personality: Item 4007 exhibits a scatterbrained personality, frequently forgetting both small and significant details, and getting sidetracked on irrelevant matters. Due to its forgetfulness, it has a history of missing important appointments or getting lost while trying to navigate new places. However, its humorous behavior and clashing appearance often make others feel uneasy.

Addendum: The origins and reason for Item 4007's appearance are unknown. Research is ongoing, with the goal of better understanding its origins and possible causes of its unusual physical traits. Until then, Item 4007 is to remain under strict containment protocols.
