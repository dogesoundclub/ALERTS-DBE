Item #: 2697

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2697 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Any requests for legal assistance by SCP-2697 must be heavily scrutinized and approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-2697 is a male human of average height and build. One distinguishing feature is the presence of numerous spots across their face, which appear to be freckles. SCP-2697's eyes are unique in that they have been modified with VR Rainbow LED technology, allowing them to display various colors and patterns.

SCP-2697 is typically seen wearing a monk's robe and a gold chain around their neck, as well as an LED gas mask covering their mouth and nose. SCP-2697's use of the gas mask is not strictly necessary for survival, but rather a personal preference.

SCP-2697's personality is characterized by their analytical and logical nature. They enjoy engaging in intellectual debates and arguments, even if the topic seems trivial or unimportant to others. SCP-2697's argumentative tendencies can sometimes lead to humorous situations, such as heated debates over insignificant matters.

It should be noted that SCP-2697 frequently seeks out legal cases to work on, often representing individuals or entities that others may view as morally questionable or outright dangerous. SCP-2697's legal expertise should be utilized where possible, but caution must be exercised when considering requests for legal assistance.
