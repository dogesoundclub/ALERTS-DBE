SCP-9608, known by the code name "Vet" among the Foundation staff, is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face as her primary feature. Her blue clown-like eyes are often the first thing people notice, along with her perpetually friendly smile. She wears a purple cap with a headset, and a jade earring on one of her ears. Her mouth is often concealed with a medical mask due to the nature of her profession.

Despite her clownish appearance, Vet is a highly respected veterinarian who specializes in paranormal creatures. She possesses a calm yet authoritative demeanor, especially when dealing with more dangerous and unpredictable creatures. Her laid-back and easy-going personality makes her incredibly approachable, and many animals seem to instinctively trust her.

However, her loyalty and protectiveness towards her loved ones should not be underestimated. She has been known to become fiercely defensive of her friends and family, often leading to humorous situations where she gets into arguments with those who insult or threaten them.

The Foundation values Vet's expertise and her friendly yet authoritative personality, making her a valuable asset in dealing with anomalous creatures. Nevertheless, her jovial demeanor and unique appearance can sometimes make her the subject of teasing among her colleagues.
