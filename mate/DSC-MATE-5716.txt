Item #: SCP-5716


Object Class: Euclid


Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5716 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and monitored at all times due to her unpredictable behavior. Personnel interacting with SCP-5716 are advised to be cautious and avoid mentioning gifts or presents to prevent triggering her obsession. SCP-5716 is allowed to perform her job as a delivery driver for the SCP Foundation, but all packages and documents she transports must be thoroughly checked for potential breaches in security.

Description: SCP-5716 is a female human with distinctive red clown eyes and spots on her face, wearing a tiara and a pair of goggles on her forehead, a gold earring in each ear, and a silver chain around her neck. SCP-5716 also carries a cigarette as an accessory. While her appearance does not appear to pose any direct threat, her personality is cause for concern.

SCP-5716 is highly observant and attentive to details, making her an excellent gift-giver. However, she is also overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone. This obsession has spiraled out of control, and SCP-5716 has been observed stealing items to give as gifts, going to extreme lengths to acquire what she considers to be the perfect present. Her behavior could potentially compromise Foundation security if she steals classified documents or technology to give as gifts.

Further investigation has revealed that SCP-5716's gift-giving tendencies are the result of a deep-seated need to connect with others emotionally. While her behavior is concerning, it is not inherently malicious, and she has been cooperative during interactions with Foundation personnel.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5716's potential for breaching security and compromising containment, all personnel must remain vigilant when interacting with her. Any unusual gift-giving behavior or gift-related conversation must be reported to the relevant authorities.
