Description:

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6763 is to be provided with a secure work environment at all times, and should only be allowed access to specially designated areas. SCP-6763's mechanical tasks are to be supervised by a trained professional, with any deviations from protocol to be reported immediately to Site Director. Any interaction with SCP-6763 should be performed in a calm and collected manner to prevent any potential outbursts. 

Description: SCP-6763 is a male tiger, standing approximately two meters tall and weighing approximately three hundred kilograms. His face appears to be constantly in a state of fright, with his jaws twitching nervously. SCP-6763 is known to wear normal glasses over his two bright blue eyes and a doge hat on top of his head. His forehead is marked with a two-color band, and a red cross earring is visible on his right ear. SCP-6763's mouth is covered with a medical mask, preventing any close inspection of his facial features.

Personality: SCP-6763 can be characterized as rebellious and boundary-pushing. He seems to enjoy testing his limits, and often breaks rules purposefully or finds ways to bend them just for the fun of it. SCP-6763's curious behavior can lead to humorous situations, but it also poses a risk to the safety and security of Foundation personnel. SCP-6763 often displays sudden outbursts of aggression or defiance when provoked or presented with a challenge.

SCP-6763's job as a mechanic is essential to his containment. Providing him with regular mechanical tasks helps him to focus his energy and channel his curiosity towards productive work instead of disturbances. SCP-6763's work area is strictly monitored at all times, and any deviation from standard protocol is reported immediately to Site Director.

Addendum: SCP-6763's rebellious nature and potential danger to Foundation personnel require constant vigilance and careful handling. Measures need to be taken to help SCP-6763 control his impulses and maintain a safe work environment. The search for more effective containment procedures and therapy options should be continued.
