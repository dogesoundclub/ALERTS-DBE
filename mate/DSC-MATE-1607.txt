Item #: SCP-1607

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1607 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-1607 must wear a medical mask at all times to prevent potential contamination. Only authorized personnel are allowed to access SCP-1607's chamber.

Description: SCP-1607 is a Caucasian male human with blonde hair and normal glasses. Their face features spots and a frightened mouth. SCP-1607 wears a red victory band on their forehead, a gold earring on their ear, and a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-1607 works as a security guard and has a love for adventure, often taking risks and trying new things. Their personality has resulted in humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

SCP-1607's adventurous personality has caused concern for potential breaches in containment. However, to date, SCP-1607 has shown no anomalous behavior or ability. SCP-1607's containment procedures are deemed sufficient for safe containment.

Addendum: Due to SCP-1607's non-anomalous nature, the research team has recommended reclassification to Object Class Euclid. This request is pending approval from O5 Command.
