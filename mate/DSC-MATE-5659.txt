Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5659 is to be monitored at all times through regular check-ins and mandatory psychological evaluations. Subject's workplace, an animal clinic, is to be kept under surveillance for anomalous activity. If any abnormalities are detected, containment protocol must be initiated immediately.

Description: Subject 5659 is a human female with a contagious smile that radiates positivity. The subject's most notable feature are their bright blue clown eyes which can mesmerize those in their presence. Their head is often adorned with a retro cap and functional goggles secured onto the forehead. They wear a gold earring in both ears and a silver chain around their neck.

Subject 5659 is a veterinarian by profession but possesses an inexplicable charm and charisma that allows them to be the life of the party. Their bubbly personality often leads to comical situations where they tell jokes or perform silly dances to make others laugh.

Despite their friendly demeanor, subject 5659 has displayed exceptional medical skills and can quickly diagnose and treat animals. Further investigation is required to determine if this ability is related to any anomalous properties.

Addendum: Due to subject 5659's affiliations with the anomalous creature community, the Foundation has granted permission for them to provide medical care to sentient entities in containment. This decision is subject to review if any complications arise.
