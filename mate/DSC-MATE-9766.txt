SCP-9766, also known by the code name "The Flaming Ape," is a male monkey of unknown origin. His uniquely bizarre appearance includes a retro cap and a jade earring, as well as his most striking feature, his blue clown eyes. 

SCP-9766's profession as a firefighter adds to his already peculiar characteristics. The monkey has been observed to carry a normal gas mask with him at all times, appareantly as a precaution for fire-related incidents.

Despite his impressive strength and agility, SCP-9766 has a tendency to be stubborn and prideful. This ego can lead him to attempt ridiculous tasks alone, such as moving heavy furniture or navigating through unfamiliar areas without a map. He is fiercely independent, and may be reluctant to ask for help when he is in need.

SCP-9766 represents a unique opportunity for behavioral study when compared to other primates. His behavior and appearance defy conventional norms and challenge conventional ideas about urban fantasy characters. More research should be conducted in order to gain a better understanding of both his species and personality.
