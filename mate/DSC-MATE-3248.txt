Item #: SCP-3248

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3248 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. SCP-3248 is allowed limited contact with staff members to maintain its psychological and emotional well-being. All gifts given by SCP-3248 to any individual must be screened and approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3248 appears to be a human female in her mid-30s with distinct facial features. SCP-3248's face is marked with numerous spots, while its smile is particularly wide and unsettling. SCP-3248's eyes are constantly red and appear to be similar to that of a clown. Its head is made of blue metal, while its earrings are made of jade.

SCP-3248 carries a gold chain at all times, which it often unconsciously manipulates. SCP-3248 also wears a gas mask, which it uses to filter its breathing air. Despite its appearance, SCP-3248 requires neither food nor water.

SCP-3248 possesses an extremely observant and detail-oriented personality, allowing it to excel in multiple areas. However, SCP-3248 often fixates on finding the "perfect" gift for individuals it interacts with, spending long periods of time deciding on the gift. SCP-3248 becomes emotionally invested in the selection process, resulting in increased stress and anxiety levels.

Addendum 3248-1: SCP-3248's acquisition came to the Foundation's attention when reports of SCP-3248's gift-giving abilities began to circulate among the populace. Foundation agents apprehended SCP-3248 without incident and subsequently classified it as an SCP.

Addendum 3248-2: Level 3 clearance is required to access Document 3248-A, which details the incident involving a non-approved gift given by SCP-3248.
