SCP-9221 is a banker by profession and shows a significant amount of enthusiasm for its work. It has a tendency to get overly excited and animated about financial topics, causing others to become disinterested or intimidated. On occasion, SCP-9221 has attempted to convince individuals to invest large sums of money into various financial ventures, despite their lack of interest or knowledge of such things.

SCP-9221 has displayed no anomalous properties or abilities. However, due to its overly-enthusiastic nature, care must be taken when interacting with it to avoid being caught up in its excitement.

It is currently undergoing questioning and psychological evaluation to determine the extent of its culpability in the case. Further updates will follow pending completion of the investigation.
