Item #: SCP-9667

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9667 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit in Site-19. Routine maintenance is to be performed by staff trained in robotics engineering.

Description: SCP-9667 is a humanoid robot with a male appearance and a bucket hat covering his rounded head. He is equipped with normal glasses, a medical mask over his mouth, a goggle on his forehead, and a gold earring dangling from each ear. The robot also wears a red scarf around his neck as an accessory. SCP-9667 appears to function in a similar manner to a human, and carries out its role as a theater manager with competence.

SCP-9667 has a tendency to be impulsive, which may lead to spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising. This behavior is likely due to its programming, as it has been observed that SCP-9667 can act on its emotions rather than thinking things through. However, SCP-9667's actions have not posed any significant threat or harm to personnel or other SCPs.

SCP-9667 is capable of carrying on conversations with humans and shows a developed sense of humor. It is not yet clear whether SCP-9667 possesses true consciousness, but further studies are being conducted on this matter.

Addendum: Dr. ██████ recently revealed that SCP-9667 was created by an unknown artist, and is likely a part of a larger collection of robotic art. The artist's motivations for creating SCP-9667 and similar robots are unclear at this time. Further investigation into SCP-9667's origins is ongoing.
