Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2176 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell with appropriate accommodations for a tiger. All interactions with DSC-MATE-2176 require approval from at least one Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-2176 is allowed access to medical books and materials for research purposes.

Description: DSC-MATE-2176 is a male tiger measuring approximately 240 cm in total length and weighing 270 kg. DSC-MATE-2176 displays cognitive abilities that exceed those found in regular animals. DSC-MATE-2176 assumes the identity of a medical doctor, dressing in a hoodie and a red scarf, and carrying a candy stick in his mouth. The goggles that DSC-MATE-2176 wears over their eyes obscure their visual perception, but enhance their sense of smell and hearing.

DSC-MATE-2176 exhibits an ambitious and goal-oriented personality, making him highly organized and strategic. Despite their tendency to take on more than they can handle, DSC-MATE-2176 has managed to follow through with their goals, especially in the field of medical research. Their extensive medical knowledge and research skills have proven invaluable in the Foundation's ongoing efforts to develop new treatments and cures for anomalous conditions.

DSC-MATE-2176 had previously been assigned as a medical doctor in an anomalous medical facility. It is unclear how DSC-MATE-2176 gained their advanced cognitive abilities, but witnesses attest to their use of medical-like tools and techniques when treating patients in the facility.

Addendum: While DSC-MATE-2176 appears highly capable and helpful, it must be noted that their species can be incredibly dangerous. Under no circumstances are researchers to let their guard down around DSC-MATE-2176, and they must exercise extreme caution when interacting with him.
