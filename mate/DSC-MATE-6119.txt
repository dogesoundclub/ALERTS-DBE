Item #: SCP-6119

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6119 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with enriched environment appropriate for its species. The chamber must be equipped with a soundproofing system, as well as a remotely operated tranquilizer injection system, in case of aggression.

SCP-6119's medication must be administered daily to ensure its cooperation, and it must not be allowed access to any sharp or dangerous objects. SCP-6119 may be allowed access to books or other intellectually stimulating materials, as it has demonstrated a keen interest in literature.

Description: SCP-6119 is a male tiger wearing a bucket hat and a medical mask, with distinctive red clown eyes. The tiger displays an unusual physical trait in the form of a two-color band on its forehead, and a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-6119 demonstrates a highly analytical and logical personality trait, but with a quirky sense of humor that can be described as deadpan. It enjoys making witty observations and teasing its friends, although this behavior can be somewhat unsettling given its imposing and dangerous appearance.

SCP-6119's job as a lawyer is a useful tool to contain it within the Foundation, as it is an expert in negotiating on behalf of its clients. However, it must be reminded that it is not authorized to represent any other individual or organization outside of the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-6119 has been known to display aggressive behavior towards personnel it deems as disingenuous or duplicitous. Additionally, it has expressed an interest in pursuing romantic relationships with certain individuals, but this must be strictly monitored and controlled to prevent any unwanted incidents.
