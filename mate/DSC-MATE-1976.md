Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1976 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with access to a small private garden area. All communication must be conducted through a video monitoring system, as direct contact may induce severe anxiety and panic attacks.

Description: DSC-MATE-1976 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, measuring approximately 30cm in length and weighing 2kg. DSC-MATE-1976 has a frightened mouth typical of prey species and unusual ski goggle-shaped eyes. DSC-MATE-1976 is frequently seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a gold chain, and a whistle around their neck.

DSC-MATE-1976 displays an outgoing and social personality, often attempting to engage with personnel in conversation. DSC-MATE-1976 has a tendency to tell jokes and stories that are so humorous that they induce uncontrollable laughter in some individuals. This effect appears to be involuntary and has not been fully understood, though it could be a form of anomalous influence. Personnel are advised to exercise caution while conversing with DSC-MATE-1976, as its humor often masks its anxiety and fear.

DSC-MATE-1976 was previously employed as a real estate agent, a position from which it was terminated after a series of panic attacks and complaints from clients who found DSC-MATE-1976's behavior unsettling. DSC-MATE-1976's anomalous effects were discovered during a routine screening procedure conducted by the Foundation.
