Item #: 4085

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4085 is to be kept in a designated location at all times. No personnel are allowed to remove the item from its containment chamber without permission from O5 Command. The chamber must be inspected weekly for any signs of damage, and repairs should be done as needed. Item 4085 must be kept away from all fashion-related items as much as possible, to ensure its safety from any potential fashion accidents. Any signs of danger or disturbance should be reported to O5 Command immediately.

Description: Item 4085, also known as the Fashion Designer, is a human male of unknown age. The subject has a red victory band on its forehead, a jade earring in its left ear, and a silver chain hanging around its neck. The subject has a normal gas mask as a secondary accessory that it wears constantly. 4085 is often seen wearing formal or smart clothing that it designs by itself. The fashion designer resembles a normal human, but with a unique fashion taste.

Personality: Item 4085 is an independent individual who tends to work alone and doesn't ask for help, even when needed. This attribute could lead to amusing situations such as stubbornly moving heavy furniture alone or refusing to use a map when lost. Nonetheless, 4085 does have a dark and twisted personality and is known to seek revenge on individuals who disagree or criticize its fashion designs, causing them deadly harm. It is crucial that all personnel handle the subject with the utmost caution and avoid speaking negatively about its work, in fear of causing potential harm or death.

Addendum: Item 4085 was recovered from a high-end fashion show where it allegedly caused a fatal malfunction in the runway, killing multiple models and audience members. The item was quickly contained and transferred to a secure chamber. Since its containment, there have been no signs of life outside the chamber, but O5 Command remains cautious and monitors the object closely as it remains a potential threat to all individuals in close proximity.
