DSC-MATE-6480, designated as "The Empathetic Veterinarian," is a female human with unique physical features that distinguish her from the norm. Her skin is dotted with various spots, and her eyes are a bright, clownish red that emanates a sense of unease in those who meet her gaze. DSC-MATE-6480's head sports a flash of orange, which adds to her curious appearance. She's often seen wearing a choker and smoking a cigarette, both of which add to her rebellious aura.

However, do not be fooled by her appearance, for DSC-MATE-6480 possesses a deep empathy and understanding for others that is unmatched by most humans. She is often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing others' pain, and her fondness for animals and nature is widely known. Her empathetic nature makes her exceedingly useful in her job as a veterinarian, as she is able to connect with animals on a deep, emotional level.

DSC-MATE-6480's empathetic powers are yet to be explained fully. However, it is speculated that her unique physical features indicate a mutation in her brain's emotional centres. It is vital that DSC-MATE-6480 receives psychological support regularly, as her empathetic nature can cause a significant strain on her psychological wellbeing.

DSC-MATE-6480's gift undoubtedly makes her invaluable in the Foundation's work, but it's crucial to note that her emotional vulnerability must be handled with care. Please treat her with the utmost respect and understanding as you would with any other DSC.
