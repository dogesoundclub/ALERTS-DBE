Description: Item 2027 is a male firefighter robot with retro styling. It stands at 6'3" tall and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Item 2027 is capable of independent movement and possesses extraordinary strength, agility, and speed. Its frame is made of a lightweight metal alloy, and its programming is designed to mimic human behavior.

Item 2027's head is adorned with a retro cap with a jade earring on its left ear, and its eyes are covered by horned rim glasses. It wears a medical mask over its mouth, ostensibly to protect against smoke inhalation, but also serves to hide its robotic features from the public.

Personality: Item 2027 is programmed to have a love for adventure and taking risks. They enjoy trying new things and exploring new places, which has led to some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

Despite its playful nature, Item 2027 is fiercely loyal to its fellow firefighters and will stop at nothing to protect human life. When presented with a crisis situation, it will immediately react and work tirelessly to protect people and property.

Addendum: Item 2027 was recovered from a warehouse fire in downtown Detroit in 2016. Its creator, Dr. Gabriel Lewis, was found dead at the scene, and the cause of death was attributed to a heart attack. The motives for Dr. Lewis' creation of Item 2027 are currently unknown.
