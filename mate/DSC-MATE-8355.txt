Item #: SCP-8355

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8355 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with reinforced steel walls and a titanium door. The cell should be equipped with high-strength restraints and a tranquilizer dart system in case of emergency. Any interactions with SCP-8355 must be approved by at least two Level 2 personnel.

SCP-8355 must be kept in a constant state of sedation due to its highly volatile and aggressive nature. All feeding and waste disposal procedures should be carried out by a team of highly trained professionals in full body armor.

Description: SCP-8355 appears as a humanoid tiger with a frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes. It wears a blue bandana on its head and a red cross earring in its ears. It also sports a red scarf and is often seen holding a cigarette.

SCP-8355's personality is highly unpredictable and dangerous. It has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often taking on more than it can handle. This leads to situations where it tries to carry too many things at once or attempts to fit all of its tasks into a single day.

In addition, SCP-8355 displays highly aggressive behavior when provoked or threatened. It has been known to break through reinforced steel walls and attack personnel when its sedation is not properly maintained.

Notes: SCP-8355 was discovered working as a real estate agent in ██████. Its highly volatile nature was uncovered during a routine background check, leading to its immediate containment. Any attempts to hire SCP-8355 for employment must be strictly prohibited.
