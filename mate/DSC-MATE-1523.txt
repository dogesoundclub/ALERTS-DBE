Item #: SCP-1523

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1523 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any requests for additional accessories or items must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1523's police duties are to be limited and monitored carefully by Foundation personnel to ensure their abilities are not used to harm or expose SCPs or the Foundation. SCP-1523 is allowed only one cigarette per day, which is to be provided by research personnel at designated times.

Description: SCP-1523 appears to be a human female in her late thirties, measuring 1.65 meters in height and weighing approximately 67 kilograms. SCP-1523's most notable physical features are her purple lips, a purple cap with a headset, and a choker. Her forehead features a two-color band and goggles that are worn on her forehead. SCP-1523's ears are pierced and adorned with gold earrings. She is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1523's personality is often absent-minded and forgetful. She may miss appointments or forget important details due to her tendency to become lost in her thoughts while working on projects. Foundation personnel must closely monitor SCP-1523 to avoid any detrimental effects on her performance as a police officer.

SCP-1523's abilities as a police officer have been tested and proven to be highly effective. However, caution must be exercised to ensure that she does not accidentally expose Foundation secrets or put SCPs at risk.

Additional Notes: SCP-1523 has proven to be cooperative and easy to communicate with, but she shows a tendency to become easily distracted. Ongoing research is being conducted to determine whether this behavior is a side effect of her anomalous abilities or a part of her natural personality.
