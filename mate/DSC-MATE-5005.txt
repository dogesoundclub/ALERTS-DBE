Item #: SCP-5005

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5005 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must have a reinforced door and walls, and must be regularly inspected for any signs of damage caused by SCP-5005's frantic and occasionally violent outbursts. SCP-5005 is to be monitored through closed-circuit cameras at all times, and all interaction with it must be conducted by personnel wearing full protective gear.

Description: SCP-5005 is a male rabbit approximately 1.2 meters in height when standing upright, with a frightened mouth and eyes that have not yet been identified. SCP-5005 wears a bucket hat on its head, a jade earring in each ear, and a red victory band on its forehead. SCP-5005 is also commonly seen wearing a red scarf around its neck and carrying a candy stick in its right hand.

SCP-5005's most prominent characteristic is its scatterbrained personality. It has a tendency to forget things easily, get sidetracked while attempting to complete tasks, and become overwhelmed by even minor stressors. This has caused SCP-5005 to miss important appointments, get lost in unfamiliar locations, and become panicked during routine physical examinations.

However, SCP-5005's behavior can become more erratic and unpredictable when it is under intense stress, leading to violent outbursts and potentially dangerous situations for both itself and those around it.

Addendum: SCP-5005 was first discovered in City-███, when reports of a humanoid rabbit causing chaos in the local government were received by the Foundation. After several attempts to capture SCP-5005, it was eventually contained and transported to Site-██ for further study. SCP-5005's current status as a politician is under investigation, as it is unclear how it gained its position given its unpredictable behavior and lack of qualifications.
