Item #: SCP-7747

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7747 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Any medical assistance required by Foundation personnel is to be addressed through proper medical channels, and not through SCP-7747. Continuous monitoring of SCP-7747's workload is necessary to prevent overloading of tasks and avoid potential containment breaches.

Description: SCP-7747 appears to be a male human of average build with unique physical features. The subject has distinctive orange stripes on their face, and their head is parted pink in color. SCP-7747's red clown eyes are an abnormality, possibly indicating health issues.

SCP-7747's personality indicates a strong sense of responsibility and duty, often taking on more than they can handle. This can lead to humorous situations where SCP-7747 attempts to carry multiple items at once.

The subject's appearance also features a green cross earring and a gold chain around their neck. No anomalous effects have been observed from these accessories.

SCP-7747 is a practicing doctor and should not be utilized for medical assistance by Foundation personnel unless no other options are available.

Addendum: SCP-7747's physical features and medical condition require further research for potential anomalous effects. Update to containment procedures may be necessary after additional study.
