SCP-2719 is a robotic security guard who wears a blue bandana over his head and has a single green cyclops eye on the front of his face. He is often seen wearing a jade earring and a silver chain, which he uses to add to his already imposing presence. 

As a natural brainstormer, he thoroughly enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas, which can lead to some humorous situations. He has a tendency to suggest outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react, making him somewhat of a wildcard in a tense situation. 

However, he is also a highly trained security guard, and takes his job seriously. He's patient and level-headed, but will not hesitate to use force if necessary to protect his charges. His whistle is his go-to tool for alerting his fellow guards of danger or gathering attention from the public.

SCP-2719 is a formidable ally to have on your side in any situation, whether it be a simple security breach, or a full-scale battle against the forces of darkness. He is respected by his peers and feared by his enemies alike.
