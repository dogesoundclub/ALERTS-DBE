The chamber is to be cleared of all objects and tools which may be harmful or make repairable damage to the enclosure. The subject must be provided with a regular diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, and insects, given twice daily. Staff are prohibited from engaging with DSC-MATE-4019 in any way, other than those necessary for exercising basic care and proper feeding. Telecommunication with the event of scientific recordings or data reading is permitted. Any unauthorized access or interaction with DSC-MATE-4019 is strictly disallowed.

Description: DSC-MATE-4019 is a sapient monkey, confirmed to be a male of its species. It has a pair of horn-rimmed glasses grafted onto its anatomical structure to aid with their vision. The being's fur is distinguished by its green color that has not been arranged in a typical grooming style. Its forehead is marked with a double-colored band, indicating their matured age. The main characteristic of DSC-MATE-4019's appearance is their golden hoop earring and a thick gold chain with a small pendant worn around its neck.

DSC-MATE-4019 is a values-driven monkey that shows a perception of traditionalism and to uphold his community's values. It holds a conservative stance and may show a somewhat blunt attitude if their values and beliefs feel violated in any way. DSC-MATE-4019 enjoys light-hearted engagement, with displayed interest in storytelling and joking, as their playful side manifests. 

Addendum 1:

After conducting several interviews, DSC-MATE-4019 appears to be a skilled veterinary practitioner whereby subjects seem to possess certain abilities that involve an affinity to care for other animals. Its knowledge extends to unusual properties and features among the animal species, unknown to the average individual. Its interpersonal skills suggest they are proficient in communicating with an animal in a manner that exceeds the inherent communication gap between species. However, the exact origin of this skill is unknown. DSC-MATE-4019 refrains from any work requests or tasks assigned by Foundation staff, emphasizing their lack of trust and familiarity with unknown entities. 

Addendum 2:

As a result of testing, DSC-MATE-4019 has displayed the competency to perform surgical procedures on live animals. An interaction protocol is to be developed, which takes into consideration the use of DSC-MATE-4019's special abilities under controlled circumstances. If approved, these DSC-MATE-4019 may be permitted to work under the purview of staff with approval from Level 3 or above personnel.
