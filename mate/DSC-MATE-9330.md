Description: DSC-MATE-9330 is a talking, humanoid rabbit with blue clown eyes that stands at 1.5 meters. DSC-MATE-9330 is a male rabbit, who is currently employed as a news anchor. DSC-MATE-9330 is easily frightened and tends to present a horrified facial expression often resulting in flattened, alert ears and aggressive panting.

DSC-MATE-9330 is commonly found wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick. DSC-MATE-9330 often presents a goofy and playful personality that seems to seek social connections with others.

DSC-MATE-9330 has shown significant levels of empathy towards other humanoids, often mimicking psychological traits exhibited by those it is communicating with. DSC-MATE-9330's playful nature has led to DSC-MATE-9330 engaging in humorous situations, such as telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with other humanoids. Furthermore, DSC-MATE-9330 has been observed developing strong bonds with personnel on staff, often seeking their company when feeling distressed.

DSC-MATE-9330 has an acute susceptibility to external stimuli, and this unnerves and alarms DSC-MATE-9330, leading to a heightened state of anxiety.
