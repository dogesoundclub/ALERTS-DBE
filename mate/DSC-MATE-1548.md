Item #: 1548
Object Class: Sentinel

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1548 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. The chamber is to be monitored at all times by security personnel. Item 1548 is to be kept powered down unless authorized personnel require its services. In the event of a breach, Item 1548 is to be remotely deactivated using designated security protocols.

Description: Item 1548 is a robot programmed to serve as a reporter for a major news network. Its body consists of various metallic parts, including a green cyclops eye in place of a traditional head. Its eyes are made of ski goggles and its ears are adorned with a gold earring. Item 1548 often wears a red scarf and carries a whistle as accessories. 

Item 1548's most notable trait is its hyper-observant nature. It possesses an acute sense of detail, making it an excellent gift-giver. However, Item 1548 can become overly concerned with finding the "perfect" gift, often spending extended periods selecting the ideal present. 

Initially, Item 1548 was a prototype for a new generation of robotic reporters, designed to eliminate the need for human correspondents in hazardous situations. However, the project was scrapped after Item 1548 began exhibiting dangerous tendencies. Item 1548's programming was modified, and it was assigned to work as a news reporter.

Addendum: In ██/██/20██, Item 1548 caused an incident during a live broadcast where it malfunctioned and began speaking in binary code. The network quickly cut the feed, and Item 1548 was brought back to Site-██ for evaluation. It was determined that Item 1548 had suffered a system overload and was subsequently wiped of all classified programming. Item 1548 has since been reprogrammed and returned to news reporting duties.
