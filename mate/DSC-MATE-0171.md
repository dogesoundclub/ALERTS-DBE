Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 171, also known as "Goldie," has been deemed a potential anomaly due to their distinct appearance and unpredictable behavior. They must be kept under constant observation and monitored for any changes in behavior. All interactions with 171 must be approved by a Level 4 Senior Researcher.

Description: 171 is a human of the female sex, with blue clown eyes that seem to glow in the dark. They appear to be a throwback to 00s School Girl style with gold earrings, a gold chain, and a charming smile. Goldie is an electrician by trade and is known to exhibit erratic behavior at times. Despite this, they have a strong sense of duty and responsibility that they take seriously when working on electrical work sites.

Personality: Goldie's personality is a mixture of dedication and playfulness. They take pride in their work, but they also know how to enjoy life outside of work. They are not afraid to be silly and outrageous when the opportunity arises, leading to unexpected moments of hilarity. Goldie loves to dance at social events and can often be found on the dance floor, showing off their moves.

Addendum: Due to their unpredictable behavior, 171 has been denied access to any location where electrical equipment is present. Any attempts by 171 to access such sites must be reported immediately to the Site Director. Failure to comply with these procedures will result in disciplinary actions.
