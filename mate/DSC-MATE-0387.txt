Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 387 is to be contained in a secure underground facility located at an undisclosed location. All personnel must adhere to standard safety protocols and avoid physical contact with the entity. Communication with the entity must only take place through designated communication devices.

Description: Item 387 is a mafia boss of unknown origin and construction. Upon initial observation, it appears to be a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. It wears horned rim glasses and a jade earring on its left ear. Its mouth is usually covered by a medical mask, and it is known to accessorize with a silver chain.

Item 387 displays an unusual personality trait of valuing harmony and social connections. In spite of its role as a mafia boss, it has been observed to have a goofy side and engages in playful banter with others. It is often seen telling jokes and making humorous quips that can be perceived as inappropriate or insensitive.

Whilst the entity displays a relatively benign personality, it is crucial to note that it still holds significant sway within the criminal underworld. Any attempts to cross or undermine the entity's authority may result in severe repercussions, including bodily harm or death.

Addendum: Item 387's origins and construction remain a mystery. Further research into its capabilities and limitations is ongoing.
