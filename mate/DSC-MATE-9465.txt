Item #: SCP-9465


Object Class: Safe


Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9465 is to be contained in a typical rural farm setting, under the guise of being a normal, human farmer. As long as SCP-9465's orange-striped face and jade earring are covered, it is indistinguishable from a mundane human being. It is to be treated with the same level of respect as any non-anomalous person, and allowed to carry out farming activities as usual.


Description: SCP-9465 is a human male with striking facial features. It has orange stripes on its face and a wide, friendly smile, and sports a green mohawk. SCP-9465's forehead features a black and white band and a pair of goggles on its forehead, and often wears a gold chain around its neck. It also wears a modified LED gas mask whenever it is not in the presence of others.


SCP-9465 has a commanding and assertive personality, often perceived as intimidating or bossy by others. This is due to its keen desire to ensure that things are done efficiently and correctly. Though perceived this way, SCP-9465 is still quite friendly and approachable when not in its professional state.


SCP-9465 is a successful farmer, able to cultivate crops that are out of season or at unprecedented rates. It is hypothesized that this is due to its anomalous properties, but further testing is required.


Addendum: SCP-9465 harbors a deep dislike for authority figures and does not always adhere to the Foundation's instructions. This behavior is to be monitored by Security Personnel to ensure operational security.
