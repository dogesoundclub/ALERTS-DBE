SCP-8241's most distinctive feature is the normal gas mask that she wears over her face at all times.

SCP-8241's personality tends to be very introspective, and she can often be found lost in thought or daydreaming. This can lead to some humorous situations where SCP-8241 may accidentally walk into a pole or trip over something while lost in thought. Despite her absentmindedness, SCP-8241 is a highly competent firefighter and is known for her bravery and quick thinking in emergency situations.

SCP-8241 has displayed some anomalous abilities, including the ability to withstand extreme heat and smoke inhalation. However, these abilities have yet to be fully understood or documented.

SCP-8241 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation's firefighting team and has saved numerous lives in the line of duty.
