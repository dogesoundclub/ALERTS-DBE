SCP-2930, also known as Officer Bananas, is a remarkable specimen of the monkey species. With his piercing red clown eyes, he keeps a watchful eye on the city streets from his goggle-equipped forehead. This curious cop never walks his beat without his trusty gold earring dangling from his ear and his cozy red scarf wrapped around his neck.

Officer Bananas is known for his forgetfulness; thankfully, his enthusiasm and intelligence more than make up for this flaw. He is often found completely enamored in his police work, forgetting the time he was supposed to go home, or even to eat dinner. SCP-2930's drive and dedication to his job are an inspiration to all his human colleagues.

Despite his scattered nature, Officer Bananas has proven himself a valuable asset to the police department. His species' agility and dexterity make him a formidable force in chasing down criminals and scaling tall buildings. And as for his personality, he's a good-natured soul with a heart of gold. SCP-2930's presence is a breath of fresh air, and his infectious laughter can light up even the darkest corners of the city.
