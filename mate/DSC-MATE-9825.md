Item #: 9825

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject known as 9825, or "the Rabbit Politician," is to be regularly monitored and kept under constant surveillance by undercover agents of the Foundation's "Urban Myth" department. While it is believed that the rabbit in question does not possess any anomalous abilities, its status and position as a politician have not yet been fully explored. Thus, any and all attempts to set up an interview or hold a conversation with the subject may provoke a negative response.

Description: 9825 is a male rabbit species, standing at approximately 3 feet tall. Its body weight and features are mostly consistent with that of a regular rabbit, save for the distinguishing accessories it habitually wears. 9825 sports a stylish bucket hat that blends seamlessly with its fur, adorned with a gold earring on its left ear. Its eyes are covered by horn-rimmed glasses, which offer no tell-tale sign of any peculiarity within its body. Finally, the rabbit politician carries a large candy stick - the attribute acting both as an accessory and a quirk.

Personality: 9825's personality is a curious and fascinating blend of organizational skills, officious duties, and amusing shortcomings. Despite its position, the rabbit is assumed to have little to no impact on the city's politics. Regardless, the subject appears to demonstrate an unwavering sense of responsibility and duty, often taking on more than it can handle. The quirk culminates in frequent comical calamities, such as the inability to finish all the day's work within a specified time frame or trying to carry too many things at once.

Addendum: Recent surveillance photos reveal that 9825 may have a fascination with carrots. Although this discovery may seem insignificant, it has sparked speculation that the subject's political positions may be a thinly-veiled allegory, hinting at more obscure laws or customs. Investigation into this theory is ongoing.
