Item #: 2411

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2411 should be stationed in a discrete location within the Traffic Control Division of the local law enforcement agency on a rotational basis to prevent undue notice of its anomalous qualities. A limited access protocol is to be established, and no civilian is permitted to operate or interact with SCP-2411 except during emergency situations. 

Description: SCP-2411 is a male monkey of undetermined sub-species serving as a Traffic Officer for the local law enforcement division. SCP-2411 measures at 30 cm in height and weighs approximately 1.5 kg. SCP-2411 possess round eyes similar to ski goggles along with pink parted head, gold chain and normal gas mask as accessories. Through external observation, SCP-2411 appears to employ standard protocol and behavior of a traffic officer which makes it difficult to identify as anomalous. 

Despite initial assumptions of no anomalous qualities, after observing SCP-2411 for a significant amount of time, it became apparent that  SCP-2411 posses a strong sense of intuition and may sometimes seem like they have psychic powers. SCP-2411 may be able to predict things before they happen or sense when someone is feeling upset or anxious, which can be impressive and a bit eerie. 

SCP-2411 has displayed no signs of aggression or intentions to harm anyone at this time. Low-level stressor tests have yielded no conclusive evidence of anomalous qualities beyond the initial psychic tendencies SCP-2411 displays. 

Addendum: SCP-2411 was discovered during routine monitoring of anomalous activity occurring in the vicinity of the local law enforcement division. An investigation was conducted, and SCP-2411 was identified and subsequently contained. Further studies are still forthcoming.
