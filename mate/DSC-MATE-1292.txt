No personnel are to engage in direct contact with the subject without prior authorization from at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-1292 is a middle-aged human male identified as the manager of a local theater in [REDACTED], USA. The subject measures approximately 170cm in height with a distinctly spotted face and a constant smile. SCP-1292's eyes are anomalously colored with an iridescent, virtual reality jade LED glow, which shifts color inexplicably, seemingly reflecting the individual's emotional state. SCP-1292 habitually accessorizes with a Doge hat and a jade earring, as well as a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-1292 exhibits an unusually deep emotional capacity, principally moved by other individuals' distress, often to the point of public emotional outbursts that have led to several containment breaches. Reports suggest the subject has an unwavering affinity for animals and nature, often exhibiting profound connection to plant life and even insects.

SCP-1292 has presented no overtly harmful behavior, although repeated relief efforts for the most vulnerable around the subject should be prioritized to prevent a potential emotional drain on SCP-1292, resulting in an uncontrolled emotional outburst.

*Note: Due to SCP-1292's emotional reactivity, personnel should be discreet when reporting and discussing SCP-1292 in the presence of the subject. Any mishandling of the subject's potential emotional distress may result in a containment breach.
