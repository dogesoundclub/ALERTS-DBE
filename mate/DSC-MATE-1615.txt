Item #: SCP-1615

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1615 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-1615 is restricted to Level 2 personnel with approval from at least one Level 3 officer. SCP-1615 must wear its LED gas mask at all times outside of its containment chamber.

Description: SCP-1615 is a humanoid entity, appearing to be a male in his late thirties. SCP-1615 is approximately 185 cm tall and weighs 72 kg. SCP-1615 has distinctive facial features, including multiple spots on its face and a parted pink hairstyle. SCP-1615 wears nerd glasses and a red victory band on its forehead, as well as a goggle atop its forehead to keep its hair out of its eyes. SCP-1615 has one gold earring in its left ear and often wears a red scarf.

SCP-1615 is an accomplished doctor and is particularly skilled in the field of emergency medicine. SCP-1615 has a strong sense of duty and a deep commitment to helping others. This sometimes leads SCP-1615 to take on more than it can handle, resulting in humorous situations such as simultaneously carrying too many items or being unable to complete its tasks in a single day.

SCP-1615 has a unique ability to detect abnormal medical conditions in humans and other humanoids. This ability appears to be intrinsic and unrelated to its training or experience. SCP-1615 has not exhibited any other abilities or anomalies.

Addendum: SCP-1615 was recovered by Foundation personnel after being involved in a traffic accident where it displayed its anomalous ability for the first time. A full investigation into SCP-1615's background and abilities is ongoing.
