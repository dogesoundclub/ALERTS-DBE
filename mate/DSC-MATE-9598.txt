Item #: SCP-9598

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9598 is to be kept under constant surveillance by at least two armed guards at all times. It is to be housed in a contained, fire-retardant chamber with reinforced walls and floors. SCP-9598 must not have access to any flammable or explosive materials under any circumstances.

SCP-9598 is to be fed twice a day and is allowed limited recreational activities within its chamber, subject to approval by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-9598 appears to be a human female in her early thirties with bright orange stripes on her arms and legs. Her eyes resemble those of clowns, with blue irises and large pupils. Her head is adorned with a rainbow-colored festival hood and a pair of goggles rests on her forehead. SCP-9598 wears a gold chain as an accessory and a normal gas mask for protection.

SCP-9598's personality is described as scatterbrained, and she tends to forget things easily. This often leads her to get sidetracked, causing her to get lost or forget important appointments.

SCP-9598's anomalous abilities manifest when she comes into contact with fire. She appears to have a natural affinity for flames and can manipulate them to do her bidding. SCP-9598 has been observed creating complex shapes and patterns with fire, as well as controlling its intensity and movement. It is believed that SCP-9598 obtained these abilities through exposure to a previously unknown anomalous substance.

SCP-9598's abilities are dangerous both to herself and to those around her, as she has been observed creating large fires that can quickly spread and become uncontainable. She has caused multiple incidents at her previous place of employment as a firefighter, resulting in the deaths of several civilians.

Addendum: Due to SCP-9598's abilities, testing and research must be conducted with extreme caution. Any use of fire as a testing element must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel and requires the presence of at least two armed guards. Any incidents or breaches involving SCP-9598 must be reported immediately to Site-██.
