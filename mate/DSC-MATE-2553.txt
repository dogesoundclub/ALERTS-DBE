Researchers have noted that SCP-2553's unique ability can potentially cause individuals to become attached or obsessed with SCP-2553. SCP-2553 must be kept under strict containment to prevent any possible incidents.

Addendum:

SCP-2553 was initially brought to the Foundation's attention after a series of disappearances in a local theater where SCP-2553 worked as the manager. Foundation operatives discovered SCP-2553 using its abilities to lure individuals into a secluded area of the theater, leading to their eventual disappearance.

SCP-2553 was secured without incident and transferred to Foundation custody. It is believed that SCP-2553 has been responsible for a significant number of unexplained disappearances within the local area. Further investigation is ongoing.
