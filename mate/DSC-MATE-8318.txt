SCP Foundation Description:

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8318 is to be kept under surveillance at all times and monitored for any unusual behavior. Should it attempt to leave its designated property, Foundation personnel are to intervene immediately and assess the situation before taking appropriate measures. Contact with SCP-8318 should be limited and monitored to prevent any breaches in confidentiality.

Description:

SCP-8318 is a human male of average height and build, with distinct orange stripes on their face. Their eyes resemble ski goggles, and their head is covered in a metallic purple substance. SCP-8318 has a pair of gold earrings and wears a gold chain around their neck. It is often seen with a cigarette in its mouth.

Despite its unusual appearance, SCP-8318 exhibits personality traits consistent with caring and nurturing behaviors. It is often observed taking care of its friends and family members as if they were its own children, which has led to some humorous situations. SCP-8318 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and appears to enjoy human interaction, although it has been known to become defensive if it feels its loved ones are threatened.

SCP-8318 works as a farmer and spends much of its time tending to crops and livestock. It has expressed a particular fondness for animals and is known to go to great lengths to ensure their well-being, sometimes at the expense of its own health and safety.

Addendum:

SCP-8318 has requested access to a small garden space for personal use within its containment area, which has been granted with appropriate precautions to prevent any escape attempts. The garden has been observed to have a calming effect on SCP-8318's demeanor, making it easier for Foundation personnel to collect information and conduct research.
