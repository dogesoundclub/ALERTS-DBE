Item #: 8616

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8616 is to be allowed to work remotely as a programmer from her home. Any and all inanimate objects within her vicinity are to be inspected regularly to ensure that SCP-8616 has not anthropomorphized them. In the event that SCP-8616 has formed a bond with an object, measures are to be taken to ensure that said object is not removed from her possession.

Description: SCP-8616 is a human female with distinctive facial features including orange stripes on the cheek area and red lips. SCP-8616 habitually wears a medical mask covering her mouth, and a blond Ushanka hat adorned with a two-color band on her forehead, both of which she considers to be sentient entities.

SCP-8616's personality is characterized by a highly nurturing and caring nature. She has been observed assigning names to her computer, her car, and her plants, and frequently talks to them out loud as if they were people. SCP-8616 has also been observed anthropomorphizing mundane household objects such as toasters, light fixtures, and even furniture.

SCP-8616's Jade Earrings are of particular interest to the Foundation, as they have been observed to emit a low-level radiation signature. Investigation into the source and properties of this radiation is ongoing.

SCP-8616's programming skills make her a valuable asset to the Foundation, and her remote work status allows for her to safely perform her duties while minimizing the risk of accidental object-bonding.

Addendum: Should it be determined that SCP-8616 is unable to separate herself from an anthropomorphized object, the Foundation may consider offering a job as a caretaker for sentient objects within containment facilities.
