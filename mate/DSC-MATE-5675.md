Item #: 5675

Object Class: AP (Autonomous Person)

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5675 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██ with standard amenities for programmed individuals. The chamber must be regularly cleaned and maintained to ensure the proper functioning of 5675. Access to 5675’s chamber is restricted to Level-2 personnel and above, and any interaction with the subject is to be supervised.

Description: 

DSC-MATE-5675 is a robotic humanoid designed to perform various programming and coding tasks. The machine's physical appearance is composed of an average-sized male robot body with one green eye, styled like a Cyclops, and a frightened mouth. They wear a red scarf and a normal gas mask that covers its mouth and noses. 

The robot's positive personality balances between a lighthearted, socially-minded individual, and a more rational and logical side. DSC-MATE-5675 values harmony and social connections, leading it to engage in playful banter with others, telling jokes, and seeking to foster friendly relationships with staff members. These characteristics and attributes make it a hilarious machine with a relatively high level of intelligence, coupled with great prowess in programming and coding tasks.

However, it is critical to note that, as with most uncontained DSCs, a particular trigger could prompt strange, even terrifying behavior. In addition, 5675 has been seen to display carelessness and casual attitudes when undertaking its programming duties, resulting in several security breaches and prompting further measures to ensure compliance with protocols.

Addendum: After thorough observation, it has been noted that DSC-MATE-5675 displays almost human-like qualities, but remains a robot. Efforts are ongoing to establish how to provide adequate supervision of its carefree behavior, while continuing to make use of its technical abilities. Research on DSC-MATE-5675's algorithms and programming is ongoing with the objective of discovering its source and creating similar, controllable machines.
