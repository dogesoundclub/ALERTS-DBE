Item #: 6004

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The subject designated as 6004 is currently employed as a car salesman at a local dealership within the city limits. They are to be monitored for any unusual activity and supervised to ensure they do not draw attention to themselves or expose their unique features to the public. Any deviations from normal patterns of behavior should be reported immediately to the Foundation for further investigation.

Description: 6004 is a human male of average height and weight with a distinctive face that is marked with spots. They possess blue clown eyes and often don a short peak cap with a gold earring on their left ear. They are frequently seen with a silver chain around their neck and a candy stick in their mouth. Although they appear to be a typical car salesman, 6004 exhibits an unusual attention to detail that can become obsessive at times. This trait is noticeable in their meticulous organization of everyday items, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet.

Personality: Despite their seemingly mundane occupation, 6004 exhibits several personality traits that make them a valuable asset to the Foundation. Their attention to detail and analytical mind have proven useful in identifying anomalous patterns in the environment. Additionally, their quirkiness and unique features provide them with a certain degree of charm that can be used to gain the trust of potential informants.

Addendum: 6004 has expressed an interest in becoming more involved with the Foundation and has submitted a request to join one of our field teams. While their enthusiasm is appreciated, their involvement in any Foundation activities should be approved and monitored by senior staff.
