Item #: 2026

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2026 is to be kept in a temperature-controlled environment of no less than 25°C. The containment chamber should be no smaller than 10 x 10 meters, and contain at least 3 meters of reinforced steel as a barrier from the outside world. Access to DSC-MATE-2026's chamber must be authorized by at least two level 4 personnel. DSC-MATE-2026 must be sedated before handling.

Description: DSC-MATE-2026 is a male Siberian tiger, weighing approximately 250 kg, standing at 1.5 meters tall. DSC-MATE-2026 is distinguishable by its golden earring on its left ear and a silver chain around its neck. It wears a medical mask on its mouth, the reason for which is unknown. DSC-MATE-2026's eye color is unknown due to its refusal to open its eyes in the presence of Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-2026 possesses a strong and decisive personality, which is noticeable even when sedated. It can come across as bossy or intimidating, but it's all with the intention of ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.

DSC-MATE-2026 is capable of communicating in English and shows a high level of intelligence, seemingly far beyond that of a normal tiger. It has not displayed any anomalous abilities as of yet, but it is to be considered a potential danger to Foundation personnel and those who encounter it.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Level 4 personnel attempted to remove DSC-MATE-2026 from its containment chamber for routine maintenance. DSC-MATE-2026 managed to escape its chamber and eluded capture for 6 hours before being found in the cafeteria, calmly sitting and waiting for food. DSC-MATE-2026 was re-contained without incident and additional security measures were implemented to prevent further breaches.
