Item #: SCP-3183

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3183 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██ without access to any gift-giving materials or tools.

Description: SCP-3183 appears to be a female human with purple lipstick wearing normal glasses and sporting pig tails. The subject possesses a goggle on their forehead and can often be seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-3183 is a fashion designer by profession and exhibits a keen sense of observation and attention to detail. This trait is often expressed in their gift-giving tendencies as they strive to give the “perfect” gift to others, often spending an excessive amount of time and energy on gift selection.

SCP-3183’s gift-giving abilities have been known to cause anxiety in themselves and others due to their unyielding desire for perfection. Instances of gift-related hysteria have been reported involving SCP-3183, although these have been remedied with sedatives and therapy.

Despite their gift-related compulsions, SCP-3183 has shown to possess no anomalous abilities or traits outside of their gift-centric behavior. SCP-3183 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, and has not displayed any resistance to containment procedures.

Addendum: As of Incident ██-██-████, SCP-3183 has been prohibited from gift-giving activities and all gift materials and tools have been confiscated from their containment facility. SCP-3183 remains under surveillance and periodic psychological evaluations are to be administered to monitor their gift-giving tendencies.
