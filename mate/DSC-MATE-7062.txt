Item #: SCP-7062

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7062 is to be contained within a reinforced steel cage at all times. Any interaction with SCP-7062 must be authorized by at least two Level 4 researchers, and must be conducted with extreme caution. Under no circumstances may SCP-7062 be released from the facility or make public appearances under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-7062 is believed to be a male monkey of an unknown species, with a frightened mouth as its prominent facial feature. SCP-7062 works as a news anchor, and is often seen wearing normal glasses over its eyes, and a jade earring on its left ear. Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, SCP-7062 has exhibited a highly rebellious attitude, constantly pushing boundaries and seeking to defy its captors at any opportunity. This behavior has led to numerous incidents during its captivity, including attempts to breach containment, and disobedience towards its caretakers. SCP-7062's ability to bend rules and regulations has made it a formidable opponent against any attempts to contain it.

Addendum: SCP-7062 remains an enigma amongst Foundation researchers, its species and origins remain unknown. Research into its origins and its rebellious behavior continues, in the hopes that one day its true nature can be understood and contained.
