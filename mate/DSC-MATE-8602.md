Item #: 8602

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8602 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell which has been modified to accommodate the animalistic tendencies of the subject. The cell is to be constructed with strong and durable materials, and reinforced with advanced locking systems to prevent unauthorized entry.

Description: DSC-MATE-8602 appears to be a monkey of an unknown species. Its eyes are currently unknown, and it displays a parted pink head and a gold earring on one ear. An LED gas mask has been incorporated as an accessory, while a goggle is attached to the forehead. DSC-MATE-8602's personality traits are highly organized, leading to it being an efficient taskmaster, like a farmer leading a herd of animals.

Despite its animalistic nature, DSC-MATE-8602 is highly intelligent and shows an advanced ability to plan and organize tasks. It has been observed leading groups of people and delegating tasks to others in a highly authoritative and controlled manner. This has led to humorous moments, such as commanding the group with the same mannerisms as a farmer leading a field of crops.

Addendum: Further investigation into DSC-MATE-8602 has revealed that it has an advanced level of intelligence, surpassing most primates of its apparent species. It is highly likely that DSC-MATE-8602 possesses abilities and traits not seen in any other known primate. Further research is ongoing.
