Item #: SCP-7223

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7223 is currently contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The subject is to be provided with necessary amenities and monitored via closed-circuit television at all times. Any emotional outbursts or disturbances are to be reported to onsite personnel immediately. Requests for additional emotional stimuli are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Description: SCP-7223, previously identified as [REDACTED], is a male human of average height and weight. The subject's most distinctive feature is the use of nerd glasses as their ocular aid, and a bucket hat on their head. Subject's style is consistent in a casual urban fashion with a gold chain as an accessory. SCP-7223 is a beautician by trade and has demonstrated a high level of skill in hair and makeup design.

SCP-7223 is highly emotional and easily affected by stimuli that induce emotion. The subject becomes easily emotional while watching movies or tv shows that contain sentimental, romantic, or emotional scenes. Additionally, the subject has a deep fondness for music and art that evoke strong feelings. Further observation has shown that SCP-7223's emotional responses can be classified as heightened and intense.

SCP-7223 has shown a high level of cooperation with onsite personnel during containment but often requests additional emotional stimuli in the form of music or art to enhance their emotions.

Addendum: SCP-7223 has expressed a desire to provide hair and makeup design services to other SCP subjects. In light of the potential risks and possible emotional reactions, this request has been denied. SCP-██ has been tasked to investigate possible uses of SCP-7223's abilities.
