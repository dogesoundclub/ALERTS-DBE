SCP Foundation Report: 488- The Tiger Beautician

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-488 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with access to beauty care products and tools necessary for their profession. Any individuals subject to treatment by SCP-488 must be under surveillance at all times. SCP-488 is to be regularly fed a diet consisting of raw meat and water.

Description: SCP-488 is a male tiger with blue clown eyes and wears a bucket hat on its head. SCP-488's forehead features a red victory band and a goggle is strapped onto its forehead. SCP-488 wears a gold earring in its ear and carries a whistle as an accessory.

SCP-488 poses as a beautician, exhibiting a natural charm and charisma that is highly effective in attracting clients. SCP-488's humor is a particular characteristic of its personality that often puts clients at ease. SCP-488's treatment methods are yet to be fully understood as its methods have shown varying degrees of effectiveness, with some clients exhibiting exceptional beauty results, while others have reported extreme physical side effects, such as mutations in facial features.

SCP-488's intelligence level is equivalent to that of a human, allowing it to communicate effectively with individuals of other species. SCP-488's behavior is highly unpredictable, and it is recommended that all interactions with this subject are conducted with caution.

Addendum: Despite SCP-488's charismatic personality, it is unknown whether SCP-488 poses a risk to the Foundation due to its inability to differentiate between dangerous and non-dangerous situations. Further research is required to fully understand the extent of SCP-488's abilities and to identify potential security risks. Until then, the subject will remain under observation in accordance with Foundation protocol.
