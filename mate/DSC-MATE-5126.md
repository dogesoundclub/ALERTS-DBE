Subject 5126, also known as the "Curious Car Salesman," is a female human who stands out from the typical salespersons with her orange-striped face and a pair of striking orange eyebrows that accentuate her tendency to flash a wide, beaming smile. Dressed in a bucket hat and sporting a red cross earring, the subject also has a unique 2 colored band on her forehead and wears a choker as her signature accessory. 

Despite her human appearance, the subject's curiosity seems to be anything but human. Her almost insatiable thirst for knowledge extends to obscure or unusual topics that others may not find interesting, which often results in her spouting random facts or trivia to others. Her eagerness to learn about the unknown and her ability to find humor in unconventional places makes her a fascinating character in the urban fantasy world. 

Approach with caution and do not underestimate her wit and charm, as her curiosity can also lead her down dangerous paths. It is advised to maintain a professional distance while interacting with subject 5126 but be prepared to be dazzled by her unique perspective on the world.
