SCP-7538, codenamed "The Tiger Beautician," is a male tiger with green hair, wearing a purple cap adorned with a goggle on his forehead. He also wears a jade earring and a medical mask over his mouth. SCP-7538 is a beautician by trade, often frequented by upscale clients.

SCP-7538 is a very observant and attentive individual, never missing a detail when it comes to his work. His keen eye for detail makes him an excellent gift-giver, catering to the specific needs and desires of his clients. However, it is noted that SCP-7538 can sometimes be overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift, spending hours agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-7538's species and appearance are still being studied, as his physical attributes differ from ordinary tigers. SCP Foundation researchers are working to uncover the source of his unique abilities, including the ability to tailor gift-giving to such a high degree. It is advised to approach SCP-7538 with caution, as his motives and abilities are not yet fully understood.
