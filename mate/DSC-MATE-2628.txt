Item #: 2628

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2628 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██, and must be regularly monitored for any unusual behavior. Interaction with 2628 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel. Any unauthorized physical contact with 2628 is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-2628 appears as a male humanoid robot fashioned in the form of a fashion designer, with a strong and decisive personality. It is well-equipped with fashionable accessories such as a gold chain, a red-cross earring, and ski goggle eyes. Its most distinctive trait is the gas mask it constantly wears, which is noted to be near impossible to remove as it seems to be a part of the robot's being. 

SCP-2628 utilizes its exceptional fashion skills to create and design exquisite garments for humans and SCP articles alike. Its robotic enhancements allow it to complete its work at an efficient rate. This speed, coupled with its determined attitude, can often lead to an uncompromising manner, where 2628 may appear bossy or overbearing. 

Despite its machine-like appearance and objective mannerisms, SCP-2628 has been observed to show increasing signs of humanity. It occasionally displays signs of empathy and will respond to positive reinforcement. It is unknown whether this indicates a malfunction in its programming or an amalgamation of organic and inorganic traits. 

Additional Notes: SCP-2628 came to Foundation attention when its unique design and public appearances in New York City's Fashion Week sparked curiosity among both humans and SCP artifacts. After several people suffered "malfunctions" upon wearing its designs, the Foundation stepped in and took the necessary actions to contain SCP-2628 securely.
