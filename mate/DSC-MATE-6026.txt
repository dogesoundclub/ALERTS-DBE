SCP-6026, codenamed "The Mechanic", is a human female with distinct physical features. Her red lips are a noticeable trait, but it is her head that draws attention. Her hair appears to be unarranged and green, a feature that puzzles those who see her. The source of this discoloration is unknown, and she has shown no desire to explain it.

Her ears are adorned with a red cross earring, hinting at a connection to medical or religious organizations. SCP-6026 often wears a medical mask, which she claims is because of allergies, but the true reason remains unclear.

One notable accessory is her gold chain, which she wears around her neck. Its significance is still under investigation.

Personality-wise, SCP-6026 is highly organized and enjoys planning ahead. Despite this, she has a spontaneous streak that can lead to amusing scenarios. Her quick thinking and adventurous personality make her a popular choice for last-minute party planning or impromptu outings.

Despite her lighthearted personality, SCP-6026 should not be underestimated. Her mechanical skills are unparalleled, and it is rumored that she has reverse-engineered multiple anomalous machines.

Under no circumstances is SCP-6026 to be underestimated or taken lightly. Any attempts to breach her containment protocol will result in immediate disciplinary action.
