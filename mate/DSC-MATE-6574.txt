Item #: 6574

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6574 is to be kept in a standard animal containment chamber, reinforced with anti-teleportation wards, located in a secure facility at all times. Any interaction with 6574 is to be carried out by Foundation personnel of Level 2 clearance or higher with a background in animal handling.

Description: 6574 is a male rabbit with a unique hooded sweatshirt in shades of black and white. The sweatshirt has a two-color band on the forehead area, which serves as a distinctive identification feature. The rabbit's eyes are unknown due to the hood. It is also known to possess a whistle as an accessory, which it uses to attract attention for unspecified reasons.

Personality: Being a malevolent entity, 6574 exhibits an unusual personality for a rabbit. It is highly analytical and logical, with a penchant for arguing and debate, even in situations where that may be inappropriate or unnecessary. This has led to a few comical instances where the rabbit engages in heated debates on trivial topics or issues deemed unimportant by its opponents. Due to its intelligence and analytical capabilities, it is also a master strategist and is likely to come up with ingenious plans to escape its containment.

Note: No personnel should attempt to engage in a debate with 6574 unless authorized to do so by the Site Director.
