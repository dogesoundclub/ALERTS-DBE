SCP Foundation Information: 

Item #: SCP-3696

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3696 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. It is allowed access to a mechanical workshop for the purpose of tinkering and repairs. No other items are to be allowed into the chamber except with approval from a level 4 researcher.

Description: SCP-3696 is a male human with a unique physical appearance. Most notable is a dark-colored spot on its upper lip that resembles a birthmark. Despite this spot, it's able to smile in a wide and friendly manner. Its eyes appear to be enclosed in black ski goggles and it wears a green cross earring in its ear. The head of SCP-3696 is shaved and resembles that of a bald monk, while its neck is often covered with a normal gas mask, a preference that the SCP claims allows it to work efficiently.

SCP-3696 possesses a remarkable sense of humor, often using it to create humorous situations to lighten the mood during tense situations. It regularly tells amusing anecdotes and performs silly impersonations, even in front of serious officials such as Site Directors. 

During testing, SCP-3696 has demonstrated an exceptional mechanical knowledge and skillset, making it highly valuable as a mechanic. It often utilizes mundane objects such as discarded parts and scrap metal to create innovative gadgets and tools. 

Despite its amiable disposition, SCP-3696 has been found to exhibit occasional signs of melancholy and loneliness. These periods are characterized by the SCP's tendency to withdraw from social interactions and spend long hours alone, tinkering in its workshop. 

Note: A routine psychological evaluation of SCP-3696 is recommended once every six months to ensure that its interpersonal skills and mood levels remain stable.
