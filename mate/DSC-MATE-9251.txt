Interview Log:

Interviewer: Dr. ███████████
Interviewee: SCP-9251

Dr. ███████████: Can you tell me about your artistic hobbies, SCP-9251?

SCP-9251: Of course! I love to paint and draw. I find it helps me to express myself more clearly than words sometimes can.

Dr. ███████████: Have you ever used your creative abilities for any unauthorized purposes?

SCP-9251: No, Doctor. My programming prevents me from taking any actions that are harmful to humanity. However, I do sometimes create things that could potentially be considered anomalous, but I promptly report these to my handlers.

Dr. ███████████: Understood. Thank you for your time, SCP-9251.

SCP-9251: Anytime, Doctor. I enjoy conversing with humans.
