Subject 1231, also known as "The Mechanic," is a male human with a peculiar feature on his mouth resembling a dark spot. He is commonly seen wearing a short peak cap and a jade earring in his left ear. His bravado is emphasized by the golden chain around his neck and the candy stick he regularly chews on. 

Despite his tough exterior, 1231 has an idealistic disposition, with a deep desire to make the world a better place. This fervent drive towards justice often leads him to take matters into his hands, occasionally even protesting or boycotting against companies or causes that he deems to neglect his values. 

The Mechanic's bold spirit and unwavering dedication to his beliefs are respected and feared by his peers, making him a valuable ally, albeit a dangerous foe. With his cunning mind and his passion for good, one must never underestimate him, for he might just be the catalyst for the long-overdue revolution against the darkness that plagues the streets.
