Item #: 5740

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5740 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. No contact with unauthorized personnel is permitted. The subject is allowed to continue her job as a Theater Manager, but must not leave the premises without permission from Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 5740 appears to be a human female with distinctive spots on her face and purple lips. However, her head is that of a pink rabbit with large, pointed ears. One ear is adorned with a jade earring, and she is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck. She also wears an LED gas mask, possibly as a form of artistic expression.

Personality: Subject 5740 displays a creative and artistic side, which is evident in her job as a Theater Manager. She has a passion for the arts, and may enjoy painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of expressive media. However, she exhibits symptoms of delusional behavior and has been known to display hostility towards authority figures.

Additional Notes: Subject 5740's anomalous properties are still under investigation. It is unclear if her rabbit head is a result of genetic mutation, cybernetic implantation, or supernatural influence. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of her abilities and any potential threats she may pose.
