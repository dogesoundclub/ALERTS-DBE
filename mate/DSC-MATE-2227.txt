Item #: SCP-2227

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2227 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Daily sessions with a certified psychiatrist are mandatory to contain any impulsive behavior. As of Incident 2227-██, smoking materials are not allowed within a 10-meter radius of SCP-2227's containment chamber.

Description: SCP-2227 is a human female, 25 years of age, with distinct facial features. SCP-2227 has spots covering both cheeks and a red lip. The eyes are fitted with VR Rainbow LED contact lenses, further enhancing their distinct look. SCP-2227's head is adorned with a tiara and sports jade earrings on both ears. SCP-2227 is often seen smoking a cigarette and engaging in spontaneous decision-making.

SCP-2227's impulse control issues make it difficult to predict their behavior. SCP-2227 is prone to act on emotions rather than rational thought, leading to unexpected and often amusing outcomes. This behavior has been observed within work settings or social situations.

SCP-2227's conversation is often profane and may be aggressive in nature. It may be difficult for some personnel to communicate with SCP-2227. SCP-2227 has been known to have strong opinions on various subjects and is not reluctant to voice them, regardless of other people's opinions.

Addendum 2227-01: On ██/██/20██, SCP-2227 was observed leaving its containment chamber without authorization. SCP-2227 managed to break containment and flee the facility before re-containment was established. SCP-2227 was apprehended by the city police department two days later, after causing minor damage at a local fast-food restaurant. SCP-2227 was returned to Site-███ and containment procedures updated.
