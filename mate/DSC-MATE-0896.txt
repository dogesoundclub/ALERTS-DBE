Description: SCP-896 is a sapient male Bengal Tiger. It stands at an average of 3 meters in length and weighs approximately 200 kg. SCP-896 is notable for its unusual eyes; its irises are uniformly blue in color and appear to be clown make-up. It also wears a headset with LED lights and a gold chain, and it frequently carries a candy stick with it.

SCP-896 has been observed as a reliable and organized individual, capable of adhering to a routine with accuracy and dedication. However, its stubbornness can lead to difficulty when presented with new situations or ideas. SCP-896 often resists change, even when it is beneficial or necessary, which can lead to humorous situations.

SCP-896 was apprehended after being identified as operating a train at an abandoned train station in northern India. Witnesses attest that SCP-896 had full control of the train and seemed to understand its operation with remarkable fluency. Upon being detained, SCP-896 exhibited a frightened expression, particularly around its mouth.

Addendum: SCP-896 has been instrumental in providing transportation services for on-site operations. However, it has been observed that SCP-896 will only drive trains and refuses to operate any other form of transport. SCP-896 is also prone to unexpected outbursts of aggression, particularly around feeding time, and proper care should be taken when handling the subject.
