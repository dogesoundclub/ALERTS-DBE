SCP-74 has shown no unusual strength or abilities. SCP-74 displays a personality trait of being outgoing and social, which may lead them to behave in an overly friendly or attention-seeking manner.

SCP-74 has demonstrated a love for creating fashion designs, and expresses disdain towards those who do not appreciate the fashion industry. SCP-74 has shown no signs of aggressive behavior.
