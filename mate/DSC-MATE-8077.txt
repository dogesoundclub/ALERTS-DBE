Item #: SCP-8077

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8077 is held in a secure containment cell at Site-██. Due to the potential danger posed by its status as a crime boss, all personnel must exercise caution when interacting with SCP-8077.

Description: SCP-8077 is a male Siberian tiger, standing at approximately 2.25 meters tall when on all fours. Its fur is mainly orange with black stripes, and it often wears a red scarf around its neck. SCP-8077 has a frightened mouth and wears a medical mask over its face. Its eyes are replaced by VR Rainbow LED implants, and it wears a Doge hat on its head and a red cross earring on its left ear.

SCP-8077 is known to engage in organized crime activity and is believed to be the leader of a mafia group consisting of various other anomalous entities. Its personality reflects that of a traditionalist with a no-nonsense attitude, but it also possesses a playful side, often telling jokes and sharing stories passed down through its family or community.

While SCP-8077's ability to communicate with language is limited due to its anatomic differences, it has demonstrated the ability to read and write in various languages, including English, Italian, and Russian.

Addendum: Following a containment breach incident in which SCP-8077 managed to escape from its cell, it was observed attempting to flee the Site while still wearing its doge hat and medical mask. Despite its fearsome appearance, SCP-8077 appeared almost comical in its escape attempts, leading some of the security personnel to describe its behavior as "adorable." All personnel are reminded that SCP-8077 remains extremely dangerous, and caution must be exercised at all times when dealing with it.
