SCP-3024 is an anomaly in the form of a human male, identified as a reporter. While appearing completely normal to the untrained eye, his eccentric habits and fondness for inanimate objects sets him apart as a unique specimen.

He is often seen wearing a retro cap, with a jade earring visible on his right ear. His eyes are concealed by normal glasses, adding a mysterious air to his appearance. A medical mask adorns his mouth, perhaps indicating an aversion to germs or a desire for anonymity.

In addition to his unusual accessories, SCP-3024 is rarely seen without his red scarf, which he seems to hold great affection for. This characteristic extends beyond clothing, as the subject tends to display nurturing behavior toward objects in his possession. He has been observed giving his car a name, talking to plants, and even anthropomorphizing household appliances.

Interaction with SCP-3024 has been shown to elicit a sense of comfort and familiarity in those he encounters, although his peculiar ways may at times cause confusion or discomfort. As with all anomalies, caution is advised in approaching SCP-3024 and strict containment measures must be enforced to prevent any possible contamination or breach of security.
