Item #: 9555

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9555 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, as it presents a potential risk to the public due to its anomalous properties. SCP-9555 is aware of the existence of the Foundation and has agreed to cooperate with containment procedures.

SCP-9555 is to be prohibited from entering any news broadcasting stations, as its mere presence can cause a distortion in the audio and video equipment. Any recordings made of SCP-9555 must be reviewed by Level 3 personnel before being shared with the public.

Description: SCP-9555 is a human male with a unique appearance. Its face features include spotted skin and a clown mouth. Its eyes are blue clown eyes, which have demonstrated the ability to hypnotize individuals if prolonged eye contact is made. SCP-9555 often wears a short peak cap with a two-color band on its forehead, along with a green cross earring, gold chain, and candy stick.

SCP-9555 possesses the ability to alter sound frequencies within a five-meter radius, causing a static noise that can disrupt electronic devices. It appears to have developed the ability naturally and uses it to remain relevant in its profession as a news anchor. SCP-9555 is also capable of delivering deadpan jokes that are often taken as humorless statements by those who are not familiar with its sense of humor.

SCP-9555 has exhibited a cooperative attitude towards the Foundation, claiming that it recognizes the potential danger it poses to the public. It has agreed to follow all containment procedures and submit to any further testing the Foundation might require.

Addendum: SCP-9555 was discovered after multiple reports of "strange noises" during live broadcasts were linked to its presence. The Foundation was able to track its movements and contain it without incident. SCP-9555 has been cooperative since its containment, and its anomalous properties have been thoroughly documented for further study.
