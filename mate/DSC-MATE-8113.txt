Item #: 8113

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8113 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber until further notice. All attempts to communicate with SCP-8113 should be done so via a video monitor, and physical contact with the subject is prohibited due to its use of anomalous objects.

SCP-8113 is currently posing as a politician, meaning that any public appearances or speeches require Foundation agents to be present. Any interaction between SCP-8113 and non-Foundation entities must be monitored closely.

Description: SCP-8113 is a female human, standing at approximately 1.7 meters in height. The subject's most distinctive feature is the spotted pattern on their visage, which is likely an occurrence of hyperpigmentation rather than a supernatural anomaly.

SCP-8113's blue clown eyes are believed to be a result of cosmetic lenses or other anomalous alterations. An additional anomalous aspect of SCP-8113's appearance is the jade earring that is attached to their left ear.

SCP-8113 is almost always seen wearing a gold chain around their neck and an LED gas mask over their face. The gas mask is capable of producing various light patterns and altering its colors, although its specific function and purpose remain unknown.

SCP-8113's personality is characterized by extreme attention to detail and observation skills. Coupled with an almost pathological need to give the "perfect" gift to those around them, SCP-8113 can become obsessive and fixate on this task to a detriment to their own emotional stability. It is unclear whether this trait is due to an anomalous effect, but it is advised that any gifts received from SCP-8113 be carefully examined and tested for any potential effects.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8113's status as a politician and a member of the public, Foundation agents are to be present at all events where SCP-8113 is expected to appear. Any deviations from this protocol require approval from at least two Level 4 personnel.
