Item #: SCP-7289

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7289 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to clothing, sewing materials, and a sewing machine. SCP-7289's creations are to be screened for anomalous effects before being distributed to the public. Any individual affected by SCP-7289's anomalous properties are to be amnesticized, and any products already distributed must be recalled and destroyed.

Description: SCP-7289 is a human female of average height and build, with orange-dyed hair styled into a side-swept bob. SCP-7289 is a successful fashion designer and has been known to work with high-end clients. SCP-7289 is often seen wearing a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-7289 possesses an abnormal level of intuition, often able to predict events before they occur. SCP-7289 also appears to have a level of empathic ability, sensing the emotions of those around them. This ability is often exhibited when SCP-7289 creates clothing items; those who wear SCP-7289's clothing experience increased levels of confidence, luck, and charisma. These traits are often short-lived and fade soon after removing the clothing item.

SCP-7289's glasses appear to be normal, but it is currently unknown if they possess any anomalous properties. SCP-7289's notable feature is their smile, which appears to be contagious and has led to instances of increased compliance from research personnel.

SCP-7289 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and has expressed interest in designing clothing items specifically for containment personnel. Special attention must be given to materials used, as any anomalous properties present in clothing produced by SCP-7289 have the potential to affect Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-7289's anomalous abilities have been theorized to be related to reality-bending abilities. Further testing is required to confirm this hypothesis.
