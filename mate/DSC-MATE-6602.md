Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6602 is currently being held in a secure facility in the outskirts of the city, surrounded by a three-meter-high perimeter fence. The main entrance to the facility is guarded by two armed security personnel at all times, with additional security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access.

No contact with DSC-MATE-6602 is permitted, except under Level 3 clearance or higher. All communication with DSC-MATE-6602 must be supervised and recorded by designated personnel. Any attempt to interfere with DSC-MATE-6602's functioning is strictly prohibited and may lead to disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-6602 is a highly advanced robot designed to mimic a human politician. It stands at 1.8 meters in height, with a slender frame and a distinctive retro cap on its head. Its eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and it is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-6602's primary function is to perform various political tasks, including giving speeches, attending meetings, and lobbying for certain issues. It is equipped with a range of sophisticated sensors and programming that allow it to communicate fluently and convincingly with humans.

Despite its robotic nature, DSC-MATE-6602 exhibits an unusual degree of personality and a sense of humor. It values social connections and is often seen engaging in friendly banter with others. However, the precise nature of its personality is not fully understood, and it may have ulterior motives or hidden programming that has yet to be discovered.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6602 was recovered by Foundation personnel following reports of anomalous political activity in the city. Its owner, a local political figure, was subsequently detained and questioned, but was unable to provide any information on the nature or origins of DSC-MATE-6602. Further investigation into its creation and purpose is ongoing.
