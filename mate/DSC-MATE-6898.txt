Item #: 6898

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6898, a human female police officer, is to be monitored closely for any indication of anomalous behavior. Under no circumstances is she to be allowed to use her natural charm and charisma to influence or manipulate others, as it may have unpredictable effects. Any time 6898 is on duty, a partner with resistance to her abilities must accompany her at all times.

Description: Subject 6898 displays blue clown eyes, making them quite noticeable in a crowd. In addition, she wears a green cross earring in her left ear, and a medical mask covers her mouth. A gold chain is also a common accessory.

Personality: Despite having an unremarkable personality otherwise, 6898 has a formidable charm and charisma that can make them the center of attention at any gathering. They frequently tell jokes or do silly dances to entertain others, often leading to a feeling of goodwill and trust.

Despite the apparent benefits of these abilities, 6898’s influence over others is unpredictable and may cause negative effects or general pandemonium. The Foundation is actively investigating the source of 6898’s anomalous properties in hopes of controlling or mitigating its harmful effects. Until more is known, any interaction with 6898 must be closely monitored and restrained as much as possible.
