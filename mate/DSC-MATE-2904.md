Item #: 2904

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2904, known publicly as the notorious Mafia Boss, is to be kept under constant surveillance and isolation from the public. Her location is to remain undisclosed to all unauthorized personnel for their own safety. Any attempts to engage or approach the subject must be reported to the controlling authority immediately.

Description: Subject 2904 is a human female with striking features that set her apart from the rest of humanity. Her brown hair, styled in the manner of the 90s, contrasts with her piercing red clown eyes that seem to glow with an inner fire. To hide these eyes from the public, she is often seen wearing a medical mask to conceal her identity. The subject has a penchant for gold, which is evident in the gold earring on her left ear and gold chain around her neck, adding to her intimidating aura.

Personality: Despite her menacing reputation, subject 2904 is known to possess a unique trait that sets her apart from her criminal counterparts. She has an almost obsessive quality when it comes to attention to detail, which can manifest in the most unexpected ways. From alphabetized spice racks to color-coded closets, the subject has a driving need for organization and precision that extends to all aspects of her life.

Given her influence and power within the criminal underworld, her attention to detail has served her well, allowing her to stay ahead of the game and ensuring her success in every endeavor. However, do not be mistaken, for beneath her seemingly compulsive nature lies a will of iron and a ruthlessness that quickly makes itself known. 

Conclusion: Proceed with extreme caution when dealing with subject 2904. Her attention to detail, paired with her criminal empire, makes her a force to be reckoned with. Any attempts to subdue or capture the subject must be carefully planned and executed with the utmost care. Failure to do so could result in high casualties and loss of life.
