Item #: DSC-MATE-7974

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7974 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a personal computer, telephone, and other amenities deemed necessary for the comfort and well-being of the subject.

DSC-MATE-7974 is not allowed any contact with the general public, and is only permitted to leave its containment chamber for designated recreational purposes or when deemed necessary by supervising personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-7974 is a male human of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 180 pounds. He has several distinctive facial features, including numerous spots of varying size and color, a perpetually frightened-looking mouth, and blue ski goggle-like eyes.

DSC-MATE-7974's head appears to be composed of some sort of green, organic matter, which is not yet understood. Despite the obvious non-humanoid quality of the subject's head, all other body parts and features are entirely human.

DSC-MATE-7974 is a car salesman by trade, and demonstrates an above-average level of charisma and social skill when interacting with others. The subject tends to be spontaneous, and enjoys taking risks and doing things on a whim, which has led to a number of humorous situations in the past.

Addendum: Despite DSC-MATE-7974's relative lack of anomalous abilities or properties, the subject has proven to be extremely resistant to psychological manipulation or emotional influence from outside entities. This resistance extends to memetic hazards and cognitohazards, leading researchers to suspect a possible link to DSC-2000.

Further study of DSC-MATE-7974's unusual biology and resistance to influence is ongoing.
