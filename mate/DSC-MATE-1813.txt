Item #: SCP-1813

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1813 is to be contained in a standard human containment chamber at Site-██. Due to her profession, SCP-1813 is permitted access to animal subjects for her veterinary duties under supervision of at least one Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1813 appears to be a human female of average height and build with spots on her face and purple lipstick. Her eyes resemble those of a clown and are a bright blue color. SCP-1813's head resembles that of a pink rabbit, and she has a two-color band on her forehead and goggles resting on her forehead. She also wears a gold earring and a choker necklace, and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1813 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and is able to sense the emotions of those around her. This has been observed to lead to humorous situations, as SCP-1813 is able to lighten the mood or bring humor to otherwise difficult situations.

SCP-1813's anomalous properties are activated when she is touching an animal, at which point the animal's consciousness is transferred into SCP-1813's body. SCP-1813 is able to communicate with the animal telepathically and can experience the world through the animal's senses. SCP-1813 is also able to control the animal's movements and behavior while the consciousness transfer is active.

Addendum: It is requested that further research be conducted into the nature of SCP-1813's anomalous abilities, as well as the extent of her empathy and emotional sensing abilities. Additionally, all animal subjects used for SCP-1813's veterinary duties must be thoroughly examined before and after treatment to ensure no anomalous effects have been transferred.
