Item #: SCP-2800

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2800 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. Personnel interacting with SCP-2800 must wear standard safety gloves and masks, as well as monitoring devices to ensure their safety.

Description: SCP-2800 is a humanoid individual of the female sex, with orange stripes visible on their face and a red lip. They wear a bucket hat and normal glasses covering their eyes, with a pair of goggles resting on their forehead. SCP-2800 also has a green cross earring and a choker as accessories, as well as a cigarette in their possession.

SCP-2800 works as a news anchor, and their personality suggests a laid-back and easy-going demeanor. However, interviews and observations have revealed that SCP-2800 is fiercely protective of their loved ones, often leading to heated arguments with those who insult or harm them.

SCP-2800's current containment was ordered after they displayed abnormal behaviors during a live broadcast. SCP-2800's eyes briefly changed color, and all equipment in the studio malfunctioned before returning to normal. No damage was reported, but SCP-2800 was immediately brought to Site-██ for further evaluation.

Addendum: SCP-2800 has shown no signs of hostility towards Foundation staff and has cooperated with all containment procedures. Requests for interviews with SCP-2800 are pending approval by level 3 personnel.
