Item #: 3297

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3297 is to be monitored at a distance and their movements are to be tracked. No close interaction is to occur unless deemed necessary by a clearance level 3 supervisor. Subject 3297 has no noteworthy anomalous effects and poses no obvious threat to the Foundation.

Description: Subject 3297 is a human female farmer, average height and build, with several notable accessories. They have bright red lip color and wear a jade earring in each ear. Their most striking feature is their VR Jade LED eyes, through which they can zoom in and see very detailed imagery. Subject 3297 also wears a choker and an LED gas mask, which might indicate past membership in an extremist group.

Personality: Subject 3297 can be described as a highly intuitive individual who might have mild psychic abilities. They have an uncanny knack for predicting future events and reading people's emotions. This can be unsettling to some, but it also makes Subject 3297 an invaluable asset in various fields of intelligence-gathering. However, this trait of theirs also makes them highly independent and somewhat aloof, which might create difficulties when it comes to social interaction.

Addendum: Subject 3297 has not displayed any anomalous behavior so far, but close monitoring should be continued to ensure that they remain compliant with the Foundation's rules and regulations. Furthermore, further investigation into their past affiliations and any potential anomalies they might possess should be conducted.
