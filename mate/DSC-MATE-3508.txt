Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3508 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a beauty salon setup. All grooming tools, equipment, and necessary supplies must be available at all times. SCP-3508 is permitted to offer their services to Foundation personnel on a voluntary basis.

SCP-3508 is allowed to use their preferred accessories, including the horned rim glasses, Doge hat, gold earring, and cigarette. However, their emotional responses must be monitored, and exposure to sentimental media must be limited.

Description: SCP-3508 is a male tiger with a natural talent in beauty and grooming services. It possesses a unique style, with a 2-colored band on its forehead, glasses, Doge hat, and gold earring. SCP-3508 often smokes a cigarette when offered one, but shows no signs of addiction or dependency.

SCP-3508's personality is known to be highly emotional and sensitive, often moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. Its love for music and art that evokes strong emotions also supports this trait.

Despite its emotional nature, SCP-3508 is highly skilled in its profession and takes great pride in its work. It enjoys helping people feel good about themselves and their appearance. SCP-3508's exceptional talent and amicable nature make it highly popular among Foundation personnel.

Addendum 3508-A: After an incident where SCP-3508 was exposed to highly emotional media, it became highly distressed and unresponsive for several days. Personnel are reminded to limit SCP-3508's access to sentimental materials. Access to a therapist is also available if needed.
