Description: SCP-8111 is a male rabbit with VR Rainbow LED eyes, a frightened mouth, and a purple cap adorned with a headset. The rabbit has a gold earring and a silver chain around its neck. It also has a whistle and goggles on its forehead.

SCP-8111 works as a theater manager and has shown empathy and compassion towards other individuals. However, this has caused SCP-8111 to take on other people's problems as its own. SCP-8111 feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around it, which can be exhausting for the rabbit. Additionally, SCP-8111 tends to be very cautious, especially when dealing with strangers.

SCP-8111 has not shown any anomalous properties at this time, however, it is recommended that SCP-8111 be monitored closely for any changes in behavior or abilities.

Addendum 8111-1: SCP-8111 has expressed an interest in participating in D-class testing. This request has been denied due to SCP-8111's lack of any anomalous abilities and the potential risk to its well-being. SCP-8111 is to remain in containment until further notice.
