Item #: 846

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 846, a rabbit of unknown origins, is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell modified for his species. The cell must be decorated with a variety of amenities, including a small garden and multiple windows to allow for natural light. The subject is allowed to roam freely within his cell for exercise and mental stimulation, but interaction with personnel is limited to designated handlers only.

Description: Subject 846 is a male rabbit standing at a height of approximately 3 feet. He wears normal glasses on his eyes and a red beanie on his head with a two-color band on his forehead. He possesses a single jade earring on his left ear. Of particular note is his natural talent for leadership, which has led to him assuming charge of many situations he finds himself in. This includes his job as a delivery driver, where he has reportedly taken charge of several logistics and personnel issues.

Additionally, subject 846 displays a high level of intelligence and is capable of complex problem-solving. His hobbies include reading and playing chess, and he has been observed teaching fellow animal DSCs various skills such as basic math and literacy. Despite his impressive abilities, the subject displays a calm and composed demeanor, leading handlers to describe him as confident yet humble.

Due to his high level of intelligence and leadership skills, subject 846 is to be monitored closely for any signs of subversive behavior. In the event that he attempts to rally other DSCs, appropriate action will be taken to prevent any potential insurgency. However, handlers are encouraged to utilize the subject's skills for the betterment of the Foundation wherever possible.

Addendum: On multiple occasions, subject 846 has expressed a desire to work with and potentially even help humans. While interactions between DSCs and humans are not recommended, the subject's willingness to assist and limited risk level suggest the potential for further experimentation. This will be reviewed by the Ethics Committee before any action is taken.
