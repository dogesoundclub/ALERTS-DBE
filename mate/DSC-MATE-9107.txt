SCP-9107, also known as "The Tiger Doctor", is a peculiar individual that stands out among their peers. As a tiger, their physical appearance is daunting, yet the expression on their face is perpetually one of fear. Their mouth remains agape, as if they were perpetually caught in a state of dread. 

To add to their unusual appearance, SCP-9107 prefers to wear ski goggles over their eyes, granting them an otherworldly visage. Their most prominent accessory is an LED gas mask, which they utilize frequently in their line of work as a doctor. It is said that the mask contains various sensors and filters, which allow SCP-9107 to diagnose and treat their patients with unparalleled accuracy. 

Despite their frightening appearance, SCP-9107 has a reputation for being an excellent doctor. They possess an uncanny ability to fix things in unconventional ways, often using duct tape or paper clips to solve complex problems. As a result, they tend to be very hands-on, and take a practical approach to their work. 

It remains a mystery why SCP-9107 appears so frightened all the time, but it is widely speculated that they possess some form of trauma from their past. Nevertheless, when duty calls, SCP-9107 is able to put aside their fears and display bravery in the face of danger. 

It is advised to approach SCP-9107 with caution, as their behavior can be unpredictable at times. Nevertheless, if and when one requires medical attention, SCP-9107 is among the best in the business.
