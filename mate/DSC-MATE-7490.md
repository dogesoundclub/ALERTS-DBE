Item #: 7490

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7490 is currently employed as a train driver under Foundation employ. DSC-MATE-7490 should be assigned a train route that doesn't exceed eight hours, and all locomotives/drivers assigned to DSC-MATE-7490's route must be alerted to DSC-MATE-7490's anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-7490 should wear a medical mask at all times while working.

Description: DSC-MATE-7490 is a female human with unique facial features. It has orange stripes accentuating its high cheekbones, and prominent red lips. DSC-MATE-7490's eyes are considered unusual, sporting blue clown eyes. DSC-MATE-7490's forehead features two color bands that wrap wide above its eyebrows. DSC-MATE-7490 has brown hair, which has been described as "90s", meaning straight and tamed. DSC-MATE-7490 regularly wears a medical mask, concealing its mouth from view. 

DSC-MATE-7490's anomalous properties primarily manifest through its natural charisma and charm. They can make them the life of the party, able to make people laugh with ease. It can be comedic at times, telling jokes or doing silly dances to make others laugh, but Foundation personnel must remain vigilant, as the magnitude of DSC-MATE-7490's charm could result in security breaches or anomalies in and of itself.

Addendum: Upon initial containment, DSC-MATE-7490 had on its person a noticeable amount of class-B amnestics, and an expired employee pass from a train station located near Site-██. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-7490 was working at a local diner before its discovery, frequently using its charm to pocket extra tips. All experimental testing is to be approved before execution, as DSC-MATE-7490's potential for mind-altering properties poses an inherent risk to those around it.
