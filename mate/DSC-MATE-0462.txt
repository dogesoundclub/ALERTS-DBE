Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 462 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls and a secure locking mechanism. Access is limited to Level 2 personnel or higher with direct approval from Site Director. Item 462 is to be provided with a daily diet of fruits, vegetables, and grains. In the event of a containment breach, staff should be aware that Item 462 has shown a propensity for hiding in tight spaces and utilizing its acrobatic ability to evade capture.

Description: Item 462 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, measuring 51 cm in height and weighing 13.6 kg. A distinguishing feature of Item 462 is its red clown eyes, which are believed to be a pigment mutation. Its mouth is often in a frightened expression, which has been noted to be a result of its relocation to Foundation custody.

Item 462's head is adorned by a mohawk, and it has a pair of goggles resting on its forehead. It is often seen wearing a red scarf and a specialized LED gas mask, which provides it with the necessary oxygen concentration for its species. Its unique choice of accessories has been attributed to its humorous personality, which often manifests in witty banter and pranks.

Personality: Item 462 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. It often resorts to telling funny stories, doing silly impersonations, or performing acrobatic stunts to lighten the mood. Its personality has been noted to be a defense mechanism, meant to distract from the uncomfortable subject of its confinement.

However, Item 462's sense of humor can also be a liability, as it may not take certain situations seriously. Its tendency to hide in tight spaces and its acrobatic ability have resulted in incidents of mischief, leading to difficulty in its containment. Personnel are reminded to exercise caution when interacting with Item 462 and to prioritize its safe containment above its comedic tendencies.

Addendum: Item 462 has shown signs of cooperation and intelligence and has expressed a desire to participate in scientific studies. A request has been made to the Ethics Committee for consideration of Item 462's participation in cognitive and behavioral research.
