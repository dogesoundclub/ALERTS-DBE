Item #: 1492

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1492 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with furnishings suitable for a rabbit species. The chamber is to be secured with a high-voltage and high-frequency containment shield, capable of generating an electromagnetic field that confounds Item 1492's ability to control its environment with its natural leadership talents. However, Item 1492 is deemed essential for the security of the facility and is authorized to work as an on-site security guard. It is to be accompanied by two armed human guards at all times.

Description: Item 1492 is a male rabbit that stands 1.12 meters tall on its hind legs. It weighs approximately 17 kilograms and can jump up to 3 meters high. Its fur is dark gray in color with some white paws and tail-tip. Item 1492 has a pair of goggles that can rotate like a binocular on its forehead, which can grant it the ability to see clearly even in the dark. It also carries a whistle which it uses to alert nearby personnel of potential security threats.

Personality: Item 1492 possesses innate leadership skills that make it a natural at taking charge of situations, whether in its personal life, work, or social group. It is highly observant, intuitive, and can quickly assess threats, making it an asset to the facility's security team. Item 1492 is friendly and sociable, but can be assertive when necessary. Despite its appearance, Item 1492 displays a keen intelligence wit that can even throw off some of its more confounding colleagues. 

Additional Notes: Item 1492 is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation's security team, and its natural leadership traits should be encouraged, rewarded, and carefully monitored at all times. In a power outage or electrical failure, Item 1492 must be relocated to a non-electric containment chamber and considered a high priority for the renewal of secure containment. In the event of emergency security protocol, Item 1492 must not be considered hostile and all available efforts must be made to remove it from harm's way.
