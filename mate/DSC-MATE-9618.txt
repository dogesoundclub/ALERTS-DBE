SCP-9618 can be scheduled for interviews and interactions with Foundation personnel upon request, preferably with prior written permission from the Lead Researcher. It is also encouraged for SCP-9618 to meet with other animal specimens to observe and potentially learn from them. 

Description: SCP-9618 is a male Bengal tiger, measuring 3.5 meters in length and weighing approximately 700 kilograms. SCP-9618 wears a doge hat on his head and a red cross earring on his left ear. He also has a silver chain around his neck. The materialization of these accessories is currently unknown. Despite SCP-9618â€™s unexpected appearance, he has proven to be friendly and cooperative during interactions. 

The veterinarian persona of SCP-9618 manifests in his interest in the health and well-being of his fellow animal specimens, as well as humans who are in need of medical attention. SCP-9618 also shows a great respect for tradition and may display beliefs and customs that have been passed down through his family or community. He can at times display a no-nonsense attitude and prefers to stick to established routines. However, he has a playful side and has been known to tell jokes and stories that have been passed down to him. 

Addendum: SCP-9618 has shown interest in learning more about human society and culture. Request for experiments involving SCP-9618 being introduced to human society have been denied. Interaction with humans is to be limited to research personnel and security forces only.
