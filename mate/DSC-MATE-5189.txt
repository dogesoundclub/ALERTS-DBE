Item #: 5189

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5189 is to be allowed to live a normal life with access to standard technology. All outside communication is to be monitored for any suspicious activity or signs of anomalous abilities.

Description: SCP-5189 is a humanoid with a unique appearance. The subject has a mouth spot located on the lower right side of their face, which is often mistaken for a tattoo. The subject wears a pair of "nerd glasses," sporting a unique design that is not found in any commercial markets. SCP-5189 is observed to have a mohawk-style haircut and has a gold earring on their right ear. Additionally, SCP-5189 often wears a silver chain necklace and carries a candy stick in their pocket.

SCP-5189 is a programmer by profession and has shown no signs of psychological deviations. The subject exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, reflecting their ability to work efficiently and complete all tasks on time. Despite this, SCP-5189 does not shy away from humor and can often be found in the middle of a party, showing off their dance moves or encouraging others to sing along to their favorite songs.

SCP-5189's anomalous ability is not clear. There have been no observed instances where SCP-5189's actions could be considered paranormal. However, continuous monitoring for any signs of anomalous activity is still underway.

Addendum: Following a routine psychological evaluation, SCP-5189 requested permission to bring in their pet rock to their workplace. The request was granted, and the following day, a small rock painted with a smiley face was found on SCP-5189's desk. Observed effects of this object are not yet known.
