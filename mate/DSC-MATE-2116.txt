Item #: SCP-2116

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2116 is to be employed as a traffic officer and is to be provided with standard issue equipment for that position. 2116's duties will remain within confined areas of Site-[REDACTED] to prevent accidental exposure to members of the public.

Description: SCP-2116 appears to be a male monkey of indeterminate species. The subject measures approximately 0.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 10 kilograms. The subject is distinguishable by its blue bandana wrapped around its head which is believed to be self-affixed.

SCP-2116 largely appears to have a laid-back and easy-going personality, often taking long breaks in between patrols. However, when approached by individuals who SCP-2116 believes may be a threat to those around them, or to those he is loyal to, SCP-2116 has been known to exhibit fiercely protective behavior.

Further research has indicated that SCP-2116's behavior regarding its loyalty may extend beyond its closest personal bonds, as it has demonstrated similar behavior in situations where it perceives danger to the public at large, even at the cost of putting itself in danger.

SCP-2116 is known to smoke cigarettes though the frequency of this activity is unknown.

Addendum: In light of SCP-2116's protective behavior, and its status as a loyal and effective agent, further exploration into the application of similar mindsets to other agents of the Foundation may prove worthwhile. Research on the potential uses of SCP-2116's behavior is ongoing.
