Item #: 8369

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: Subject #8369 is to be contained within Site-███'s Living Quarters, in a habitat resembling a modern apartment. All standard amenities must be provided, along with a standard firefighting uniform and equipment. A human handler must be assigned to the subject at all times, ensuring all needs are met with strict adherence to the established schedule.

Additionally, a strict routine of tailored exercises must be conducted three times a day mimicking natural hunting, stalking and climbing behaviors, as well as specialized medical care to compensate for the physiological differences between human and tiger bodies. The subject is not to be exposed to media or any form of stimulation that may incite agitation or aggressive behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-8369 is a male Bengal tiger in appearance possessing a green fur, measuring 2.4 meters long and weighing 216 kilograms. The subject has a red victory band around his forehead and a red cross earring on his right ear. He wears a standard medical mask for reasons related to his occupation as a firefighter.

DSC 8369 is an intelligent being with an analytical and logical personality, prone to exhibiting a peculiar sense of humor. He is particularly fond of making dry observations and teasing those around him, often to the extent of testing their emotional resilience. Despite this, he is deeply empathetic and has a strong sense of loyalty to those who care for him. 

DSC 8369 was first discovered by the Foundation in the ██████████ Fire Department, after reports of a "tiger mascot" being frequently seen on rescue missions. The subject is believed to have gained the ability to speak through anomalies present in the political environment that aroused consciousness in animals. The Foundation has conducted in-depth testing and experimentation on the subject, which confirms the anomalous nature of his experience.

DSC 8369 has a unique talent of locating survivors and predicting the source of a fire. Further study is required to fully understand the capabilities of this remarkable being. 

Addendum: During containment, the subject has served as an invaluable asset to the Foundation in the response to fire-related anomalies around the world, allowing for quicker and more efficient responses. The care of DSC-MATE-8369 is essential for maintaining the Foundation's reputation and his well-being. Any deviation from this protocol may result in irreparable damage to the Foundation's goals.
