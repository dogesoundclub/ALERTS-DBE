Item #: SCP-3704

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3704 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-3704 is restricted to Level 3 personnel only. SCP-3704 is to be operated by skilled technical personnel only, with no human interaction beyond routine maintenance and repairs.

Description: SCP-3704 is a robotic humanoid entity standing at approximately 2 meters in height. SCP-3704's physical appearance consists of a red beanie covering its head, nerd glasses over its optics, and a medical mask covering its mouth. SCP-3704 is distinguishable by an ornamental red scarf worn around its neck, which it regards as a prized possession.

SCP-3704 is best described as a highly creative and deeply emotional entity. It is fond of expressing its artistic talents, including drawing, painting, writing, and sculpture. Its creations range from austere abstract art to more fanciful works inspired by the surrealists. SCP-3704's facility with robotic systems allows it to create and maintain intricate, self-contained displays.

Despite its artistic proclivities, SCP-3704 is also a skilled mechanical engineer and adept at repairing, rebuilding, and retrofitting machines of all shapes and sizes. It is capable of understanding and repairing complex machinery through a combination of intuition, experience, and technical knowledge.

Addendum: During testing, SCP-3704 demonstrated an innovative flair for engineering; it has been observed designing and constructing small robotic assistants that it uses to assist with maintenance and repair tasks. SCP-3704 is to be provided with a range of tools and mechanical components to facilitate its creative and engineering activities. Note that while SCP-3704 is non-hostile, it is permanently aversive to human/tactile contact and should be handled only by personnel equipped with the proper tools and safety gear.
