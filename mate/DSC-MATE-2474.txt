Item #: SCP-2474

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2474 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. To avoid potential breaches, all personnel who are assigned to SCP-2474's containment area must undergo thorough background checks and a psychological evaluation. SCP-2474 is to be fed a carnivorous diet once daily and secured in a double-locked enclosure at all times.

Description: SCP-2474 appears to be a humanoid tiger with green hair in a purple cap. It has blue clown eyes and one gold earring on each ear. SCP-2474 is approximately 1.88 meters tall and weighs approximately 237 kilograms. SCP-2474 communicates in fluent English and exhibits knowledge of advanced mathematics and economics.

SCP-2474 claims to be a banker who was transformed into a tiger after a botched deal with a supernatural entity. SCP-2474's personality is described as impulsive and prone to acting on emotions rather than logic. This has resulted in SCP-2474 making spontaneous decisions that have surprised and amused those around it.

SCP-2474 wears a gold chain around its neck and a normal gas mask as a precaution against accidental inhalation of foreign substances. SCP-2474's physical strength is significantly greater than that of an ordinary human. It has demonstrated the ability to leap long distances and to break through walls with minimal effort.

SCP-2474's anomalous properties extend to its diet. SCP-2474 has exhibited the ability to consume various types of meat that would otherwise be poisonous to humans. SCP-2474's digestive system appears to be capable of neutralizing the toxins found in certain types of meat, allowing SCP-2474 to survive on a strictly carnivorous diet.

Addendum: During a routine medical examination, it was discovered that SCP-2474's DNA is significantly different from that of a natural tiger. Further testing is required to determine the extent of these differences and their potential implications.
