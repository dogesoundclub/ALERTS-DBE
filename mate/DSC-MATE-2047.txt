Item #: SCP-2047

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2047 is currently contained within Site-███'s personnel quarters. Due to its mundane appearance, SCP-2047 should not be allowed to leave the containment area unsupervised, as it may pose a potential security risk. Access to SCP-2047 is restricted to personnel holding Level 2 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-2047 is a male human, standing at 183 cm tall and weighing approximately 80kg. SCP-2047's facial feature #1 consists of orange stripes, which appear to be natural and not due to any form of pigmentation or makeup. SCP-2047 is often observed wearing a purple cap with a headset, along with red victory band on its forehead and nerd glasses on its eyes.

SCP-2047 displays an abnormal personality trait in the form of constant brainstorming ideas. It seemingly enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas, regardless of how practical or appropriate they may be in the given situation. This behavior often leads to humorous or outlandish suggestions, which can confuse or shock those around it. Although SCP-2047's behavior is not considered harmful in nature, it can be disruptive and distracting to others.

During questioning, SCP-2047 has claimed to be a theater manager by profession and expressed a keen interest in promoting and presenting shows. However, SCP-2047's background and identity remain unclear, as well as any potential anomalous properties it may possess.

Addendum-2047-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-2047's brainstorming behavior led to a potential security breach when it suggested that the Site security system could be easily bypassed by infiltrators disguising themselves as large circus animals. This idea was quickly dismissed, but it highlighted SCP-2047's potential to suggest dangerous or compromising solutions. As a result, it has been closely monitored and given limited access to sensitive information.
