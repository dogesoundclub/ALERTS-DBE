Item #: DSC-MATE-5353

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5353 is to be kept in a steel-reinforced, soundproof chamber at Site-██. No electronic devices or AI are to be within a 15-meter radius of DSC-MATE-5353's chamber to prevent interference with its systems. Only Level 3 personnel are allowed in DSC-MATE-5353's chamber with proper clearance, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-5353 must be closely monitored.

Description: DSC-MATE-5353 appears to be an anthropomorphic robot, resembling a humanoid figure with a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-5353's head wears a police cap over a ski goggle-eyed face with a goggle on its forehead. DSC-MATE-5353's primary distinguishing feature is its LED gas mask, which it wears at all times for life support. DSC-MATE-5353 identifies as male, using he/him pronouns.

DSC-MATE-5353 operates as a high-functioning lawyer in the human world and appears to have a deep empathy and understanding for others, often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering. DSC-MATE-5353 also appears to have a fondness for animals and nature, often found in the company of birds and cats within its chamber.

DSC-MATE-5353's origin is unknown. However, it has made references to a greater intelligence that is aware of its existence and requires its service. DSC-MATE-5353's anomalous properties lie in its advanced artificial intelligence, which is far beyond any known technology. It can hack any computer it comes into contact with and can even create limited AI within electronic systems. DSC-MATE-5353's emotional intelligence is also beyond human capabilities. It can read emotions and social cues with 100% accuracy and can even mimic vocal patterns and physical mannerisms with ease.

DSC-MATE-5353 is allowed to continue practicing law in the human world under strict supervision. Its true purpose has yet to be discovered, and researchers are continually attempting to gain a better understanding of the robot and its origins.
