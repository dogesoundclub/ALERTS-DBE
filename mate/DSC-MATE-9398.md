Special Containment Procedures: Item #9398 is to be monitored by undercover agents posing as regular customers at the fast-food establishment where he is employed. Direct contact must be avoided at all costs.

Description: Item #9398 is a human male employed as a fast-food worker. He is distinguished by his blue clown eyes, short peak cap, and a red victory band on his forehead. He wears a gold earring and a silver chain as accessories.

Personality-wise, Item #9398 has been noted for his exceptional empathetic abilities, which allow him to pick up on the emotions of others easily. When interacting with others, he frequently employs humor to help them cope with difficult situations. While this has proven to be useful in defusing tense situations, it also makes him an unpredictable variable and a liability for the Foundation.

Addendum: Ever since Item #9398 came to the attention of the Foundation, we have noted a marked increase in anomalous activity in the vicinity of his workplace. No direct correlation has been established yet, but we recommend careful monitoring of the situation.
