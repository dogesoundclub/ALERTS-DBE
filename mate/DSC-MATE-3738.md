Item #: 3738

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3738 is to be allowed to continue its employment as a firefighter, as long as it does not present a threat to the general public. The Foundation is to monitor subject 3738's actions and whereabouts, and retrieve subject 3738 if any anomalous activity is detected.

Description: Subject 3738 is a human female with distinct facial features, including purple lips and VR rainbow LED eyes. Its hair is 90s style brown, and it wears a gold earring, choker, and LED gas mask. 

Subject 3738 has a tendency towards introspection, which results in it becoming lost in thought and unaware of its surroundings. This has led to situations where subject 3738 has accidentally walked into objects or tripped over things. However, subject 3738 is highly skilled in firefighting and has proven invaluable in many dangerous situations.

Subjects 3738's anomalous traits have been determined to be non-threatening to the general public, and therefore, it has not been classified as a sentient DSC. However, monitoring of the subject's activities shall continue.

Addendum: During recent testing, it was discovered that subject 3738's LED gas mask is capable of emitting a low-frequency sound wave that induces a deep meditative state in those within a ten-meter radius. Further testing is required to determine the extent of this ability.
