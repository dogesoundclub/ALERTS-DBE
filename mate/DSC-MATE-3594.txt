Item #: SCP-3594

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3594 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-3594 is to be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards. 

SCP-3594 is allowed to keep a small collection of books and personal items. However, any communication or contact with the outside world is strictly forbidden. 

Description: SCP-3594 is a female human of Caucasian descent, measuring approximately 5'7" in height and weighing approximately 120 pounds. SCP-3594 wears a black suit with a purple lip, an ushanka hat, goggles on her forehead, and an earring of a red cross on her left ear.

SCP-3594 has shown an extremely high degree of intelligence and organization skills, which have been noted to be useful in its position as a Mafia boss. SCP-3594 has developed an almost obsessive compulsive focus on planning, resulting in a need to control all aspects of their environment.

SCP-3594's spontaneous side has been known to emerge in certain social situations, surprising those around them with unexpected bursts of humor or creativity. However, these occurrences are often accompanied by an underlying sense of danger, and as such, SCP-3594 is to be treated with extreme caution at all times.

Addendum: Due to SCP-3594's skills, it has been proposed that SCP-3594 could be useful in covert operations for the Foundation if proper safety measures and precautions are taken. Discussions regarding the feasibility of these operations are still ongoing.
