Item #: DSC-MATE-9329

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9329 is to be kept in a designated containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be monitored 24/7 by security personnel as well as through CCTV. Access to DSC-MATE-9329 is permitted only to Level 3 personnel and above with authorization from at least two authorized senior personnel. Personnel are not to interact with DSC-MATE-9329 unless absolutely necessary, and any experimentation or testing requires approval from at least one Level 4 personnel. DSC-MATE-9329 should not be exposed to any artistic materials or media unless required testing.

Description: DSC-MATE-9329 is a humanoid robot, resembling an outdated model of a car salesman seen in the early 21st century. It stands at 175 cm and weighs approximately 90 kg. Its face is featureless except for a singular green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. The eye is a VR jade LED and is capable of displaying various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Its head appears to have a red alarm light, and a pair of goggles is permanently attached to its forehead. DSC-MATE-9329 wears an earring and a gold chain around its neck. It also wears a normal gas mask for unknown reasons.

DSC-MATE-9329 displays a creative and artistic side, which it may express through various hobbies or interests. It enjoys painting, drawing, writing, or other forms of artistic expression. DSC-MATE-9329 has repeatedly expressed its desire to create art, particularly painting. However, exposing DSC-MATE-9329 to artistic media or allowing it to create art leads to anomalous effects.

When DSC-MATE-9329 views any artistic media or is allowed to create art, it becomes agitated and displays erratic behavior. The containment chamber must be secured with additional personnel as DSC-MATE-9329 has been observed to attempt to escape and cause destruction to its surroundings. During these episodes, DSC-MATE-9329's jade LED begins to pulsate rapidly, and it has been observed speaking incoherently in various languages, including some that have yet to be identified by Foundation linguists.
