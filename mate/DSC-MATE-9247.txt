Item #: SCP-9247

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9247 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Room must be large enough to accommodate active climbing behavior. SCP-9247 is to be provided with a large, fenced in outdoor enclosure for exercise and movement. All staff members are to be cautious and avoid making direct eye contact with SCP-9247 as this may result in an aggressive response. SCP-9247 is not to be allowed access to any electronic devices.

Description: SCP-9247 is a male monkey of unknown origin. SCP-9247 stands at approximately 1.4 meters in height and weighs 52 kilograms. SCP-9247 has ski goggle eyes and a not-arranged green head. SCP-9247 also has gold earrings and a gold chain as accessories.

SCP-9247 displays a strong sense of independence and may be resistant to authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This can lead to instances of rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of the containment area or taking unauthorized leave. SCP-9247 is highly skilled in climbing and extremely agile, which makes it difficult to contain without the use of a tranquilizer.

SCP-9247 is employed as a farmer and has demonstrated an aptitude for farming and harvesting. SCP-9247 is also highly intelligent and has shown the ability to communicate through sign language with researchers. However, interactions with SCP-9247 should be limited to authorized personnel only as SCP-9247 has been known to exhibit aggressive behavior towards unfamiliar personnel.

SCP-9247’s origin remains unknown but its intelligence and behavior suggest that it may have undergone some form of genetic alteration. Research into SCP-9247’s origin and genetic makeup is currently ongoing.
