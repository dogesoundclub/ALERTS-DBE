Item #: 4916

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4916 is to be kept under constant observation in a standard containment chamber. All personnel entering the containment chamber must be thoroughly vetted and cleared. Direct communication with SCP-4916 is not allowed unless strictly necessary, as it has been noted to show a level of intelligence and unpredictability that affects those that engage with it.

Description: SCP-4916 is a rabbit of remarkable intelligence and hair styling abilities. Despite its fringed, fluffy exterior, SCP-4916 displays undeniable leadership qualities and exceptional multitasking abilities. SCP-4916 is often seen wearing a police cap and sporting a pair of horned rim glasses, along with a jade earring, which appears to be somewhat sentient, and follows any commands given by SCP-4916.

SCP-4916 is often witnessed carrying a cigarette and displays an unyielding sense of duty and commitment to its profession. It is said to have a keen sense of customer satisfaction and often takes on more work than it can handle, leading to comical situations such as carrying too many things at once.

Personality: SCP-4916 is determined and unrelenting in its quest to provide the best hair-styling services possible. Its playful nature and quick-witted humor are famed among those that have interacted with it. However, it has been noted that SCP-4916 lacks any form of emotional connection to those around it, and its perceived humor or kindness is regarded as a coping mechanism, a cover for its severe isolation.

SCP-4916 displays several abilities that are yet to be fully understood, including a seemingly innate ability to shape-shift into any animal form it desires. Additionally, it has been known to display supernatural abilities such as the ability to transport itself from one place to another at a moment's notice. 

Note from Dr. ██████: It is imperative that we continue to study SCP-4916's abilities, particularly its shapeshifting and teleportation skills. Its intelligence and unpredictability mean that we must proceed with caution and strict containment procedures. Any breach of protocol could have dire consequences for both SCP-4916 and our personnel.
