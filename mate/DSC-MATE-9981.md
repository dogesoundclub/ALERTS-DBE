Subject 9981 is a curious specimen, identified as a human male working as a reporter. He could be easily recognized by his distinguishing facial feature, a bright smile. But be warned, his eyes are something else entirely. Through technological advancements, his eyes now emit a vibrant VR Rainbow LED that seems to mesmerize those who dare to make direct eye contact. 

His head is adorned with green hair adorned with a purple cap, and a pair of goggles are perched upon his forehead - a clear indicator of his curious nature. In each ear dangles a set of flashy gold earrings, perhaps another representation of his insatiable thirst for the eccentric.

And let us not forget about the bright red scarf draped around his neck, adding a pop of color to his already chaotic appearance. 

Personality-wise, he is a natural-born brainstormer with a passion for thinking outside of the box. He takes pleasure in crafting innovative ideas and compelling stories, sometimes even suggesting ludicrous solutions to problems just to gauge the reactions of those around him. 

Keep a watchful eye on this one - it's never quite clear what he'll come up with next.
