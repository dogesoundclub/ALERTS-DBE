Item #: 98

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 98 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The room should be furnished with a table, chairs, and writing instruments to enable communication with the subject. It is not allowed to provide any type of cigarettes to the subject under any circumstances. A monitoring system must be installed to ensure constant surveillance of the subject. Any unauthorized person attempting to make contact with the subject must be immediately evacuated.

Description: Subject 98 is a monkey species male that presents a unique set of characteristics. While on the surface, the subject's appearance may seem odd, the most remarkable features are his ski goggles, purple cap with a headset, and gold earring. These accessories have been observed to work as communicative devices, and the subject has been seen using them to interact with his handler.

However, the most extraordinary aspect of subject 98's personality is his wild, impulsive nature. He has demonstrated a complete disregard for rules and regulations, often acting on a whim regardless of the consequences. This trait might be amusing in social settings but poses a severe risk to the Foundation's security protocols.

Personality: Subject 98 is a thrill-seeker, constantly seeking adventure that can lead to humorous or dangerous situations. He has been seen jumping off cliffs into waterways or instigating other kinds of risky behavior. However, these erratic actions may come at a severe cost, as they can jeopardize the safety and well-being of himself and anyone else involved.

Additionally, the subject is commonly observed with a cigarette, a habit strictly prohibited inside the Foundation facilities. This behavior indicates that subject 98 might have developed an addiction to nicotine, a fact that needs to be taken into consideration during his containment.

Addendum: The Foundation became aware of subject 98's peculiar demeanor when reports surfaced about a talking monkey in a courtroom engaging in legal proceedings alongside a lawyer. After a thorough investigation, the Foundation intercepted and contained the anomalous creature.

Interrogation sessions have revealed that subject 98 is capable of speech, but his vocal chords and enunciation are limited, making his communication difficult to understand. Even so, it is clear that the subject's legal expertise is derived from his exposure to humans during his previous lawyer job. Nevertheless, the subject's judgment and behavior may not be trusted in any way, making him an unpredictable and volatile element within the Foundation's custody.
