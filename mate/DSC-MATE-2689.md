Item #: DSC-MATE-2689

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2689 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-███. Due to their rebellious behavior and resistance to authority, interactions with DSC-MATE-2689 must be strictly monitored and controlled. They are to be provided with basic amenities and any necessary medical assistance, but are not to be granted any special privileges or freedom beyond what is deemed necessary for maintaining their physical and mental health.

Description: DSC-MATE-2689 is a human female appearing to be in their early twenties, identified as a fast food worker. They display an unusual appearance with orange stripes on their face and a prominent red lip, as well as normal glasses that do not appear to enhance or correct their vision. DSC-MATE-2689's head resembles that of a schoolgirl from the early 2000s, with green cross earrings and a choker as additional accessories. They also wear a normal gas mask, which they claim is necessary for personal comfort and hygiene.

DSC-MATE-2689 has a strong sense of independence and is resistant to authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This often leads to rebellious behavior, such as breaking established protocols or disregarding orders from those in charge. They have shown a propensity for sneaking out of their containment cell early or taking unscheduled days off without permission.

DSC-MATE-2689 has not displayed any anomalous abilities or effects on their own, but their behavior and appearance are notable enough to warrant containment and study. Further investigation is necessary to determine any additional anomalous properties or potential hazards.
