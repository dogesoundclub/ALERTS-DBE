SCP-2243, also known by their train conductor alias, "Tiger," is a male tiger of average height and build. Despite their imposing appearance, SCP-2243 displays a frightened mouth, expressing vulnerability and unease. SCP-2243 is often seen wearing a bucket hat atop their tiger head, with a red cross earring adorning each of their ears.

As a train driver, SCP-2243 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, evident in their ability to operate trains with precision and care. However, this sense of duty sometimes leads them to take on more than they can handle, often resulting in hilarious mishaps. Whether they are attempting to fit all of their tasks into a single day or struggling to carry too many items, SCP-2243's antics never cease to entertain.

SCP-2243's behavior is likely a result of their feline instinct to maintain order and control over their environment. Despite their humorous mishaps, SCP-2243 remains a reliable and efficient train conductor, displaying a heightened sense of awareness and responsibility for the safety of the passengers in their care.

Despite their successful career as a train conductor, little information is known about SCP-2243's origins and how they came to be a tiger. Further research is needed to uncover any potential anomalous properties that may be linked to SCP-2243's species and appearance.
