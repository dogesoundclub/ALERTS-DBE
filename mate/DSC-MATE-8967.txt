SCP-8967, also known as "The Banker", is a male monkey of unknown origin. He is employed as a banker and can be found wearing a purple cap adorned with green hair, and a red scarf around his neck. SCP-8967 has a pair of normal glasses and a frightened mouth, which may give the impression of timidity, but this could not be farther from the truth.

SCP-8967 is surprisingly efficient and organized, with a habit of taking charge in situations that call for it. He carries a whistle as an accessory and can be heard using it to grab people's attention when need be. SCP-8967 has a unique forehead feature consisting of a two-color band, which hasn't been seen before in any primate species. 

SCP-8967's personality tends to be rather controlling, leading him to delegate tasks to others to ensure they are completed to his standards. Though this behavior can sometimes lead to humorous situations in group projects or events, SCP-8967 always makes sure everything goes according to plan. When interacting with others, SCP-8967 can seem detached and reserved, but this is due to his laser-focused mindset.

As with all SCPs, exercising caution when interacting with SCP-8967 is strongly advised.
