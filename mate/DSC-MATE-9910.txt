Item #: SCP-9910

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9910 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. She is allowed to work as a real estate agent in the nearby city, but must be monitored at all times to ensure she does not display any anomalous behavior.

Description: SCP-9910 is a human female, approximately 28 years old. She stands at 5’7” and weighs approximately 125 lbs. SCP-9910 has distinct physical features, including orange stripes on her face and a green head with edge curl. She wears a pair of goggles on her forehead and a jade earring in each ear. She is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck.

SCP-9910’s main anomalous property is her highly efficient and organized personality. She has a tendency to take charge of group projects and events, delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. While this may come across as controlling or bossy to some, SCP-9910’s abilities have proven useful in a variety of situations.

SCP-9910’s real estate career has shown no signs of being affected by her anomalous properties. In fact, she has become one of the top-performing agents in the city, with a reputation for being detail-oriented and professional.

Addendum: SCP-9910’s anomalous properties have proven useful in several containment breaches, where she has displayed exceptional leadership skills and helped to keep the situation under control. She has been recognized and commended by her superiors for her contributions. However, caution should still be exercised around SCP-9910, as her abilities could potentially be used for nefarious purposes.
