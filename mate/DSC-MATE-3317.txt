Identification number 3317, otherwise known as "The Real Estate Agent," is a curious specimen of the human species. Her most striking feature is her infectious smile, which has been known to draw people in like a moth to a flame.

But don't be fooled by her friendly demeanor - there's something uncanny about this agent. Perhaps it's the red cross earring dangling from her ear, or the medical mask she wears over her mouth at all times. And let's not forget that goggle she keeps perched on her forehead, as if ready to spring into action at a moment's notice.

There's no denying that "The Real Estate Agent" enjoys the limelight; she's a social butterfly who loves to tell jokes and stories that have everyone in stitches. But there's something almost too perfect about her, as if she's been engineered to be the life of the party.

Beware her choker, a shiny black band that glimmers like a snake's scales. No one is quite sure what its purpose is, but it seems to hold some sort of power over those who catch a glimpse of it.

Approach "The Real Estate Agent" with caution. Though she may seem like just another friendly face, there's something otherworldly lurking beneath the surface. And it's certainly not something you want to get involved with unless you're prepared for the consequences.
