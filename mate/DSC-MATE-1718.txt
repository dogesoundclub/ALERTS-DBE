Item #: SCP-1718

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1718 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, with appropriate food and medical care. As a precaution, all staff and researchers interacting with SCP-1718 must wear Level 2 biohazard protection suits due to the risk of disease transmission. Any reports of abnormal behavior or health concerns must be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1718 is a male monkey, identified as a "banker" based on the information provided. It appears to possess advanced cognitive abilities, allowing it to effectively communicate in human languages and perform complex banking tasks. SCP-1718 has a laid-back demeanor, but can become fiercely protective of loved ones, leading to situations of heightened aggression towards perceived threats.

SCP-1718 is commonly seen wearing a red beanie on its head, with a jade earring attached to one of its ears. It is frequently observed smoking cigarettes, indicating a likely history of substance abuse. SCP-1718's normal glasses serve as its primary visual aid.

Although SCP-1718's behavior is generally cooperative, it has been known to display belligerent tendencies towards human subjects who it perceives as a threat to itself or its loved ones. There are also concerns that SCP-1718 may carry infectious diseases, leading to strict biohazard protocols for those interacting with it.

Addendum: SCP-1718 was acquired by the Foundation due to its unusual abilities and behavior. Research is ongoing to determine the full extent of its cognitive capabilities and potential applications within Foundation operations. Any attempts by SCP-1718 to escape or harm personnel must be immediately contained and reported to Site Security.
