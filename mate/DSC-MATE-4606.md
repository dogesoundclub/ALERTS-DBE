Item #: 4606

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4606 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a functional train simulator set up to mimic DSC-MATE-4606's train driving duties. DSC-MATE-4606 is allowed access to a designated smoking area within the containment chamber to allow for its cigarette use. Any communication with DSC-MATE-4606 must be conducted through a computer terminal or headset, due to the potential for moisture damage to electronic equipment caused by DSC-MATE-4606's Rabbit physiology.

Description: DSC-MATE-4606 is a Rabbit species humanoid wearing a train driver's uniform, complete with embroidered name tag marking it as "Driver Grayson." DSC-MATE-4606's eyes are obscured by horned-rimmed glasses, and it wears a headset with an LED light attached. The forehead of DSC-MATE-4606 features a two-toned colored band, indicative of its train driver position. Additionally, DSC-MATE-4606 is always seen with a cigarette in hand.

DSC-MATE-4606 exhibits deep empathy and understanding towards others, including human subjects it has interacted with. DSC-MATE-4606 may display emotional outbursts when witnessing the pain or suffering of others, often leading to tears. DSC-MATE-4606 also displays interest and affection towards animal and nature subjects, further highlighting its empathetic nature.

Addendum 4606-A: Initial containment of DSC-MATE-4606 resulted in several attempts to disrupt containment by DSC-MATE-4606 exhibiting rabbit-like agility and vocalizations. However, through the use of a simulated train driving scenario and routine interaction with Foundation personnel, DSC-MATE-4606 has since cooperated with containment operations. Further research is ongoing to determine any anomalous properties or effects of DSC-MATE-4606's empathy and emotional displays.
