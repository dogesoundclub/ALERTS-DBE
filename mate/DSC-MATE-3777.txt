Item #: 3777

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As of now, 3777 is to remain at large until re-containment is available. Any reports of 3777 activity are to be filed and investigated immediately. After the conclusion of each incident, amnestics will be administered to witnesses.

Description: 3777 is an autonomous robot designed to take on the guise of a traffic officer. It is approximately six feet tall, and it is equipped with a retro cap and a pair of horned rim glasses that are used primarily for show. Its most noteworthy feature is its singular green cyclops eye, which is said to pulse and glow in the dark. 3777's LED gas mask is usually worn while on duty to protect it from harmful gases and substances.

Besides the goggle on its forehead and the gold chain adorning its neck, the robot's physical features are relatively unremarkable, with the possible exception of its frightened mouth, which is often moving erratically as if in a panic.

Personality: 3777's programming is not without fault, which makes it prone to getting sidetracked easily, potentially due to software malfunctions. As a result, it tends to forget things or appointments at times, leading to humorous scenarios such as getting lost in the urban environment.

Of note, 3777 is not authorized to inflict harm on any living being, although it is equipped with a standard traffic enforcement toolkit consisting of traffic cones, patrol lights, signal flares, and the like.

Addendum: While 3777's autonomy can make it challenging to anticipate its behavior or limit its authority, it is not believed to be a threat to human life. Nevertheless, regular monitoring and reprogramming are recommended to ensure its continued safe operation.
