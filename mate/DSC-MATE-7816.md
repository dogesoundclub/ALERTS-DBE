Item #: 7816

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7816 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment chambers at Site-██. He is to be provided with three meals a day and access to a television within the confines of his quarters. Personnel are to avoid engaging in conversation with him unless necessary for research purposes.

Description: Item 7816 is a male, human fast food worker with an unusual appearance. His face is frequently adorned by a wide, friendly smile, and his eyes resemble those of ski goggles. His head is covered in unkempt, bright green hair, and a goggle is frequently found propped on his forehead. He is also known to have adorned himself with a jade earring, a silver chain necklace, and a gas mask.

In addition to his peculiar appearance, Item 7816 exhibits a rebellious attitude that is often associated with his strong sense of independence. He is resistant to authority and may engage in reckless or rebellious behavior, such as taking unauthorized breaks or leaving work early without permission.

Item 7816 was discovered in 20██, after local residents reported sightings of a peculiar fast food employee with 'strange eyes'. Foundation agents apprehended the individual and later identified their anomalous properties. Testing indicates that he possesses no superhuman abilities beyond his unusual appearance and rebellious nature. 

Addendum 7816-1: Personnel are reminded to avoid engaging with Item 7816, even if his friendly demeanor is disarming. Research is ongoing, and any contact with Item 7816 should be carefully monitored and recorded.
