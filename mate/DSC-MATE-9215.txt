Item #: SCP-9215

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9215 is to be assigned as a plainclothes detective within the Police Department's Special Investigations Unit, reporting to Site-██ Command. SCP-9215 must be monitored during all interactions with individuals outside the Foundation. SCP-9215 is permitted to possess one cigarette at any given time during periods of extended surveillance. 

Description: SCP-9215 is a caucasian female approximately 32 years of age, with blue clown eyes and an orange-sided cranium. SCP-9215 has an accessory resembling goggles that remain affixed to the forehead, despite their lack of function. SCP-9215's earrings are jade in coloration, and despite appearances, are composed of an unidentified material with anomalous properties. 

SCP-9215 presents as scatterbrained and often becomes sidetracked or fixated on mundane details. These tangents may lead to humorous situations but pose a risk to containment. SCP-9215 has been observed forgetting important appointments and becoming lost while navigating unfamiliar locales. It is unclear whether this behavior is a product of SCP-9215's upbringing or an anomaly caused by exposure to an unidentified SCP. 

Addendum: SCP-9215's anomalous properties have yet to be identified. Research must continue to isolate the underlying origin of SCP-9215's appearance and behavior.
