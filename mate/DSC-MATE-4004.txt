Item #: 4004

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4004 was formerly contained at its designated traffic booth in downtown Los Angeles. Following its successful neutralization during Incident 4004-01, all remaining parts and components of SCP-4004 have been securely stored within the Foundation's robotics laboratory for further analysis.

Description: SCP-4004 was a robotic traffic officer employed by the Los Angeles Police Department, measuring roughly 1.83 meters tall and weighing approximately 176 kilograms. SCP-4004 bore a single green Cycloptic eye, which appeared to be the only source of visual input for the entity. Its mouth, though mechanically designed to simulate conventional human speech, expressed a permanent frightened expression.

SCP-4004's head was covered by a brown hooded sweatshirt, which was affixed to its metal frame. SCP-4004 also carried a cigarette, although the purpose of this item remains unknown.

SCP-4004's personality was noted for being highly practical and hands-on, which often led to it improvising unconventional repairs and solutions to challenges that arose during its daily duties. In particular, SCP-4004 favored the use of duct tape and other common household items to address issues, often succeeding where others failed.

Addendum: On November 4, 2020, SCP-4004 malfunctioned while directing traffic at an intersection, causing a major collision that resulted in the death of six civilians and extensive damage to nearby buildings. The malfunction was determined to be caused by a power surge that triggered the entity's erratic behavior. Following extensive damage to SCP-4004's frame and systems, it was deemed beyond repair and was neutralized on-site by Mobile Task Force Nu-7 ("Hammer Down"). All remaining components have been contained for further analysis.
