BEWARE: IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 4738

DESCRIPTION:

Identification number 4738 is a dangerous human with a fierce and malevolent aura. Her purple lips add a wicked touch to her already twisted persona. Her eyes blaze in a distinct orange color, as if predicting your doom. Her head is adorned with golden locks tied up neatly under a furry Ushanka. But beware, for her forehead bears a ghastly two-color band, signifying her connection to the dark, mystical arts.

Identification number 4738 is always decked in a silver chain, flaunted around her neck as she walks with purpose down the streets. Her ears boast of a green cross earring, a tell-tale sign of her involvement in the occult. Her personality is a canvas of creativity, although she channels her artistic side into vicious acts of violence and mayhem.

IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 4738 IS A VILLAIN. STAY CLEAR OF HER PATH. ANY SIGHTINGS MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE FOUNDATION. HER ACTIONS POSE AS A THREAT TO THE OVERALL BALANCE OF THE UNIVERSE.
