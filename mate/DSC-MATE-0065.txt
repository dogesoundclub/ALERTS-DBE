Item #: SCP-65

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-65 is to be contained in a standard 3m x 3m living quarters, complete with a television, computer, and any other amenities needed to allow SCP-65 to perform their duties as assigned. The subject is not to exceed two hours of TV or computer use per day. SCP-65 is to be allowed regular communication with their family and friends to ensure their sustained cooperation with the Foundation.

Description: SCP-65 is a human male of average build, standing 1.78m tall. SCP-65 is easily recognizable by his spots and smile, along with his gold earring and silver chain. SCP-65 also wears a purple cap with a headset, and a pair of goggles on his forehead for unknown purposes. SCP-65's eyes are normal, but he wears prescription glasses.

SCP-65 works as a journalist and has demonstrated loyalty and protective instincts toward his family and friends. Despite his laid-back and easy-going demeanor, SCP-65 is capable of becoming aggressive when those close to him are threatened. This has led to humorous situations when SCP-65 engages in arguments with those who insult loved ones.

SCP-65 voluntarily came to the Foundation, claiming to have knowledge of the paranormal events happening around the city. After extensive testing, it was determined that SCP-65 had no anomalous properties or abilities. However, SCP-65 has been useful in providing information about potential SCPs and other anomalous events in the area.

Addendum: SCP-65 has been a cooperative and valuable asset to the Foundation, but caution is advised when engaging in conversations regarding his family or friends. This has been observed to elicit a protective response from SCP-65 that could escalate into violence.
