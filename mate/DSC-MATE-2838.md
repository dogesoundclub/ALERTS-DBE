Item #: 2838

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2838 is to be kept in a secure holding chamber within Site-██. Any interactions with 2838 must be monitored and recorded by a minimum of two Level 3 personnel. Under no circumstances are any visitors or personnel to engage in any kind of argument or debate with 2838.

Description: Item 2838 takes the form of a male Bengal tiger wearing a police cap and sporting red clown eyes. The tiger has a distinctive two-color band on its forehead and a pair of goggles resting on top of the band. It dons a red cross earring on its right ear and always carries a whistle as an accessory.

2838 demonstrates exceptional logical and analytical skills, and enjoys engaging in intellectual debates and arguments for sheer enjoyment. Its personality can lead  it into humorous discussions and debates about trivial and unimportant topics, but these debates can quickly snowball into heated arguments if the other party takes offence.

2838 displays an above-average intelligence level and is quite sophisticated in its mannerisms. However, its attitude towards humans and DSC staff has not always been friendly, leading to multiple incidents that necessitated its isolation in the current containment unit.

Addendum: Item 2838 has been reported to express a strong interest in 'numbers' and 'money.' It has repeatedly requested to handle financial matters but has been denied due to safety concerns. Any requests related to Item 2838's finances must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel before being granted.
