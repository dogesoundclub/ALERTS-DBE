Item #: 6

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6 is to be contained in a specially designed enclosure with reinforced steel walls, electrified fences, and remotely activated tranquilizer darts. The enclosure must be equipped with several surveillance cameras and staff members must monitor the feed at all times. Item 6 is not allowed to interact with any personnel or other objects outside of its enclosure without the express permission of a Level 4 supervisor.

Description: Item 6 is a male tiger with unknown eye color, equipped with a bucket hat and a red cross earring on its left ear. It has an inherent charm and charisma that makes it the center of attention in any social gathering. Item 6's presence can amuse and entertain people with jokes, humorous story-telling, and spontaneous dancing. Despite its amiable personality, it can pose a significant threat to human life due to its predatory instincts.

Item 6's history and origins are still unknown. Currently, the Foundation suspects that Item 6 is a product of an anomalous breeding experiment, given its unusual characteristics. It has shown remarkable resilience to tranquilizers, sedatives, and other forms of chemical containment. Item 6's abilities to manipulate its surroundings and influence human behavior are still under investigation.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, Item 6 managed to escape its enclosure with an unknown method. It managed to break through the electrified fences and incapacitate two guards before disappearing into the nearby forests. A search party was organized, but no sign of Item 6 was found. Further investigation is pending.
