Item #: SCP-3862

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3862 is to be kept at Site-███ in a reinforced cell with a proximity-based tranquilization system installed. Personnel are prohibited from interacting with SCP-3862 without authorization from at least two Level 3 personnel. Any attempts by SCP-3862 to leave the containment area are to be met with immediate force, including lethal measures if necessary.

Description: SCP-3862 is a human male, now identified as a Mafia Boss. SCP-3862 possesses the ability to hypnotize individuals through eye contact, due to the VR Rainbow LED installed in his eyes. This effect only lasts for a short time, estimated to be around 15 minutes for strong-willed individuals. SCP-3862 also carries a red scarf and a cigarette, both of which he never seems to let go of.

SCP-3862 exhibits a natural talent for leadership, which is believed to be one of the reasons he has been able to climb to the top of the mafia organization. He is often seen smiling and exudes confidence, and his voice has been noted to be especially persuasive. SCP-3862 appears to enjoy taking charge of situations, using his charisma and commanding presence to accomplish tasks and manipulate others to his will.

Additional Notes: SCP-3862 is to be considered a high-security risk due to his connections to criminal organizations. While he is currently under Foundation control, his underworld network remains a potential threat. Any information gained from SCP-3862 regarding criminal activities is to be shared with the appropriate law enforcement agencies. It is also recommended that Foundation personnel take caution when interacting with SCP-3862, as his hypnotic abilities make him a dangerous individual.
