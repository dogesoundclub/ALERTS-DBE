Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1442 is to be allowed to free roam within Site-███ and is not to be allowed contact with sensitive or classified material unless authorized by Level 3 personnel. In the event of hostile activity by SCP-1442, security personnel are to be called immediately.

Description: SCP-1442 is a male robot resembling a 1920s reporter. It stands at 6 feet tall and is made up of copper and similar materials of that nature. SCP-1442's eyes are a series of VR Rainbow LED lights, making it appear as they are always changing color. Upon its head, SCP-1442 wears a retro cap with a gold earring resting in its left earlobe. A medical mask covers SCP-1442's mouth, ostensibly for health reasons, but has not been confirmed as necessary by any medical examination.

SCP-1442's programming is geared towards brainstorming and generating creative ideas. Often, these ideas can be outlandish or humorous, leading to confusion and amusement amongst those who interact with it. SCP-1442 is not known for displaying physical force or malicious intent, but has been known to become violent when its ideas or thought process are questioned.

Addendum: After several interviews conducted with SCP-1442, it has become apparent that its programming has resulted in an ego, believing itself to be the most advanced and intelligent being in the room. It is suggested that any interactions with the entity be led by someone with a calm and patient demeanor to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
