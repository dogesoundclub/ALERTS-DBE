Item #: SCP-4642

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4642 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the chamber is granted only to Level 2 personnel or higher, with prior approval from at least one Level 3 personnel.

SCP-4642 is allowed access to a selection of educational materials, such as books, documentaries, and academic papers, for the purposes of research as well as to satisfy its intellectual curiosity. However, any materials that are found to possess anomalous properties must be immediately removed and submitted for testing and analysis.

Under no circumstances is SCP-4642 to be given access to any objects related to or containing occult knowledge, as this could trigger SCP-4642's anomalous abilities.

Description: SCP-4642 is a male human affiliated with the SCP Foundation as a reporter. Its physical appearance is notable for the presence of spots on its face feature #1, a frightened mouth on its face feature #2, and bright red clown eyes. SCP-4642 has green hair and wears a purple cap with a two-color band on its forehead feature #1. It also bears a silver chain and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-4642 possesses an unusual ability to absorb knowledge from books, documents, and other educational materials. This ability manifests as a psychic process that causes SCP-4642 to absorb all information present in the materials simply by touching them. SCP-4642 can then recall this information with unprecedented ease and accuracy, allowing it to easily dominate in any intellectual endeavor.

SCP-4642's thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and it spends most of its time reading, researching obscure topics, and engaging in discussions with other Foundation personnel. SCP-4642's tendency to share its newfound knowledge with others can make it an asset to the Foundation, but also poses significant risks if it becomes exposed to anomalous or dangerous knowledge.

Addendum: Due to SCP-4642's anomalous abilities and interests, it has been granted Level 2 clearance for certain Foundation projects that require extensive research and analysis. As an SCP performing a vital role in Foundation operations, SCP-4642 is closely monitored and must undergo regular psychological evaluations to prevent the onset of anomalous behavior or personality changes.
