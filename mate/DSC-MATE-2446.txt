Item #: SCP-2446

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2446 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-2446 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any attempt at escape must be met with deadly force.

Description: SCP-2446 is a human male with several distinct physical features. His face has numerous spots, and his grin is always present. He wears thick nerd glasses over his green-layered hair and has a green cross earring in his left ear. SCP-2446 also wears a red scarf and can often be seen with a candy stick in his mouth.

SCP-2446 goes by the title "Doctor" and possesses several medical degrees from prestigious universities. SCP-2446 appears to have a strong sense of independence and is often seen refusing help, even when it is needed. This can lead to humorous situations, such as trying to move furniture or refusing to use a map when lost.

SCP-2446 has an abnormal ability to heal injuries with a touch of his hand. The tissue regeneration process is so swift that in some instances, the wound appears to heal instantaneously. The accelerated healing process is not limited to humans, as SCP-2446 has been seen healing animals and other SCPs as well. The exact mechanisms of SCP-2446's ability are unknown.

SCP-2446 has displayed a non-violent nature and has cooperated with Foundation personnel throughout his containment. However, his strong sense of independence raises concerns about potential behavior issues in the future.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-2446 managed to escape containment by slipping out during a routine medical check-up. Due to SCP-2446's anomalous ability, immediate recovery was not possible before SCP-2446 was able to make contact with several SCPs, causing a containment breach. Multiple casualties were sustained before SCP-2446 was located and contained. Security personnel are reminded to remain vigilant for any attempts at escape.
