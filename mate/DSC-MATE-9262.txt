Item #: SCP-9262

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9262 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a reading nook and ample educational materials. There should be no access to televisions or internet for SCP-9262. Interaction with staff is approved, but must be monitored for information regarding the Foundation.

Description: SCP-9262 is a humanoid monkey, standing at 1.83 meters. SCP-9262 identifies as male and has a unique appearance, with a head sporting a mohawk and large gold earrings on his pointed ears. SCP-9262 dresses in human clothing and wears a silver chain and holds a cigarette in times of stress.

SCP-9262's anomalous properties manifest in their thirst for knowledge and desire to share it with others. SCP-9262 can seemingly learn and process knowledge at an accelerated rate and may spend prolonged periods of time reading books, watching educational documentaries or researching obscure topics in the facility library. SCP-9262 is incredibly enthusiastic and passionate when speaking about their researched material, often speaking quickly and excitedly.

SCP-9262's interaction with staff is of particular concern due to the potential for the acquisition of sensitive Foundation knowledge. SCP-9262 has expressed an interest in interviewing Foundation staff in their profession, and as such, access to SCP-9262 may be restricted until further notice.

SCP-9262 has been assigned a Foundation-approved news anchor role, where they may use their talent for sharing accumulated knowledge to inform the public on pre-approved topics. Any deviation from the pre-determined topics will result in the immediate revocation of their news anchor position.

Addendum: SCP-9262 is subject to minimum eight hours of book-reading per day, breaks included. No televisions or internet will be provided, only e-books from The Foundation's database. Any access to computer systems is subject to strict monitoring.
