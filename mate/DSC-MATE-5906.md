Item #: 5906

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5906 is to be contained within a heavily fortified underground bunker at all times. Under no circumstances should any individual attempt to make direct contact with the subject, as it has been confirmed to possess a heightened aggression response. All interactions with the subject must be done via advanced robotic interfaces to ensure proper communication.

Description: Subject 5906 is a male robotic organism, standing at approximately six feet tall. Its most notable feature is a single green cyclops eye that sits above a perpetually frightened mouth. Upon its head, the subject wears a red beanie, as well as a red cross earring on its right ear. The subject's usual appearance is completed with the addition of horn-rimmed glasses and a medical mask.

Subject 5906 has demonstrated an intense level of attention to detail, often bordering on obsessive-compulsive disorder. This particular trait is evident in even the most mundane of situations, such as alphabetizing spice racks, and color-coding closets. It is unclear whether this trait is a result of programming or a product of the subject's unique consciousness.

Of particular concern is the subject's occupation as a mafia boss. As a result of its robotic nature, subject 5906 is capable of extreme levels of violence and has amassed a sizable criminal empire. The Foundation must remain vigilant against any attempts by the subject to expand its influence further.
