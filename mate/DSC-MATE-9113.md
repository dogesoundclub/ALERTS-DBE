Description:

Subject 9113 is a male human of the y-gen species, with distinctive facial features including spots and a perpetually-smiling mouth. They are known to wear thick, "nerd" glasses upon their pale blue eyes, as well as a signature purple cap with built-in headset.

Atop their forehead is a set of goggles, which appear to serve no active purpose but are a permanent fixture during daily life activities. Around their neck hangs a flashy gold chain, almost as if it's an additional form of ID.

Subject 9113 is quick-witted, loves to engage in intellectual debates and often attempts to engage others in playful arguments. At times, this can be humorous for the presiding parties but can also become a bothersome nuisance to those uninterested in engaging the subject. 

Addendum:

Subject 9113 has exhibited no anomalous properties and does not appear to present any imminent threat. As such, they are free to pursue their medical profession and daily passions without further surveillance unless significant changes in behavior warrant more stringent containment measures.
