Item #: 958

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 958 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to its fragile nature, the cell must be reinforced to prevent any accidental breaches. A high-security clearance is required for all personnel who wish to interact with the subject.

Description: Subject 958 is a humanoid entity, appearing as a male rabbit with a unique set of accessories. The subject's eyes are obscured behind horn-rimmed glasses, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. Additionally, subject 958 has an earring on its right ear and is often seen smoking a cigarette. The entity appears to be sentient and can communicate fluently in various languages.

Subject 958 is notorious for its charming personality, which allows it to connect with others on a deep level. This ability can be used to extract personal information from unsuspecting individuals. It is not known if the subject's skills are innate or a result of conditioning, programming, or magical enchantment.

Addendum: Several encounters have revealed that the rabbit banker displays a profound understanding of human psychology, allowing it to manipulate the emotions and behavior of others. Despite its seemingly innocuous appearance, the entity is considered a severe risk for covert intelligence gathering.

As of the last evaluation, subject 958's motivations remain unknown. All attempts to assess its ultimate goal and its agenda have been unsuccessful. Consequently, it is advisable not to grant the subject access to sensitive information, assets, and personnel. Further studies are necessary to determine the full extent of its abilities and to locate the source of its powers.
