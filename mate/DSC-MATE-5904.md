Item #: 5904

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5904 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Direct communication with 5904 is permitted only with the prior approval of Site Director. The cell must be inspected regularly for any anomalies or signs of tampering.

Description: Subject 5904 is a female human of average height and build. 5904's most notable feature is the distinctive orange stripes on her face, which contrast sharply with her 90s brown hair. Her blue clown eyes seem to twinkle mischievously in the light. She sports a gold earring on each ear and a choker around her neck. 5904 almost always wears a medical mask over her mouth, which presumably is meant to prevent the spread of germs.

5904 is a skilled mechanic and has a knack for fixing anything that is brought to her. However, her true talent lies in her great sense of humor, which she often employs to entertain herself and others. 5904 enjoys telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations that can lighten even the most somber of moods. However, she can be quite unpredictable and may turn an otherwise serious situation into a joke.

Addendum: 5904 has shown no signs of hostility or aggressive behavior towards any personnel during its time in containment. However, it is important to note that her sense of humor can be somewhat unpredictable at times, and caution should always be exercised when interacting with her.
