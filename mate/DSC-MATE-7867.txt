Item #: 7867

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7867 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be fitted with reinforced steel walls and be kept under 24-hour surveillance. Any personnel entering SCP-7867's containment chamber must do so with full-body protective gear due to SCP-7867's possession of a hazardous LED gas mask.

Description: SCP-7867 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 4 feet tall. SCP-7867 has vibrant green hair and wears a purple cap on its head. It also has a goggle on its forehead and a silver chain around its neck. SCP-7867 is gifted with the ability to communicate in basic English.

SCP-7867 is a car salesman by profession and often engages in conversations with anyone who visits his containment chamber, offering them his services in exchange of freedom. SCP-7867's personality is scatterbrained, often forgetting important details, getting sidetracked and losing focus. SCP-7867 seems to have a humorous side, with its antics and actions bringing about moments of amusement, despite the danger posed by its LED gas mask.

SCP-7867 seems to have an anomalous effect on car sales, as individuals who purchase vehicles from it often experience luck and fortune. The effect has been commonly noted and observed to persist even after interaction with SCP-7867 has ended. Despite this, SCP-7867's hazardous gas mask has caused significant concern among Foundation personnel, with various incidents of it activating noted in the past. 

Note: Due to the potential danger posed by SCP-7867 and its hazardous mask, MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings") has been put on high alert should any breach attempt occur. Research is ongoing to determine if SCP-7867's abilities can be utilized in controlled environments without causing any hazardous outcome.
