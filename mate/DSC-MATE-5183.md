Item #: 5183

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5183 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-___, with access to the necessary medical equipment and supplies to carry out their duties as a doctor. Due to their rabbit-like appearance, extra precautions must be taken to ensure any personnel entering the chamber are not perceived as a threat. Personal protective equipment and sedation may be necessary in certain situations.

Description: Subject 5183 is a male rabbit-like humanoid with Horned Rim Glasses for eyes, a Doge Hat for a head, and a Gold Earring on each ear. The subject is often seen wearing a Red Scarf as an accessory, but its function is unknown. The subject's appearance may evoke whimsical or child-like sentiments, but do not be deceived by its outward appearance.

Unlike most rabbits, Subject 5183 possesses an exceptional level of detail-orientedness, which at times can be regarded as obsessive. Cases of alphabetization and color-coding are just the tip of the iceberg. Having the ability to memorize countless symptoms, drug interactions, and medical procedures with ease, Subject 5183 is a valuable asset to the Foundation as a medical doctor. 

However, due to Subject 5183's extreme attention to detail and somewhat quirky tendencies, interacting with the subject may require a certain level of patience from personnel. It is not uncommon for the subject to engage in lengthy conversations concerning any medical procedures or equipment in the chamber, even to the point where they may over-explain the mechanics of a simple medical device. Under no circumstances are personnel to criticize or tease Subject 5183 about its unusual characteristics, as the subject has displayed emotional distress in response to such treatment. 

Overall, Subject 5183 is a well-behaved, cooperative humanoid with exceptional medical abilities. Any medical issues within the Foundation may be directed towards Subject 5183 for consultation and treatment.
