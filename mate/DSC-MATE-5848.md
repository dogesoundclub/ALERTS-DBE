Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5848 is to be allowed to continue their occupation as a fast food worker, as long as they remain under surveillance at all times. Any deviation from their behavior or actions must be reported immediately to the designated authorities.

Description: Subject 5848 appears to be a male human of average height and build, with spotted facial features and a perpetually fearful mouth. Their eyes resemble those of ski goggles, and their head is a metallic purple color that seems to flash in sunlight. They wear a gold earring and a red scarf, but their most distinctive accessory is an LED gas mask.

Subject 5848 is known to possess a very analytical and logical personality, which often leads them to engage in debates and arguments with others. Their tendency to argue over even the most trivial of topics can make them a bit of a problem, but also makes for some amusing moments.

Despite their unusual appearance and personality, Subject 5848 has not displayed any anomalous properties that would threaten the safety of others. They are generally cooperative with containment procedures and do not appear to be a threat to those around them.

Addendum: As of ██/██/████, Subject 5848 has been granted limited clearance to access certain Foundation databases for research purposes. All activity within these databases must be monitored at all times.
