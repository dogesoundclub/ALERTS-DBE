Item #: 1017

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1017 is to be kept on active duty as a police officer, with regular therapy sessions to manage her emotional states. A silver chain is to be worn at all times as both a calming mechanism and a way to mark her as a member of the Foundation.

Description: SCP-1017 is a female human with orange stripes on her face, a smile as her second facial feature, and an unusual wing on her blonde head. The subject is also observed wearing a red cross earring and a normal gas mask as accessories.

SCP-1017 displays unique traits that make her stand out from other humans. She exhibits a highly emotional personality and is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. SCP-1017 has also shown a particular fondness for music and art that evoke strong feelings.

It is believed that SCP-1017's unusual appearance and personality are the result of a genetic anomaly or a reaction to anomalous energy. More testing is required to determine the root of her abilities.

SCP-1017 has proven valuable to the Foundation as a police officer. Her empathy and emotional intelligence allow her to de-escalate situations and diffuse conflicts. She is also highly respected by her colleagues for her work.

Addendum: SCP-1017's silver chain contains a small amount of silver that has been proven to calm her emotional state. While silver has no known anomalous properties, it is recommended that other humanoid SCPs with emotional issues wear a silver chain. This may prove beneficial in the future.
