Item #: 5361

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 5361 is to be allowed standard freedom of movement unless otherwise directed by Foundation personnel. Due to their occupation as a firefighter, they are not to be interfered with during emergency situations unless there is a direct threat to anomalous containment. 5361 is to undergo routine psychiatric evaluations to monitor for any signs of anomalous behavior or alteration.

Description: 5361 is a male human of average height and build. Their most notable feature is a distinct and permanent spot on their mouth. This is often complimented by a perpetual smile on their face, which may be interpreted as either genuine happiness or a potential coping mechanism for psychological trauma.

5361 wears a hoodie with a red victory band adorned prominently on their forehead. This is paired with a medical mask placed over their mouth and a red scarf. Their resistance to authority or rules has led to some acts of rebellion, which may be exhibited by impulsive actions or absenteeism from work.

Overall, 5361 is a subject of great interest to the Foundation due to their potential anomalous properties and the danger posed by their occupation in emergency response services.

Addendum: Psychological evaluations have indicated that 5361 displays a high degree of empathy towards others, particularly those in need of assistance. This attribute is an important factor when considering the subject's role as a firefighter and potential for additional anomalous effects. Future monitoring and surveillance of 5361 are crucial to ensure the continued safety of the public and the Foundation's interests.
