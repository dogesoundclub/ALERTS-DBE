Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 8839 has been contained in a secure facility with an area of 15ft x 20ft. The cell walls should be made with at least 5-inch steel to ensure its confinement. An audio/visual tracking system should be installed for continued monitoring. Access to subject 8839 is only granted by personnel with Level 2 security clearance or above. Daily psychological evaluations and physical observations must be performed for any present signs of rebellious behavior. 

Description: 

Subject 8839 is a male monkey with blue clown eyes, an expression of a frightened mouth, and jade earring on its left ear. It dons accessories of a silver chain and a cigarette tightly tucked in its lips. Although the origin of the mutant strain is still unknown, it is clear that its genetics had been affected by an unknown source. 

Subject 8839's behavior indicates a strong sense of independence, and it may not always respond to authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This may sometimes result in acts of insubordination, such as sneaking out of the office early or taking unauthorized days off. 

Addendum:

During the annual round of psychological evaluations, it was noticed that subject 8839 has shown remarkable progress in obedience and cooperative behavior. After reviewing the data, the research team concluded that providing subject 8839 interactive puzzle toys and a healthy diet has remarkably improved the subject's behavior. Hence, it is proposed that providing suitable entertainment equipment and rations can be implemented as part of their containment strategies.
