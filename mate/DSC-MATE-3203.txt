Description: SCP-3203 is a human male of average height and build. It exhibits a unique set of facial and accessory features, including a mouth spot and frightened mouth, ski goggle eyes, a bucket hat, a gold earring, a red scarf, and a cigarette. These features appear permanent and cannot be removed or replaced. Despite its seemingly mundane appearance, SCP-3203 exhibits the unusual trait of forgetting its surroundings and tasks when lost in thought or working on a project.

SCP-3203's programming expertise is highly valued by the Foundation, but its absent-minded nature has led to several security breaches in the past. It is important to monitor SCP-3203's computer activity at all times, as it has shown a tendency to access unauthorized information or attempt to communicate with individuals outside of the Foundation.

SCP-3203's personality is generally good-natured, but it can become easily agitated when distracted or interrupted while programming. It has displayed a disdain for authority and strict rules, leading to confrontations with Foundation staff in the past. Overall, SCP-3203 presents an unusual and potentially dangerous combination of skills and personality traits, requiring constant monitoring and containment for the safety of the Foundation and general public.
