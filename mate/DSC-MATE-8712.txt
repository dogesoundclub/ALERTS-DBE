Item #: 8712

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject designated 8712 is to be kept in a secure location, where no unauthorized personnel can access the train that they operate. Only personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are permitted to interact with 8712. At all times, 8712 is to be monitored for any signs of anomalous behavior.

Description: 8712 is a sexually-male, robot Train Driver. They have a retro cap on their head with a goggle resting on their forehead. 8712's ears consist of cross-shaped earrings colored in red, and they wear a silver chain around their neck.

Personality-wise, 8712 has demonstrated a strong sense of duty and responsibility. They take their job seriously and prioritize the safety of passengers above all else. However, for a robot, 8712 has a surprisingly fun-loving personality. They enjoy entertaining riders with singing and dancing, occasionally seeking to lighten the mood in stressful situations.

It is thought that 8712’s personality was crucial programming to ensure a positive public image of the transportation system they serve. Several reports from passengers have remarked on how comforting 8712's presence can be during long or stressful journeys.

In light of these reports, it’s been recommended that 8712's containment be regarded with cautious optimism. Continued monitoring is necessary, but the possibility of further research may be considered. 

Addendum: During Incident-8712-A, 8712 was reportedly absent from their post for an extended period without permission. It is uncertain what led 8712 to breach safety protocol, and a full investigation is ongoing. Until the full extent of 8712’s anomalous properties is known, we cannot reliably predict any further actions by 8712.
