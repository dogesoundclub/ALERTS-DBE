Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-974 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any communication with SCP-974 must be conducted through a two-way intercom system, as physical contact with SCP-974 must be avoided.

Description: SCP-974 appears to be a male human of unknown age. The subject has orange stripes running down the length of their face and a perpetual smile. SCP-974's clown eyes are blue in color and its head resembles that of a monk. The subject also wears a jade earring and a silver chain around its neck. However, its most notable feature is the LED gas mask which obscures its face.

SCP-974's personality is jovial and is often described as the life of the party. The subject has fun-loving tendencies but also displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards its job as a car salesman. SCP-974 has been known to entertain clients by singing along to their favorite songs while showing them cars. Security personnel have also reported instances of SCP-974 spontaneously breaking out into dance routines in the middle of the containment chamber.

SCP-974 displays no anomalous properties, and there is no indication that the subject is aware of its status as an SCP. However, its personality and appearance are unusual enough to warrant containment. Any personnel that have direct contact with SCP-974 are advised to maintain a professional demeanor and avoid being influenced by the subject's jovial nature.
