Item #: 219

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 219 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Subject 219 is not to be given any objects or living entities to care for under any circumstances, as this may trigger a potential emotional outburst from the subject. Any personnel assigned to interact with Subject 219 must undergo thorough psychological evaluations to ensure their emotional stability.

Description: Subject 219 is a male human of average height and build. The subject has distinctive orange stripes on their face and a frightened expression, which is commonly seen on the subject's mouth. They typically wear normal glasses and a medical mask, and accessorize with a gold chain around their neck. The subject's blonde hair is styled in a normal men's cut, and they wear a red victory band on their forehead.

Subject 219 is known for displaying an unusual level of care and concern toward inanimate objects. This behavior extends to everything from their car, which they have named and decorated, to their plants, which they talk to and consider to be their friends. The subject has even been observed anthropomorphizing their household appliances, often referring to them as "little buddies" and treating them with care and respect.

Despite Subject 219's seemingly harmless tendencies, it is important to understand that these behaviors have the potential to become dangerous if triggered. The subject has been known to display extreme emotional distress when their beloved objects are threatened or harmed, and may lash out violently in response. 

Addendum: It has been suggested that Subject 219's caring nature towards objects may be a form of coping mechanism for unresolved trauma. Further psychological evaluation is required to confirm this theory.
