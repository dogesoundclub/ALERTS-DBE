Item #: DSC-MATE-46

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-46 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with a gas mask and a functioning LED light source. DSC-MATE-46 must be provided with a train engine simulator to keep it occupied.

DSC-MATE-46 is not to be in contact with any other DSCs or Foundation staff, except for Level 3 clearance personnel. All personal interactions and observations must be recorded and reported immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-46 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth, horned rim glasses, a blue bandana on its head, and a jade earring on each ear. It is commonly seen wearing a gold chain and an LED gas mask. DSC-MATE-46 has the ability to operate a train engine and holds the occupation of a train driver.

DSC-MATE-46 displays forgetful and absent-minded behavior, particularly when concentrating on a task. It often becomes lost in thought, which can result in failed appointments and missed events. However, it is skilled in operating the train engine simulator and demonstrates an innate understanding of the task at hand.

DSC-MATE-46's gas mask is a critical accessory. When removed, the molecule composition of the surrounding air causes DSC-MATE-46 to enter a distressed state, accompanied by high pitched vocalizations and physical agitation.

DSC-MATE-46 has shown no signs of telepathy or other anomalous attributes, except for the innate ability to operate the train engine.

Addendum: Incident Report - 46A
On █/██/20██, DSC-MATE-46 was inadvertently exposed to DSC-█. The result of the interaction caused DSC-MATE-46 to become unresponsive and motionless. After twelve hours, DSC-MATE-46 reanimated and became aggressive towards any personnel attempting to interact with it. DSC-MATE-46's behavior was immediately reported and deemed a threat to the Foundation. After sedation was administered, DSC-MATE-46 was transported to an isolated, secured chamber for further study.

DSC-MATE-46’s reaction to DSC-█ has led to a reassessment of its containment procedures, indicating that it should be kept isolated from all other DSCs.
