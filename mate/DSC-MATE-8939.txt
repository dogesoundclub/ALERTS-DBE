Item #: SCP-8939

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8939 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. SCP-8939 is to be provided with a uniform and allowed to maintain their position as a fast food worker until advised otherwise. Personnel are prohibited from engaging with SCP-8939 outside of approved testing procedures.

Description: SCP-8939 appears to be a human male of average height and weight. The subject has orange stripes on their face, a frightened mouth, and wears a doge hat on their head. SCP-8939 has a two-color band on their forehead and a green cross earring on both ears. Despite SCP-8939's unusual appearance, they have no anomalous properties aside from their empathetic personality.

SCP-8939 demonstrates a strong sense of empathy and is often attuned to the emotions of those around them. Their ability to connect with others has led to humorous situations, such as knowing just the right thing to say to make someone feel better or helping others to see the humor in a difficult situation. Despite this, SCP-8939 can become overwhelmed by the emotions of others and must be monitored closely to prevent a containment breach.

Addendum: SCP-8939 has requested to be provided with reading material on emotional regulation and coping mechanisms to better handle their empathic abilities. Requests have been approved by Site Director.
