Item #: DSC-MATE-6188

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6188 is to be monitored during work hours through the use of discreetly-placed cameras in the fast food establishment where it is employed. DSC-MATE-6188 is to be provided with adequate protective gear, including its LED gas mask, to prevent exposure to harmful chemicals and fumes. DSC-MATE-6188 is to be allowed to live in its own residence, provided that it maintains contact with Foundation personnel and does not divulge any confidential information.

Description: DSC-MATE-6188 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. It stands at approximately 1 meter tall and weighs 26 kilograms. DSC-MATE-6188 has normal rabbit-like features, except for its eyes, which are obscured by a pair of glasses. DSC-MATE-6188 also wears a jade earring and a gold chain. DSC-MATE-6188's most distinctive feature is its LED gas mask, which it wears at all times while working.

DSC-MATE-6188's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and reluctance to ask for help, even when it clearly needs it. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as DSC-MATE-6188 trying to move heavy items by itself or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. DSC-MATE-6188's human-like behavior makes it easier to blend in with the public, although its appearance is still striking.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6188 was discovered by the Foundation during a routine inspection of a fast food establishment. Its unusual appearance and behavior caught the attention of Foundation personnel, who discreetly monitored DSC-MATE-6188's movements. After several weeks of observation, DSC-MATE-6188 was deemed a low-level threat to the public and was brought into Foundation custody for further study.

DSC-MATE-6188's LED gas mask is currently being examined by Foundation scientists to determine its origins and potential anomalous properties. If any unusual properties are discovered, DSC-MATE-6188 will be reclassified and its containment procedures will be adjusted accordingly.
