Item #: DSC-MATE-5156

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5156 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██, furnished with a bed, desk, and appropriate personal effects. DSC-MATE-5156 is currently employed as a veterinarian and is permitted to leave Site-██ for work, so long as they are accompanied by at least one armed guard at all times. DSC-MATE-5156 is not to be allowed access to any DSCs due to its spontaneous character and propensity for irresponsible behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-5156 is a human male with a noticeably dark Mouth Spot just below the lower lip, and displays a constant frightened expression. DSC-MATE-5156 possesses bright blue Clown Eyes which are not consistent with any known human eye color. DSC-MATE-5156 is often observed wearing a hoodie and a red scarf as its accessory.

DSC-MATE-5156 displays an incredibly organized and planned approach to life, often creating detailed schedules and routines for each day. However, DSC-MATE-5156 also possesses a spontaneous side which appears to emerge unexpectedly. This spontaneous side has been documented as leading to humorous situations and impromptu adventures.

DSC-MATE-5156 was brought to Foundation attention when it was discovered that it had been hired as a veterinarian by a small zoo in the midwestern United States. DSC-MATE-5156's unpredictable behavior emerged during its employment when it decided on a last-minute costume theme for a zoo event. DSC-MATE-5156's impromptu party planning turned out to be a hit with the other staff and visitors, but its lack of safety precautions led to multiple injuries and the release of several animals.

DSC-MATE-5156 was brought to Foundation attention shortly thereafter and brought into containment for further observation. DSC-MATE-5156 is allowed outside containment for its veterinary work but is to be accompanied by at least one armed guard at all times. DSC-MATE-5156 is not allowed access to any DSCs due to its unpredictable behavior, and future employment decisions must be evaluated with care.
