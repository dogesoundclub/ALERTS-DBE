Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1699 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a train driver, and is to be escorted to and from work by at least two armed guards.

Description: DSC-MATE-1699 is a female human with distinct facial features, including orange stripes and a purple lip. She possesses red clown eyes, a tiara on her head, and a jade earring in her left ear. DSC-MATE-1699's most notable characteristic is a strong sense of intuition, which can occasionally be mistaken for psychic abilities. She has the ability to predict events before they happen, and can sense when someone is upset or anxious.

DSC-MATE-1699's personality is enigmatic, with occasional bursts of manic behavior. Her intuition often puts others at ease or unsettles them, depending on the situation. Attempts to probe deeper into DSC-MATE-1699's psychological makeup have so far been unsuccessful due to her guarded nature and unpredictability.

DSC-MATE-1699 was discovered following reports of strange occurrences on a train service operated by the company where she worked. Passengers who came into contact with DSC-MATE-1699 frequently reported feeling uneasy, as if they were being watched or manipulated. Following a lengthy investigation, the Foundation intervened and identified DSC-MATE-1699 as the source of the disturbances.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1699's abilities have proven to be an asset in certain Foundation operations, particularly those requiring a heightened sense of intuition or awareness. However, her potential for causing unpredictability and instability must be carefully managed. Any personnel exhibiting signs of behavioral changes or exposure to DSC-MATE-1699's intuition must be isolated and monitored closely.
