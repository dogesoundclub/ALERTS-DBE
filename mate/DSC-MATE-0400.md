Subject 400, also known as "The Guard Bunny," is a unique addition to our urban fantasy universe. Don't let this small, fluffy creature fool you - he is a force to be reckoned with. Although he may appear nervous, with a frightened mouth and normal glasses on his warren-like eyes, he is always ready to defend the safety of our facilities. 

Sporting a Doge hat on his head and a jade earring on one ear, he is not your typical bunny rabbit. With a candy stick in hand, he patrols the premises with an air of control and confidence, keeping his cool even during tense situations. 

In terms of personality, The Guard Bunny has a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. His deadpan jokes are surprisingly funny and leave many of us chuckling in his wake. While he may not consider himself the life of the party, he certainly adds a unique spark to our daily operations. 

In conclusion, The Guard Bunny, aka DSC-MATE-400, should not be underestimated. With his unique appearance and humorous personality, he brings a refreshing touch to our otherwise serious work environment.
