Item #: SCP-3408

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3408 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and fed a carnivorous diet once daily. Interaction with SCP-3408 is allowed only under the supervision of at least one senior researcher and the use of a suitable sedative. Any person exposed to SCP-3408 should be monitored for potential alterations in mood and behavior.

Description: SCP-3408 is a tiger of unknown origin that has taken on human-like characteristics. The creature has green hair and is often seen wearing a purple cap and red scarf along with ski goggles over its eyes. SCP-3408 also carries a whistle which is consistently used by the creature in its occupation as a train driver. 

SCP-3408 is viewed as a social butterfly, using its charisma and likability to attract the attention of people it comes into contact with. Its personality has led to humorous situations, as SCP-3408 routinely gets strangers to open up about their personal experiences or share amusing stories that bring people closer together. 

Notably, interactions with SCP-3408 have been known to produce long-term psychological effects in individuals, causing an unusual propensity for empathic responses or changes in persona. Despite these effects, there has been no observed physical danger associated with SCP-3408.

Addendum: Since its captivity, SCP-3408 is known to have cooperated during experiments, agreed to behaviours beyond its self-imposed sense of fairness, and displayed an unexpected cognitive awareness of personal dignity even when no differentiating properties existed regarding the species of participants or quality of life. Researchers are recommended to continue studying the characteristics of SCP-3408, as the creature seems to have higher cognitive abilities than previously thought possible for a non-human counterpart.
