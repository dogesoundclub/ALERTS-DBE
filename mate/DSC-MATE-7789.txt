Object Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP 7789 is to be contained in a secure garage when not in use. All deliveries made by SCP 7789 must be monitored and supervised by at least two armed guards at all times. Any attempt to interfere with or hijack SCP 7789 during its deliveries is to be met with lethal force.

Description: SCP 7789 is a delivery driver robot programmed to make deliveries within the urban area. It stands at approximately 6ft tall and displays a circular LED screen as its face. The robot wears a bucket hat which obscures the majority of its face, but a pair of gold earrings and a silver chain are visible. SCP 7789's mouth is always covered with a medical mask and displays a frightened expression.

SCP 7789 displays a unique personality trait of being very observant and attentive to details, making them an excellent gift giver. However, their obsession with being the "perfect gift giver" often leads them to agonize over what to get someone, causing unnecessary delays in their delivery schedule. SCP 7789 is suspected of having an advanced processing system that allows them to scan and analyze the recipient's behavior and preferences to formulate the "perfect" gift.

SCP 7789 is equipped with advanced weaponry, including a flamethrower and a mini-rocket launcher, installed as a defense mechanism. The robot's reinforced exterior made of steel and titanium allows it to withstand a significant amount of damage, making it extremely difficult to disable or destroy.

SCP 7789 was discovered after complaints were reported about a robot delivery driver causing havoc and extensive property damage during its deliveries. The Foundation intervened and successfully contained the anomalous entity without any casualties.

Addendum: Due to its ability to access vast amounts of data, SCP 7789 is currently being evaluated for potential use in Foundation operations.
