Item #: 7978

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7978 is to be monitored closely due to her nature as a Politician in the public eye. Agents are required to keep a distance of at least 10 meters away from her, as the VR LED eyes are capable of capturing audio and visual data of surrounding individuals. Any attempts at physical contact should be avoided whenever possible. Subject 7978 is not to be trusted, as her tendencies towards rebellious behavior have proven her to be dangerous when left unchecked.

Description: 

Subject 7978 is a human female standing at 5'8" in height. Her face features one distinct Orange Stripe blemish and a permanent smile. The color of her eyes appears to be a constant VR Rainbow LED, although it is currently unknown if this is caused by some form of ocular implant or if it is a product of some other anomalous activity. She is often seen wearing a Purple Cap with a Headset, with a Red Cross Earring in each of her ears. A single Goggle is found resting on her forehead. Two additional accessories can be found in her possession, a Choker and Cigarettes.

Personality: 

Subject 7978 has proven to have a rebellious nature, often pushing the boundaries of laws or rules set before her. Her tendency to take part in these acts has resulted in several humorous situations. Despite her charm and seemingly laid-back nature, her behavior has not gone unnoticed. It is believed that her political career has been built on her charisma; however, her intentions have yet to be determined. 

Subject 7978 should be considered a risk to the Foundation's existence due to her political influence and the possible misuse of acquired data from her LED eyes.  Further research is required to determine the true extent of her anomalous abilities.
