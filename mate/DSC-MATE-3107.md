Item #: 3107

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3107 is to be kept under strict surveillance by Foundation personnel at all times. They are not to be allowed access to any sensitive or classified materials without prior approval. Subject 3107 is to be provided with a secure and comfortable living space and allowed to pursue their career as a lawyer, provided they do not run afoul of the law or reveal any information about the Foundation's activities.

Description: Subject 3107 is a human male of average height and build with short brown hair and neatly trimmed facial hair. They are often seen wearing a short peak cap and nerd glasses, which they claim are necessary for their legal work. Subject 3107 has one jade earring in their left ear and is often seen wearing a red scarf. Their most unusual accessory is an LED gas mask, which they wear when they feel threatened or exposed to toxins.

Subject 3107 has a scattered personality and can be forgetful or easily sidetracked, which can cause some comical incidents. However, this personality trait also makes them hard to predict and potentially dangerous, as they may not remember important security procedures or may inadvertently reveal sensitive information.

Attempts to investigate the nature of subject 3107's abilities or potential anomalous properties have yielded inconclusive results. It is speculated that they possess some form of reality-warping ability, but this has not been confirmed.

Addendum: Subject 3107 has recently expressed an interest in representing the Foundation in legal matters. While this could be beneficial, caution is advised, as subject 3107's loyalties and motivations are uncertain. It is recommended that we monitor their activities closely and be prepared to take action if necessary.
