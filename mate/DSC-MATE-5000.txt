Item #: SCP-5000

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5000 is to be tracked by Foundation agents at all times. Any sightings or interactions of SCP-5000 are to be reported immediately to the nearest containment team. SCP-5000's work as a delivery driver must be monitored to ensure that it does not come into possession of any anomalous objects. Any attempted recruitment or manipulation by rival factions must be preemptively countered.

Description: SCP-5000 is a human male in his mid-twenties who works as a delivery driver for a local courier service. SCP-5000's most distinctive physical features are his red beanie and green cross earring. SCP-5000 is generally pleasant and affable, often sporting a friendly smile. SCP-5000 wears normal glasses and displays no other abnormal physical attributes.

SCP-5000's most notable trait is its natural talent for leadership. SCP-5000 often finds itself assuming control of situations, regardless of the context. SCP-5000's leadership is benign, but it may be problematic in some situations. 

Despite its apparent lack of anomalous properties, SCP-5000 should be considered a potential danger due to the potential for recruitment by rival groups. Due to SCP-5000's natural charisma and leadership abilities, its inclusion in any organization could be catastrophic for the Foundation. 

Addendum: Given SCP-5000's natural proclivities, it is suggested that it be monitored for any signs of anomalous activity or interest in Foundation activities. Should SCP-5000 display a natural proclivity to help the Foundation, it may be considered for future employment.
