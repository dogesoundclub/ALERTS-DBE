Item #: 7046

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: The subject has been neutralized and is no longer a threat to society.

Description: 7046 was a human male of average height and weight. The most notable feature was the Doge hat, worn over the subject's head at all times. The forehead featured a two-color band, which seemed to correspond with the subject's mood. The subject also sported a jade earring in each ear.

The subject was often seen wearing a medical mask over their mouth, which remains unexplained to this day. 7046 was always clad in a red scarf that somehow accentuated their natural charisma.

The subject's personality was infectious, and they had a way of charming everyone around them. This could lead to humorously absurd situations, such as telling jokes that often fell flat or spontaneous impromptu dances. 7046 had a knack for turning the dullest party into an event that would go down in history.

Addendum: Following a raid, 7046 was captured and brought in for questioning. After extensive interviews, it was discovered that the subject was a real estate agent with no connection to any anomalous activity. It is unknown why the subject wore the Doge hat, used the medical mask, and the jade earrings. Regardless, due to their natural charisma and positive personality, the subject was neutralized and freed of all charges.
