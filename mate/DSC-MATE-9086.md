Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9086 is to be monitored at all times and is to be contained within a solitary cell at all times.

Description: Subject 9086, also known as "The Banker," is a human female adorned with orange stripes across her face and a vibrant red lip. Her most notable feature, however, are the red clown eyes, which she is unable to remove. Her head appears to be covered in a wild and unkempt mass of green hair that has not been trimmed in several years. The subject also sports a pair of gold earrings, although their significance is unknown.

Despite her bizarre appearance, The Banker has been noted to possess high levels of intelligence and analytical reasoning, leading her to excel in the field of banking. She has displayed an affinity for quirky humor, often making witty observations or sarcastic remarks in a dry, deadpan manner. However, her unpredictable behavior and tendency towards violence make her an extreme danger to those around her.

It is believed that The Banker's anomalous abilities are tied to her red clown eyes, although the full extent of their power is unknown. Hypotheses range from mind control to reality-warping, although none have been verified.

Further research is required to fully understand the true nature of The Banker and her abilities. Until then, all personnel are advised to maintain a safe distance and avoid any direct communication with the subject.
