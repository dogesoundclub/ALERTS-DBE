Item #: 2072

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2072 is to be tracked by Foundation agents at all times while on duty as a delivery driver. Under no circumstances is anyone to be alone with the subject during their job, as they may become hostile if they feel threatened. In case of an emergency, the location of the subject must be immediately reported to the nearest Foundation facility for proper extraction and containment.

Description: 

Subject 2072 is a male human with red clown eyes and a peak spike on their head. They possess green cross earrings and sport various spots on their face. They constantly wear a medical mask as a form of protection but accessorize with a gold chain. 

Their personality is best described as independent and stubborn. They avoid asking for assistance even when it is evident that they need it, leading to entertaining situations such as attempting to move heavy objects or refusing to use maps when lost. They are highly adaptable and excels in thinking on their feet. 

Subject 2072 can manipulate space and time to his advantage and has an uncanny ability to deliver goods at impossible timelines. It is still unknown how he accomplishes this feat, and research is ongoing to explore this anomaly’s individual reality-bending abilities.

Addendum: During the containment of subject 2072, all attempts to learn more about the origin of their reality-bending abilities have failed. It is recommended that further research is conducted to explore the bounds of subject 2072’s object-manipulation abilities.
