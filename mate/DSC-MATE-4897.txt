Item #: SCP-4897

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4897 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber should be equipped with surveillance cameras and reinforced with materials capable of withstanding blunt force trauma. Any interaction with SCP-4897 should be conducted by at least two personnel.

SCP-4897's daily wardrobe choices must be approved by a Fashion Consultant assigned to Site-██. Access to any clothing or accessories that have not been pre-approved must not be granted to SCP-4897. SCP-4897 must be informed that their containment and interaction procedures are in place for their own protection and for the protection of those around them.

Description: SCP-4897 is a humanoid entity that identifies as a human female. SCP-4897's most notable feature is a series of bright orange stripes that run horizontally across its face. Its eyebrows are also orange, corresponding to the color of the stripes. SCP-4897 appears to be of average height and build for a human female of its age.

SCP-4897's head is covered by a purple cap with a headset attached to it. Two wires extend from the headset to small metallic discs behind SCP-4897's ears. SCP-4897 is often seen wearing a choker around its neck and a normal gas mask over its nose and mouth.

SCP-4897 is a fashion designer by trade and possesses extensive knowledge about various textiles and fabrics. SCP-4897's personality is highly idealistic and tends to have a strong desire to make the world a better place. This occasionally leads to humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that SCP-4897 deems goes against its values.

SCP-4897 has demonstrated an aptitude for hand-to-hand combat and evasion techniques during a breach incident. SCP-4897 was later subdued with minimal damage to containment equipment and personnel, suggesting a need for durable materials to be utilized in its containment chamber.

Addendum: Future fashion consults regarding SCP-4897's clothing choices are to be conducted by Dr. █████, who has demonstrated a keen understanding of SCP-4897's taste in fashion. Any and all complaints about wardrobe options should be brought to their attention.
