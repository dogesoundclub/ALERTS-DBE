Item #: SCP-1640

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1640 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with a comfortable bed, a desk, and a small television. All interviews and interactions with SCP-1640 must be monitored by at least two Foundation personnel. SCP-1640 is allowed to receive weekly visits from a Foundation-approved therapist to ensure they do not experience any negative effects from their abilities. Any attempts by SCP-1640 to use their empathy to sway the opinions or actions of Foundation personnel must be immediately reported to a supervisor.

Description: SCP-1640 is a male human of average height and build. Their most distinctive feature is their frightened mouth, which is constantly twitching and trembling, as well as their red clown eyes. SCP-1640 wears a purple cap with a headset, a two-color band on their forehead, and a jade earring in each ear. SCP-1640 also wears a silver chain around their neck and is often seen holding a candy stick.

SCP-1640 possesses the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others. They have a strong sense of empathy and are able to read the emotions of those around them with great accuracy. SCP-1640 can amplify emotions or completely change them to the opposite emotion. SCP-1640 is able to choose the intensity of the emotion they cause, from a slight mood lift to a full-blown emotional outburst.

While SCP-1640's abilities can be helpful in certain situations, they must be closely monitored to prevent misuse. SCP-1640 has been known to use their abilities to manipulate others and gain power and control over them. Foundation personnel must remain vigilant to ensure SCP-1640 does not use their abilities for personal gain.

SCP-1640's empathic abilities have also been known to cause humorous situations, where they know just the right thing to say to make someone feel better or help others see the humor in difficult situations. However, SCP-1640's abilities must be taken seriously and any attempts to exploit them must be reported immediately.
