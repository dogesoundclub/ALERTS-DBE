Item #: SCP-5533

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5533 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not under observation. Any requests for social or recreational activities must be approved by Level-3 personnel or higher. SCP-5533 is prohibited from accessing any form of electronic communication or technology, due to its ability to manipulate them to its advantage.

Description: SCP-5533 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis which manifests a human-like appearance. SCP-5533 is approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighs approximately 25 kilograms. SCP-5533 wears a purple cap with a headset, jade earring, shade glasses, and red scarf. SCP-5533 also carries a cigarette with it at all times.

SCP-5533 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, traits that it has possibly gained from its former occupation as a lawyer. However, SCP-5533 also knows how to have fun by displaying humorous antics and dance moves during social events. These strange behaviors can have powerful psychological effects on those who witness them. As such, it is recommended that SCP-5533 be kept away from large crowds and social events.

SCP-5533 is capable of manipulating electronic devices to its advantage. It has been observed to enter secure databases and review confidential information without being detected. SCP-5533's true motives are unknown and it is possible that it may pose a threat to the Foundation's security protocols.

Addendum: SCP-5533 was apprehended by the Foundation after reports of a monkey in a business suit disrupting court proceedings. SCP-5533 was captured and transported to Site-██ without incident. SCP-5533's former clients have all refused to speak about its behavior or practices. Further investigation is ongoing.
