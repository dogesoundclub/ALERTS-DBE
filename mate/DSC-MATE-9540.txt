SCP Foundation Containment Report - SCP-9540 "The Fashionista"

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9540 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The subject's access to any fashion-related materials is prohibited. Daily psychological evaluations must be conducted to ensure SCP-9540's compliance and mental stability.

Description: SCP-9540 is a male human with a unique appearance. The subject has spots covering their face feature #1 and sports VR Rainbow LED eyes. He is often seen wearing a red beanie on his head, gold earring on his ears, and a medical mask covering his mouth. His signature accessory is a red scarf.

SCP-9540 is a fashion designer by trade, known for creating extraordinary and avant-garde clothing designs. However, this creativity and individuality have its consequences. SCP-9540 has manifested anomalous properties, causing anyone who wears the clothing he designs to experience intense and dangerous hallucinations.

SCP-9540 is highly social and values harmony among his peers. He has a goofy side and often engages in playful banter or tells jokes with others. It is unknown at this time if SCP-9540's affable disposition is part of his inherent personality or a manifestation of his anomalous properties.

SCP-9540's containment is crucial to prevent any further harm to the public, and any attempts to disseminate his designs must be immediately reported to the SCP Foundation for confiscation.

Addendum: Psychological evaluations reveal that SCP-9540's anomalous properties may be a result of suffering from a severe form of synesthesia, coupled with powerfully empathic abilities. These abilities manifest in his fashion creations, leading to the wearer's hallucinations. Further research is deemed necessary to determine if SCP-9540 can control these abilities and if it is possible to create clothing designs that do not pose a danger to the public.
