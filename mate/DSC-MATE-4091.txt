Item #: SCP-4091

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4091 is to be contained within a secure location and is allowed internet access only when authorized. Individual monitoring is not deemed necessary at this time, as SCP-4091 has shown no indication of posing a threat to Foundation secrecy.

Description: SCP-4091 appears to be a human female in her mid-20s, working as a programmer in the IT industry. She has a distinctive feature of a purple lip and wears normal glasses. She also wears a medical mask over her mouth and a gold chain as an accessory. An audible ticking noise has been reported when SCP-4091 is present.

SCP-4091 displays empathetic and compassionate tendencies and is able to pick up on the emotions of others with ease. While admirable, this also results in SCP-4091 taking on other people's problems as her own. This sense of responsibility can lead to exhaustion and the need for extended periods of rest.

SCP-4091's red cross earring may have significance to her, however, its true nature is yet to be confirmed.

Investigation and surveillance of SCP-4091 is ongoing. Any abnormal activity is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.
