Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5134 is to be monitored at all times, with a designated observer responsible for reporting any unusual behavior or utterances. No physical contact or direct communication with 5134 is permitted, with all contact or communication taking place via intercom or other forms of remote communication.

Description: Subject 5134 is a humanoid creature commonly identified as a politician. Despite possessing a human appearance, 5134 is considered to be anomalous due to its unique facial and cranial features. 5134 has a distinct mouth spot on its face, and its frightened mouth adds to its overall unsettling appearance. Its clown-like red eyes only serve to heighten its otherworldly nature.

In addition to its facial features, 5134 has a goggle affixed to its forehead and a green cross earring dangling from one ear. Its mouth is invariably covered by a medical mask, possibly as a precautionary measure to conceal any additional abnormalities.

Despite its alarming physical attributes, 5134 exhibits a creative and artistic side that may manifest through several hobbies or interests. Its preferred forms of artistic expression may range from painting, drawing, writing, or other outlets.

It should be noted that 5134 is considered capable of inducing fear and panic in its surroundings, often leading to mass hysteria and unrest. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of its abilities and potential threats to public safety.

Addendum: Several unconfirmed reports have suggested that 5134 has undergone additional modifications, leading to the development of further anomalous traits such as mind control and perception manipulation. These reports are considered speculative at this time, but additional investigations are underway to verify their validity.
