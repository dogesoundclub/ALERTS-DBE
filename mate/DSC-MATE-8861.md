Subject 8861 possesses an idealistic personality, which is atypical for the species. It exhibits a strong desire to make the world a better place, which sometimes leads to humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting companies or causes that it feels opposed to its values.

Addendum: During a routine checkup of Subject 8861, staff noticed an unusual phenomenon. The subject's medical mask appeared to be causing a small dimensional rift on its face. Further investigation revealed that the mask had been imbued with anomalous properties, which allowed the subject to communicate telepathically with other sentient beings. The extent of this ability is still under review, and research is ongoing.
