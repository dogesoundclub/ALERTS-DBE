Description: DSC-MATE-6404 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. Despite its small stature, DSC-MATE-6404 has demonstrated an uncanny ability to make deliveries throughout the city without being detected by surveillance systems or human observers. DSC-MATE-6404's eyes are modified with VR Rainbow LED implants, allowing it to see in the dark and track its surroundings with exceptional accuracy.

DSC-MATE-6404 can often be seen wearing a red beanie on its head along with a gold chain around its neck. It possesses a whistle that it uses to signal its presence to anyone in the vicinity. DSC-MATE-6404 has a deep curiosity about the world and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics, which often leads to it spouting off random trivia and facts to others.

DSC-MATE-6404's ability to deliver packages and parcels with remarkable efficiency has led to speculation that it possesses an anomalous trait or ability that has yet to be fully understood. However, despite extensive research and experimentation, no conclusive evidence of any such ability has been found. Therefore, DSC-MATE-6404 is currently classified as a Safe anomaly and continues to be monitored under the foundation's containment protocols.
