Item #: SCP-1830

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1830 is to be contained within a rural farming community and monitored by undercover agents. Interaction with SCP-1830 must be authorized and supervised by a Level 3 personnel. SCP-1830 must be provided with necessary resources such as food, water, and shelter in return for her agricultural services.

Description: SCP-1830 is a Female Human with several distinguishing physical features. Her face is covered in numerous spots, and she wears bright red lipstick. SCP-1830 has blue clown eyes that have been observed to produce a mild hypnotic effect on certain individuals. Her head is covered in blonde hair, usually worn under an Ushanka. SCP-1830's most prominent ear is adorned with a gold earring. SCP-1830 is constantly seen with a cigarette in her hand or mouth.

SCP-1830 demonstrates exceptional practicality and resourcefulness in her approach to problem-solving. She frequently relies on unconventional methods and ad-hoc solutions to address issues that others find challenging. Such behaviors have led to numerous anomalous phenomena within her immediate surroundings.

In addition to her pragmatic aptitudes, SCP-1830 has displayed advanced agricultural skills, including crop selection, cultivation, and animal husbandry. SCP-1830's farming activities result in an overabundance of high yield crops and livestock, defying conventional capabilities of a single person or farm.

SCP-1830's anomalous properties manifest themselves as an anomalous force that alters reality based on her practical solutions to mundane problems. This force appears capable of creating temporary reality warps or mild alterations in the laws of physics that fade away after a short period. These alterations have been observed as harmless or explicitly beneficial to the environment surrounding SCP-1830.

Addendum: SCP-1830 has displayed obedience and compliance to the Foundation's tasks for providing her with the necessary resources to continue her farming activities. The Foundation is currently investigating the nature of SCP-1830's anomalous abilities and the possible application of these phenomena in broader scenarios.
