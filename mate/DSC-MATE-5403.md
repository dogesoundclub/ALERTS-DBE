Item #: 5403

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 5403 must be monitored at all times by a designated Individual with Level 4 clearance. Interference with their programming is not advisable, as it may lead to catastrophic consequences. Officers must approach 5403 with caution and follow all given orders.

Description: Officer 5403 is a sentient robot designed by the Foundation to carry out law enforcement activities on behalf of the citizens of the city. The robot stands approximately 6-feet tall and often wears a golden chain and a doge hat, giving the false impression of being a mere gimmick.

Despite its jovial appearance, Officer 5403 is equipped with some formidable functions that make it a force to be reckoned with. Its signature move is a high-tech gas mask that grants immunity against air contamination while providing a clear visual of its surroundings. The robot's standout feature is undoubtedly its green Cyclops eye that can scan up to a 10-mile radius and pin the location of individuals harboring unlawful intentions.

Officer 5403 specifications designate it as male, and its personality is driven by a high capacity for organization and efficiency that can make it appear demanding at times. It is programmed to take charge of critical situations, and its matter-of-fact delegation style often leads to humorous outcomes.

Although 5403 is a machine, it carries the same obligation towards its duty as a human, and falters only in its allegiance to the Foundation's goals. Its perception of right and wrong is limited to human law and its instincts, which, without proper channeling, may lead to authorization blunders.

Addendum: Following reports of malfunctions, Officer 5403 has been temporarily decommissioned and subjected to various software upgrades. It is unclear whether the upgrades will remedy the malfunctions.
