Item #: 8787

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be contained within the ranks of the local police force in [REDACTED]. Any anomalies observed in the subject's appearance or behavior should be reported to the Foundation without delay. Interaction with the subject outside of official business is prohibited.

Description: Subject 8787 is a male human of average height and build, sporting a peculiar combination of physical features. Most strikingly, the subject's mouth bears a dark spot resembling a birthmark, possibly indicating a genetic abnormality. The subject's eyes are covered by a pair of ski goggles at all times, negating any attempt at visual identification. The subject's head is also noteworthy, as it appears to be entirely made of a metallic, purple material. Similarly strange are the subject's ears, pierced with a pair of green cross earrings. The subject regularly wears a medical mask covering the lower half of their face, ostensibly for health reasons. Finally, the subject is never seen without a thick gold chain around their neck.

Despite their unique appearance, the subject leads an otherwise ordinary life as a police officer in [REDACTED]. The subject's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence, which has led to various amusing situations in their personal and professional life. However, the subject's reluctance to ask for help may also make them prone to dangerous situations, which should be taken into account when interacting with the subject.

Addendum 8787-01: Further investigation into Subject 8787's unusual features and behavior has revealed no evidence of supernatural or anomalous properties. However, due to their unusual appearance, the subject is to be surveilled and monitored to ensure that their presence does not attract unwanted attention.
