Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3324 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with basic amenities such as a bed, a table, and a chair. It is not to be allowed any access to additional crafting materials, art supplies, or tools unless approved by a Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: DSC-MATE-3324 is a female human with a knack for fashion designing. The subject's face displays multiple spotted markings, which are believed to be the result of an atypical skin condition or a genetic mutation. DSC-MATE-3324 habitually wears a tiara on her head and a pair of jade earrings in her ears. It also wears a silver chain around its neck and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-3324's personality has been described as absent-minded and forgetful, particularly when preoccupied with its creative work. It has a tendency to lose track of time and miss appointments, which has resulted in a few humorous incidents. These traits have led to significant difficulties in creating long-term containment protocols for DSC-MATE-3324, as well as its ability to manipulate its environment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3324's fashion designs have been noted for their peculiar properties, particularly the effects they seem to have on those who wear them. Reports have suggested that its clothing alters the personality traits of those who wear them, leading to potential psychological or physical harm. Further research and testing are required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3324's anomalous properties.
