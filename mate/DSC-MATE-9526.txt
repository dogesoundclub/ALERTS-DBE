SCP-9526, also known as "News Hopper", is a male rabbit with VR Jade LED eyes and a signature bucket hat atop his head. Despite his cute and cuddly appearance, 9526 is a seasoned news anchor with a passion for getting the story first.

However, this reporter also has a wild and impulsive side, leading him to act before thinking about the consequences. 9526's recklessness has often resulted in him getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to impress or show off to others.

It is important to note that while his behavior may seem humorous, caution must be exercised when interacting with SCP-9526. As a species, rabbits possess traits such as agility and speed which 9526 has honed over the years, making him a formidable opponent when provoked.

All personnel are advised to approach SCP-9526 with caution and supervise any interactions with this unique anomaly.
