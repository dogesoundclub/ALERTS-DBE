Item #: SCP-1384

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1384 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to the low risk posed by SCP-1384, special restrictions are not necessary. SCP-1384 is to be allowed one hour of recreational time each day, during which it may engage in activities such as gardening or reading.

Description: SCP-1384 is a female human of unknown age, with spots covering its face and a constant smile. SCP-1384's eyes are red in color, resembling those of a clown. SCP-1384's forehead features a two-color band, and its ears have a green cross earring. SCP-1384 frequently wears a medical mask over its mouth and a choker around its neck.

SCP-1384 displays an unusually high level of charisma and has an apparent ability to connect with others on a deep level. Interviews with SCP-1384 have revealed its capacity to get strangers to open up about their life stories or share funny anecdotes, resulting in individuals feeling closer together. SCP-1384 appears to be unaware of this ability and displays no anomalous effects during these interactions.

SCP-1384 was discovered working as a farmer in the rural town of ████████. Local reports described strange occurrences, such as increased crop yields and livestock production, in areas where SCP-1384 had been working. Foundation agents were sent to investigate, and SCP-1384 was identified as the source of the anomalous activity. SCP-1384 was successfully contained without incident.

Addendum: Due to SCP-1384's ability to form connections with individuals in close proximity, further research is ongoing to assess its potential application in social engineering and psychological manipulation. However, testing is to be conducted with caution and ethical standards must be upheld.
