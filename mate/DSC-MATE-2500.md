Dr. ██████████: Good morning, DSC-MATE-2500. Can you tell me a bit about your routine as a veterinarian?

DSC-MATE-2500: Of course, Doctor. I wake up at 6 a.m. and have a cup of coffee before driving to the clinic. I check on my patients and team before starting my day of appointments.

Dr. ██████████: I see. How do you handle unexpected situations or changes in your routine?
