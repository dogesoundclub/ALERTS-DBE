Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3635 must remain contained in a secure animal containment facility in Site-██. No personnel are to enter its containment chamber alone, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-3635 must be approved by at least two Level-2 personnel. 

Description: DSC-MATE-3635 is a macaque monkey, measuring approximately 45 centimeters in height and 70 centimeters in length. DSC-MATE-3635 is distinguishable from other macaques due to its mohawk hairstyle on its head, and its fashion accessories, which include shade glasses, goggles, and a silver chain.

DSC-MATE-3635 has a contagious and charming personality, often making others laugh with its humorous behavior, silly jokes, and impersonations. Its humor can be infectious, leading to a temporary loss of restraint or emotional control in those who come into contact with it.

DSC-MATE-3635 also has a habit of smoking cigarettes, which it has acquired from observing human behavior. It will often use its haphazardly styled hair as a lighter.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-3635's constant attempts to engage in conversation and display its humor, several site personnel have reported difficulty maintaining a professional demeanor while working in its containment area. Extra supervision has been put in place to ensure that no unauthorized interactions with DSC-MATE-3635 occur.
