Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9648 is to be employed as an electrician in Site-19. SCP-9648's anomalous effects are to be monitored closely by on-site staff. SCP-9648 is granted full access to electrical systems as needed but must be supervised by a Foundation employee during any maintenance work.

Description: SCP-9648 is a female human with distinct features that set her apart from non-anomalous humans. SCP-9648 has spots on her face, blue clown eyes, and green hair that appears disheveled and not arranged. On her forehead, SCP-9648 is frequently seen wearing a pair of goggles. The most notable feature of SCP-9648 is a red cross earring worn in her left ear. SCP-9648 is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck.

SCP-9648's personality is noted by staff members to be cooperative and extroverted. They have a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but they also know how to let loose and have fun. This can lead to humorous situations, such as surprising others with their dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor at social events. SCP-9648 has a strong affinity for all things electrical, which is the source of its anomalous properties.

SCP-9648's anomalous effects manifest when they are in contact with any electrical system. SCP-9648 has the ability to manipulate the electrical energy within a system, allowing their work to be performed more efficiently and with greater ease. SCP-9648 is also capable of repairing even the most complicated electrical devices with minimal effort. SCP-9648's capabilities far exceed the skills of a typical electrician.

Addendum-1: SCP-9648's abilities were discovered after they were hired by the Foundation to work at Site-19. SCP-9648 has been cooperative with testing and has demonstrated a willingness to help the Foundation in any way possible. SCP-9648's abilities are to be utilized to their full potential while ensuring that Foundation employees remain safe and SCP-9648 is not exposed to any hazardous circumstances.

Addendum-2: SCP-9648 has indicated that they have no knowledge of any anomalous abilities and believes its electrical proficiency is simply a result of being "good at their job." SCP-9648 has not demonstrated any signs of hostility or malicious intent towards Foundation staff members. SCP-9648 is to be monitored closely for any changes in behavior or abilities.
