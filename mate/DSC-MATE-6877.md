Item #: DSC-MATE-6877

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6877 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a radio and speakers to provide communication with DSC-MATE-6877. DSC-MATE-6877 is allowed to keep its candy stick as a comfort item, but it must be regularly examined for any anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-6877 is only allowed to communicate with staff through the provided communication system or during supervised interviews. Any attempt by DSC-MATE-6877 to leave its containment cell must be met with immediate detainment.

Description: DSC-MATE-6877 is a male simian resembling a common marmoset, with a frightened expression on its mouth. DSC-MATE-6877 is wearing a headset with LED lights, and its forehead has two color bands and goggles resting on top. Its eyes appear to be normal for a marmoset, but further examination is difficult due to DSC-MATE-6877's frightened demeanor.

DSC-MATE-6877's anomalous abilities manifest in its profession as a reporter. It has an uncanny ability to predict upcoming events with extreme accuracy, but it is unable to communicate this information in any way other than through its reporting. DSC-MATE-6877's reporting is always accurate, but it is presented in a disorganized and often frustrating manner. DSC-MATE-6877 is also known to have difficulties accepting new ideas, leading to humorous situations when unexpected events occur.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6877 was recovered in [REDACTED] after causing a panic during a news broadcast. It is suspected that DSC-MATE-6877 was attempting to warn the public of an upcoming catastrophic event, but due to its limited communication abilities and disorganized delivery, it was not taken seriously. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-6877's abilities.
