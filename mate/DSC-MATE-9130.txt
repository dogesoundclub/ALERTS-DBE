Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9130 is to be kept in a secure facility, with a team of trained handlers and medical staff on standby.

Description: Subject 9130 is a male monkey approximately 1.2 meters tall, with a frightened expression on its mouth and blue clown eyes. Its head is covered with black hair, and it has a two-color band on its forehead. It also wears a silver chain as an accessory.

Subject 9130 is a train driver by profession, and may have basic knowledge of train operations and mechanics. However, due to its unpredictable nature and potential danger to itself and others, it is not allowed to operate any machinery or vehicles.

The subject has a nurturing and caring personality, sometimes to the point of treating its friends and family as if they were its own children. This can lead to humorous and awkward situations, but also makes it more vulnerable to emotional manipulation or blackmail.

Addendum: Subject 9130 was recovered from a circus where it had been trained to perform various tricks and stunts. It is suspected that the subject underwent some form of genetic or cybernetic modification to enhance its cognitive and physical abilities. Investigations are ongoing to determine the origins and purpose of such modifications.
