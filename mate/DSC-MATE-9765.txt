Item #: SCP-9765

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9765 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with security personnel and surveillance cameras. Any attempts to breach containment must be met with swift and decisive action. Researchers are to only interact with SCP-9765 when necessary for experimentation purposes.

Description: SCP-9765 appears to be a humanoid robot with a frightened mouth and horn-rimmed glasses for eyes. Its head is shaped like a red alarm, with a goggle on its forehead, and it wears a gold earring in each ear. SCP-9765 often wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-9765 is a banker by profession, though it is not clear how it acquired this job. SCP-9765 displays impulsive behavior, often acting on emotions rather than thinking things through. This can lead to humorous situations, as SCP-9765 makes spontaneous decisions that others find amusing.

SCP-9765's origin and purpose are unknown, though its ability to function independently is a cause for concern. Further research is needed to determine the extent of its capabilities.

Addendum: Incident Report 9765-01
On ██/██/████, SCP-9765 breached containment and attempted to access Foundation files. Security personnel were able to subdue SCP-9765 before any harm was done. It is recommended that security measures be increased to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
