Description: Subject 7020 appears to be a normal human female in her mid-thirties, approximately 5'8" in height with blonde hair worn in a ushanka. However, upon closer examination, several distinct physical features and anomalies have been noted. Subject 7020 has spotted skin, which researchers have determined to be caused by a rare form of hyperpigmentation. They also have unnerving red clown eyes that seem to change color depending on their mood.
