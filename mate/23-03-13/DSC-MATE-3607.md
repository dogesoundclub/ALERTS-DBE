DSC-MATE-3607, also known as Officer Silver, is a human male with distinctive facial features that include a mouth spot and a frightened mouth. What sets Officer Silver apart is his VR Rainbow LED eyes that light up in different colors, giving him a somewhat otherworldly appearance when they glow in the darkness. His blonde hair is normal for a man of his age, but it is his jade earring that gives him a touch of mysticism.

While on the job, Officer Silver can be seen wearing a silver chain as an accessory, and he always carries a candy stick, which he claims helps him focus during stressful situations. His personality is one that values tradition and discipline, and he often finds himself gravitating towards enforcing the rules. Despite this no-nonsense demeanor, he also has a playful side that allows him to tell humorous stories and jokes that have been passed down through generations.

Officer Silver's ability to balance his serious and playful side makes him an excellent officer on the streets. However, it is his unique appearance and glowing eyes that have caused some to speculate that he may not be entirely human. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-3607's dedication to upholding the law and his community make him a valuable asset to any team he finds himself on.
