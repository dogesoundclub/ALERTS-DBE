DogeSoundClub Description:

Subject 355 is a human male of average height with distinct facial features. The subject is easily identifiable by the numerous spots that dot his face and the constantly frightened expression on his mouth. The subject's eyes are obscured by normal glasses, making it difficult to determine their true identity. Subject 355 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, which is believed to be associated with their job as a delivery driver.

On the subject's forehead, there is a two-color band that is often mistaken for a birthmark. The subject also wears a jade earring in their left ear, which glows with an unusual iridescence. Subject 355 often carries a gas mask, which they wear as a protective measure during their deliveries.

Despite their physical appearance, subject 355 has a quirky personality and is known to have a great sense of humor. They enjoy making others laugh and often tell funny stories or do silly impersonations to lighten the mood. While this behavior may seem harmless, some suspect that it is a coping mechanism for the subject's mysterious past.

Further investigation into subject 355's history is recommended, as their unique appearance and jovial nature may be concealing something more sinister. Until such time, subject 355 should be monitored closely and any unusual behavior should be reported to superiors immediately.
