Subject 4368, also known as "The Security Guard," is a male monkey of unknown origin who has been appointed to guard and monitor certain areas of the urban landscape. He stands at about 3 feet tall and is often seen with his signature purple cap, complete with a headset and a pair of nerdy glasses that adorn his curious eyes. 

In addition, subject 4368 always wears a gold chain and carries a candy stick with him. He is highly organized and extremely efficient, which often leads to him taking on leadership roles in group projects or events. Sometimes, his control-freak tendencies get the better of him, causing him to come off as bossy or overbearing.

Despite his quirks, subject 4368 is admired for his reliability and his ability to get things done. He is highly observant and takes his role as a security guard very seriously, ensuring that the areas under his watch remain free from any suspicious or nefarious activity. 

However, there have been reports of subject 4368 developing a strange affinity for human technology, with some even claiming that he has the ability to control certain devices with his mind. While these rumors have yet to be substantiated, it is clear that subject 4368 is not your average monkey - and there may be much more to him than meets the eye.
