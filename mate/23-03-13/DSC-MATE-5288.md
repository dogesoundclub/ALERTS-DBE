Secure. Contain. Protect.

Subject 5288 is a human male, working as a firefighter in the city. The subject displays a unique appearance, with orange stripes adorning his face and a green cross earring adorning his ears. His head is covered in green hair and a purple cap, with goggles situated on his forehead. The subject's eyes are obscured by nerd glasses and his mouth is covered by a medical mask. A substantial gold chain is also present around the subject's neck.

While seemingly mundane, the subject's obsession with detail can lead to unexpected behaviors. The subject has been known to alphabetize their spice rack and color-code their closet. Such behavior could be indicative of a larger compulsion or underlying anxiety. Further observation and analysis of the subject's behavior patterns are required to determine the extent of their disorder.

Until further notice, subject 5288 is to be monitored by our agents for any abnormal behavior or deviation from their established routine. Containment procedures include surveillance and the use of psychological evaluations to monitor mental stability. All personnel should be aware of the subject's attention to detail when interacting with them, as it may trigger anxiety or other psychological symptoms.
