Description:

DSC-MATE-9715 is a female human, approximately 29 years of age, with various unique features. These include multicolored spots on their face, blue clown eyes, and a rainbow festival hairstyle. DSC-MATE-9715 also has a two-color band and goggles on their forehead and a green cross earring. They are regularly seen wearing a silver chain and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-9715 has a laid-back and easy-going personality, but they are fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. DSC-MATE-9715 will engage in heated arguments with anyone who insults their family or friends. This tendency for protection can lead to humorous situations that can arise from misidentifying instances of danger.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-9715 was initially discovered working at a fast-food establishment in [REDACTED], where they drew attention for their unique appearance. Requesting retrieval of DSC-MATE-9715 was met with resistance but was ultimately successful. DSC-MATE-9715 has cooperated fully since their containment, but any attempts to encourage them to change their appearance are to be avoided for fear of upsetting their fragile mental state.
