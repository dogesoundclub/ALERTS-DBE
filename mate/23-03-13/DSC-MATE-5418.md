DSC-MATE-5418, also known by his human name of Edgar, is a theater manager located in the downtown district. Despite his unassuming appearance, there is an air of mystery surrounding this individual.

Edgar's pointed ears are adorned with a green cross earring, and he often wears a monk's hood over his head. His eyes are hidden behind thick, nerdy glasses that are said to possess a peculiar, reflective quality. The jingle of his gold chain can often be heard as he moves about, and he is rarely seen without a candy stick in his hand.

Further investigation has uncovered that Edgar possesses an undeniably nurturing personality, one that flows freely and seems to affect those around him. Persons who enter his presence often describe feeling an inexplicable sense of comfort and safety, as though he has taken them under his wing.

While this trait is generally regarded as harmless, there have been isolated reports of individuals becoming overly attached to Edgar, treating him as a parent figure and growing upset or even violent when he is not around. As such, caution is advised when interacting with this individual.
