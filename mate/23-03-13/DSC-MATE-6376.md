DSC-MATE-6376 is a humanoid farmer assigned for observation in our urban fantasy universe. This female specimen is identified by her striking face features, including charming spots and a captivating smile that are sure to disarm any onlooker. However, visual contact is limited due to the rugged hoodie covering her head and the suffocating medical mask obstructing her mouth.

DSC-MATE-6376 is often seen sporting a familiar emblem of enslavement - a choker - which is a red flag for a deeper history that still requires further investigation. While the farmer's primary function is to tend to crops, DSC-MATE-6376 stands out from its peers through its ingenuity - fixing things with unconventional solutions that other operatives may never consider. Such quick-wittedness may prove helpful in the future - or lead to dangers we have yet to encounter. Approach with caution.
