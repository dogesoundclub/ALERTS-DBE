Item #: 1002

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Item #1002 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its ability to persuade others, it is not to be let out of containment unless given strict permission by authorized personnel. At no time should Item #1002 have access to any kind of electronics, or any material used in personal grooming.

Description:

Item #1002 is a fashion designer named "Beppo." It is a male capuchin monkey, standing roughly two feet tall. Beppo has an unusual fashion sense, wearing a police cap, shade glasses, a goggle worn across his forehead as well as a red scarf and a candy stick.

It has an extremely energetic and enthusiastic personality, frequently hyping up and promoting its clothing designs to others. Despite this, it has a rather sadistic sense of humor and enjoys pranking or causing mischief whenever it can get away with it.

Although Item #1002 can be useful in designing clothing for undercover S.I.E.G.E. agents or as an interim distraction for certain DSCs, it must be treated with extreme caution. It is known to harbor an obsessive desire for things and has a particular fondness for grooming products.

Addendum:

Item #1002 was brought to the Foundation's attention when reports surfaced of it persuading passerby on New York streets to purchase its own unique designer pieces. Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 "Paisley Patterns" was sent in to contain the anomaly, where it was acquired and transferred to Site-██.
