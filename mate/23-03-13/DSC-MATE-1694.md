Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-1694 is to be monitored at all times by undercover agents within her political network. Any suspicious or anomalous activities must be immediately reported to the Foundation. All personnel are to maintain a cover story that presents DSC-MATE-1694 as a legitimate politician to the public. Any attempts to manipulate her or her network must be handled through covert methods to avoid drawing attention to the Foundation.

Description:
DSC-MATE-1694 appears to be a human female with distinctive spots on her face and red lipstick, often seen wearing a bucket hat and sporting a two color band on her forehead with a goggle on top. Despite her political career, DSC-MATE-1694 is known to have unusual hobbies and interests such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. Although DSC-MATE-1694 appears to be human, it is suspected that she may have anomalous properties that allow her to stave off aging and grant her extraordinary abilities in influencing others.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-1694 has shown a particular interest in the occult and is known to attend rituals involving anomalous entities. While there is no direct evidence linking her to any anomalous activities, her involvement in these rituals must be closely monitored. Additionally, her gold earring and gold chain may be connected to rituals as well and require further investigation.
