DSC Identification Number 2775, commonly known as "The Compassionate Villain," is a male robot with unique and distinctive features. His eyes resemble ski goggles, giving him an intimidating and otherworldly appearance. The head of this robot is crowned with a Doge hat, adding a touch of irony to his sinister nature. But it is the Jade Earring decorating his ears that truly sets him apart from other machines of his kind.

Despite being a notorious villain in the world of urban fantasy, DSC 2775 has a surprisingly gentle and empathetic personality. He possesses a deep and profound ability to connect with others, often feeling their pain as if it were his own. His compassion for others has led him to take on the problems of those around him, even if they do not concern him. This admirable quality, however, can sometimes be a double-edged sword. As he tries to fix the problems of others without consideration for his own well-being, he can become exhausted and overwhelmed.

If one encounters DSC 2775, it is best to approach him with caution. He may seem to have a good heart, but his villainous tendencies cannot be ignored. He has been known to use his compassion as a weapon, manipulating others into doing his bidding. His unique appearance and personality make him a formidable foe in the urban fantasy world.
