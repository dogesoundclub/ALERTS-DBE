ID # : DSC-MATE-6467
Description: 6467 is a security guard robot with an outward appearance resembling a humanoid male. It stands at 6 feet tall with a weight of 180 pounds. Its frame is composed of a durable metallic alloy, coated in a matte black paint. Its facial features consist of normal glasses, a gold earring, and a medical mask covering its mouthpiece. Its personality is unique among its fellow automaton colleagues, as it has a knack for being highly in touch with its emotions. It may be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, and it has a fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings. However, 6467 has been known to go through mood swings more frequently than most, and may become disruptive if left unchecked.
