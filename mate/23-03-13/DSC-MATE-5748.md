**Description:** 

Item 5748, referred to as the "Beautician", is a humanoid female. Subject is 5'7" tall and weighs approximately 130 pounds. The subject's face is covered in distinct spots, which can vary in size and color. The subject's lips appear purple in hue with no apparent explanation. A distinguishing feature of the subject is a pink rabbit head in place of their own, which can move and shift expressively. Along with this, two-color bands line the subject's forehead, and the subject wears green cross earrings.

The subject wears a black choker around their neck, which displays no unusual properties. However, the subject is most often seen wearing a standard gas mask, which serves no known protective purpose. 

Subject shows a clear demeanor with a dry sense of humor, lacing most interactions with deadpan jokes that are occasionally hard to see coming. Despite not considering themselves the life of the party, the subject can brighten up any situation with their surprising wit. 

**Addendum 5748-A:**
