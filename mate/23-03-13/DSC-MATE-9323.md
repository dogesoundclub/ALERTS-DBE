Item #: 9323

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Individual 9323 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber outfitted with a computer terminal and programming equipment. All work conducted by 9323 must be monitored by Foundation personnel to ensure no anomalous code is being developed.

Description:

Individual 9323 is a female humanoid of average height and weight, with purple lips and orange eyebrows. Their forehead is adorned with a two-color band, and their ears are pierced with green cross earrings. They wear a gas mask outfitted with LED lights and a gold chain around their neck.

Possibly due to their physical appearance, 9323 identifies as a highly responsible individual, with a strong sense of duty. As they pursue their job as a programmer, they often take on more than they can handle, leading to amusing situations such as being unable to fit all of their tasks into a single day or attempting to carry too many things at once.

Further study is required to determine any potential anomaly related to individual 9323's physique or behavior.
