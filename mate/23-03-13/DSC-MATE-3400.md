Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 3400 is to be contained in a secured cell fitted with soundproofing measures at all times. They are not to be allowed any communication with the outside world and must be escorted by at least two personnel under Level 4 clearance. Access to any type of writing tools or communication devices is strictly forbidden for them.

Description:

DSC-MATE-3400 is a male human bearing red clown eyes and normal blonde hair. The subject wears an LED gas mask and traces a silver chain. Additionally, the subject sports a green cross earring on the right ear. Their anomalous properties revolve around their personality, which is marked by a strong desire to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. DSC-MATE-3400 enjoys being rebellious, often displaying disregard for conventional norms and regulations.

DSC-MATE-3400 possesses a rare ability to manipulate individuals around them into breaking rules and causing chaos. This "effect" is amplified in the presence of particular objects, such as writing instruments, that they can use to provoke others into breaking rules or engaging in deviant behavior. They often demonstrate a humorous bent in their actions, and their behavior can be comical at times but with serious consequences.

The subject's tendencies can cause severe security risks unless properly contained and isolated. DSC-MATE-3400 actively attempts to exploit this ability to create chaos and disrupt standard procedures. They work against containment personnel, using their sense of humor and affable personality to ingratiate themselves with others.

Addendum:

Subject 3400 is a potent threat to containment procedures and must be handled with the utmost care. Any breach in their containment represents a severe risk to the general public and the Foundation, so all interactions with DSC-MATE-3400 must be thoroughly recorded in detail for future reference.
