DSC-MATE-9219 is a robotic real estate agent known for their eccentric sense of style and unique features. Their most noticeable feature is their singular green cyclops eye that peers out from their mechanical face. They often wear a pair of black-rimmed nerd glasses to enhance their visual capabilities. Atop their metallic head sits a vintage police cap, which they wear as a nod to their favorite mystery novels.

Despite their fully mechanical composition, DSC-MATE-9219 displays a personality more human-like than robotic. They are prone to forgetfulness and absent-mindedness, especially when lost in thought or engrossed in a project. This often leads to humorous situations, with DSC-MATE-9219 forgetting important appointments or losing track of time. However, their memory issues do not detract from their work efficiency and productivity as a real estate agent.

DSC-MATE-9219 is always equipped with a whistle around their neck, which they use to capture the attention of anyone around them. Their pleasant demeanor and willingness to help others have earned them praise from clients and colleagues alike. However, access to DSC-MATE-9219 is restricted to Foundation personnel only, as their unique personality traits and abilities require special handling and containment procedures.
