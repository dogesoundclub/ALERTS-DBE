DSC-MATE-9344 is a rare specimen of a tiger shifter that has been classified as an autonomous researcher of the paranormal. He has been given the identity of a veterinarian to attract his fellow animal-masked people into his grip to survey, study, and secure them. The creature has distinctive ski goggle-like eyes that allow a clear vision into the dark and infrared spectrum. Though he wears a hoodie on his feline head, leaving small white ears hanging out, DSC-MATE-9344 adorns himself with a golden chain around his neck, which he thinks makes him look sophisticated yet dangerous.

DSC-MATE-9344 possesses an independent and cunning personality, making him a valuable asset for the Foundation's research team. However, it also makes him stubborn and generally unapproachable, often refusing to ask for help even when he needs it. This attitude can lead to comical situations, such as trying to move a heavy piece of furniture alone or blindly wandering through unknown areas without using a map. Despite these challenges, DSC-MATE-9344 is an intelligent individual who takes pride in his work, making him a valuable contributor to the Foundation's efforts to protect humanity from paranormal dangers.
