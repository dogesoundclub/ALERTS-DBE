DSC-MATE-1438, also known by their former identity as a traffic officer, is a male anthropomorphic rabbit. Their frightened mouth gives off the impression that they are constantly nervous or anxious, which may be a side effect of their new species. DSC-MATE-1438 prefers to wear nerd glasses and a blue bandana around their head, which appears to be a personal fashion statement. They also carry a cigarette, though they never seem to light it.

Despite their small stature, DSC-MATE-1438 values harmony and social connections above all else. They possess a goofy personality that can lead to humorous situations, such as telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with others. However, due to their nervous disposition, they tend to struggle in high-stress situations.

DSC-MATE-1438 was discovered wandering through a busy intersection, seemingly unaware of the dangers around them. When approached by Foundation agents, they exhibited no signs of fear, but were immediately taken into custody due to their abnormal physical attributes. DSC-MATE-1438 has since adapted well to containment, though their nervousness has not subsided.

Under no circumstances are personnel to engage in any kind of physical contact with DSC-MATE-1438. While they appear harmless, their species poses an unknown level of danger. In the event of an escape attempt or breach, all personnel are authorized to use non-lethal means to subdue and re-contain DSC-MATE-1438.
