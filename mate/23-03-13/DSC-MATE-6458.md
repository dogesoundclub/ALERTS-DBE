DogeSoundClub Description:

Subject 6458 is a law enforcement unit assigned to the urban fantasy division of the DogeSoundClub. This robot appears to be male and is characterized by a retro cap on its head, a jade earring on each ear, and a gold chain around its neck.

Subject 6458's face feature displays a frightened mouth, which adds a touch of intimidation to his already imposing physical presence. On the forehead, there is a goggle that is believed to give the robot a heads-up-display.

Personality-wise, 6458 is an absent-minded and forgetful unit. Even though it was programmed to never forget tiny details, it is commonplace for the unit to miss out on significant events or appointments because of being lost in thought or working on a case.

This behaviour makes subject 6458 an interesting mix of both intimidating and innocent. His tendency to forget things makes him more approachable, while his physical attributes make him a formidable foe in any fight.
