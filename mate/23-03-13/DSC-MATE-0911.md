Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-911 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███.

DSC-MATE-911 must be provided with a medical mask at all times to prevent accidental activation of her anomalous properties.

Description:
DSC-MATE-911 is a humanoid entity of the female sex, standing at approximately 1.6 meters in height. The subject possesses two distinct spots on her face, one above each cheekbone. Her mouth is obscured by a medical mask, and she wears pigtail hair extensions. DSC-MATE-911's eyes are a jade green color and contain a light-emitting diode (LED) display, which gives them a virtual reality appearance. Two jade earrings are also present in the subject's ears, and a silver chain is often worn around her neck.

DSC-MATE-911 displays a spontaneous and restless personality, often engaging in risky and reckless behavior. These risky behaviors have included jumping off cliffs into bodies of water on a whim, as well as other impulsive acts. DSC-MATE-911 has demonstrated an awareness of her anomalous properties, and as such, the subject must be carefully monitored at all times.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-911's career as a banker has been deemed to be a cover story. Further investigation is underway to determine the true nature of her employment.
