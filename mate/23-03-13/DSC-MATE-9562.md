Subject #9562, also known as "The Clown Doctor," is a human male with a striking appearance. He bears numerous spots all over his face, giving him an almost cheery, carnival-like appearance. Perhaps the most notable aspect of his face are his bright, red clown eyes - they are unnaturally vibrant and seem to shimmer with a manic energy. His smile is equally disturbing - thin and razor sharp, it seems to be permanently etched onto his face.

The Clown Doctor is rarely seen without his medical mask, which covers his mouth and obscures any potential expression. His ears bear a single gold earring, which glints in the light. Around his neck, he wears a long silver chain that seems to almost snake around his neck like a living thing.

Despite his unsettling appearance, The Clown Doctor is a logical and analytical thinker. He enjoys debating and arguing with others, and has a particular talent for taking even the most trivial topic and turning it into a heated, all-consuming argument. Others often find themselves laughing in disbelief as The Clown Doctor dives headfirst into debates that seem completely pointless - and yet, he always manages to win them. Perhaps it's his razor-sharp wit, or maybe it's his almost otherworldly sense of logic.

Whatever the reason, The Clown Doctor is not to be underestimated. Though he may seem like little more than a quirky doctor, his mind is sharp and his wit is deadly. Perhaps that's why he's often called upon to handle the weirdest, strangest cases that come through the hospital doors - for when it comes to the bizarre and inexplicable, The Clown Doctor is the only one who can truly unravel the mysteries.
