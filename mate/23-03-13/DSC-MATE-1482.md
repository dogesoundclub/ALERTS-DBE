DSC-MATE-1482, codenamed "The Lawyer", is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face and bright purple lips. Her head is often styled in two pig tails, accentuated by a black choker around her neck.

Nevertheless, her strategic planning and innate organizational skills inevitably allow her to overcome any obstacles in her path.

There is an almost palpable energy emanating from her aura. Her mere presence can cause those around her to feel more driven and inspired. DSC-MATE-1482's zealousness, while admirable, should be monitored for any possible repercussions that may arise from her all-encompassing drive towards success.
