DSC-MATE-1895, commonly referred to as "Officer Winged Choker", is a human traffic officer of undisclosed origin. She possesses several notable physical features, including a scattering of spots across her face, which has been observed to change in pattern and placement over time. Her eyes, obscured by a pair of normal glasses, are rumored to possess certain anomalous qualities, though no observable effects have been documented. 

Perhaps her most striking feature is the presence of a single white feather, protruding from the back of her head. The exact nature and function of this feather are currently unknown, but its existence has led to widespread speculation among Foundation personnel. Additionally, DSC-MATE-1895 is often seen wearing a red cross earring on her left ear, and a medical mask covering her mouth, which she claims is to protect her from airborne agents.

Possibly due to her ambitious and goal-oriented nature, DSC-MATE-1895 has taken on several high-profile cases during her time as a traffic officer, some of which have required her to utilize her strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills to a great extent. While some operatives have expressed concern that she may be taking on more than she can handle, she has managed to pull through each time with remarkable efficacy.

DSC-MATE-1895's motivations and ultimate goals remain unclear, but she has shown herself to be a valuable asset to the Foundation thus far, and is considered a low-level threat. As with all anomalous personnel, observations and caution are advised.
