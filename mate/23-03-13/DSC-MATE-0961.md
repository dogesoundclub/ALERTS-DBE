Item #: DSC-MATE-961

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-961 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any instances of DSC-MATE-961-1 are to be immediately neutralized and disposed of to prevent any potential contamination. Additionally, all personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-961 are required to wear level 4 hazmat suits at all times when interacting with DSC-MATE-961.

Description:

DSC-MATE-961 appears to be a male human with spots across his face and a wide smile. However, DSC-MATE-961's most notable feature is its red clown eyes. DSC-MATE-961 is often seen wearing a gold chain and a pair of goggles on its forehead.

DSC-MATE-961's personality is described as extremely creative with a vivid imagination. It has a variety of unusual hobbies, such as writing poetry, creating cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. However, these hobbies often involve harmful or dangerous materials, leading to possible contamination.

While DSC-MATE-961 has no apparent anomalous abilities, it has been linked to the creation and control of DSC-MATE-961-1, a type of parasitic entity that seems to vary in appearance and abilities. DSC-MATE-961-1 instances have been observed to emerge from DSC-MATE-961's body at seemingly random intervals and have been known to attack and infect nearby individuals. Due to the unpredictable nature of the DSC-MATE-961-1 instances, DSC-MATE-961 is considered to be a potential threat to Foundation personnel and must be contained at all times.

DSC-MATE-961 was originally discovered working as a fast-food worker at the local restaurant. Due to the reported unusual behavior and potential danger, Foundation agents were dispatched to locate and contain DSC-MATE-961. After containment, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-961 had inadvertently created and released DSC-MATE-961-1 instances throughout the restaurant, leading to significant contamination and resulting in the closure of the establishment.

Dr. ███████: Your DSC-MATE-961-1 instances have been known to attack and infect nearby individuals. Why is this?

DSC-MATE-961: (laughs) Well, they're not really supposed to do that. But sometimes, they get a little mischievous and like to play around. That's all.

Dr. ███████: I see. Well, we'll have to work on containing and neutralizing any instances that emerge from you in the future.

DSC-MATE-961: Aw, that's no fun. But I understand. The world isn't quite ready for my little pets yet.
