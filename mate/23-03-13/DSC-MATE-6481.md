Description:

6481, also known as "The Vet," is a human female with unusual physical features. The subject has blue clown eyes and purple lips, which contrast starkly with her platinum blonde hair. The skin of the subject's head is partially covered in feathers, resembling a bird's wing. The subject also wears a red cross earring and a choker.

The Vet works as a veterinarian and prefers to fix things in unconventional manners, often relying on simple tools such as duct tape and paper clips to fix broken objects. The subject also has a habit of rigging makeshift solutions to complex problems. This practicality, while useful, has led to some dangerous situations, particularly when handling delicate equipment or animals.

The subject's personality can be unpredictable and at times challenging, as they are incredibly hands-on and can become quite impatient when others fail to keep up. However, her practical skills and ingenuity make her an asset in difficult situations.

It is still unknown how the Vet obtained her unusual physical features, and further research is needed to understand the subject's full capabilities.
