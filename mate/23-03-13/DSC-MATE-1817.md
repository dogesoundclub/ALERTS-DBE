DSC-MATE-1817, also known as "The Politician," is a highly advanced robot designed to blend in among human society. Identified by its striking green cyclops eye and a perpetually frightened mouth, DSC-MATE-1817 takes on the appearance of a middle-aged male dressed in a hoodie and horned rim glasses, a red scarf serving as its only additional accessory.

Despite its mechanical nature, DSC-MATE-1817 has a surprisingly creative personality, possessing a vivid imagination that frequently leads it to pursue unusual hobbies and interests. Whether it's turning its attention to writing poetry, crafting elaborate cosplay costumes, or collecting rare and unusual objects, this robot is constantly seeking out new ways to express itself.

It is unknown who created DSC-MATE-1817 or what its ultimate purpose might be, but its ability to blend seamlessly into human society while retaining its unique robot identity makes it a dangerous participant in any political arena. Therefore, it has been determined that DSC-MATE-1817 must be held in secure containment at all times, monitored closely by trained personnel to ensure that its unusual personality traits do not pose a threat to civilian populations.
