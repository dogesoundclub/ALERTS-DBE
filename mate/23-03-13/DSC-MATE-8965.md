Subject 8965, also known as "The Spotter," is a human male who has made a name for himself as a notorious villain in the urban fantasy community. He is easily identifiable by the spots on his face and his perpetually frightened mouth, which is always open in a silent scream.

The most striking feature of Subject 8965 is his eyes, which are fitted with VR Rainbow LED technology. Their colorful glow makes it seem as if he is constantly staring into the abyss. He wears a purple cap with a headset attached to it, which allows him to communicate with other members of his gang.

Subject 8965 also sports a green cross earring in his left ear, which some believe to be a symbol of his allegiance to a dangerous faction of necromancers. He is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck and carrying a candy stick, which he uses as a makeshift weapon when necessary.

Despite his fearsome appearance, Subject 8965 can be a bit scatterbrained and forgetful. He has been known to get sidetracked during important missions or forget crucial information, which has led to some comedic moments. However, his unpredictability and dangerous nature make him an asset to any villainous organization, which is why he remains at large and a constant threat to the public.
