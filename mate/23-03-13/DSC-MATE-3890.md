DSC-MATE-3890 is easily identifiable by its frightened mouth, causing an unnerving appearance that can lead to fear or sympathy from observers. DSC-MATE-3890's eyes remain unknown due to its constant use of a headset with LED display that covers them.

DSC-MATE-3890 also appears to have an inclination towards music and art that evoke strong feelings.

DSC-MATE-3890's true nature and origins remain unknown, as it has recently taken on the profession of a reporter, a standard cover among DSCs working within society. DSC-MATE-3890's work as a reporter has led to various leads and observations on other DSCs, though its unusual tendencies require monitoring during missions. Due to DSC-MATE-3890's unusual sensitivity and emotional response, interactions with it should be kept to a minimum and monitored closely to reduce any potential risks.
