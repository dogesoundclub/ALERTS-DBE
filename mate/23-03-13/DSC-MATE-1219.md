Description:
DSC-MATE-1219 is a male tiger of indeterminate breed, with an unusual facial feature resembling that of a human's frightened mouth. It has been noted that DSC-MATE-1219 has a tendency to wear normal glasses despite having excellent vision. DSC-MATE-1219's head is adorned with green hair, often seen under a purple cap, and it wears a silver chain as an accessory. It is also frequently seen with a cigarette in its jaws.

DSC-MATE-1219's most notable trait is its introspectiveness, often lost in thought or lost in daydreams. This tendency has led to some comical mishaps, such as bumping into walls or tripping over its own feet. Despite these flaws, DSC-MATE-1219 is an excellent doctor, with a deep understanding of medicine and its applications.

DSC-MATE-1219's unique physiology allows it to possess extraordinary medical skills, ten times more efficient than any human doctor. Its ability to diagnose illnesses and internal malfunctions are impeccable, and its treatments have a 100% success rate.

DSC-MATE-1219 is fully aware of its anomalous nature, but has remained cooperative with Foundation personnel, choosing to work with them willingly. However, during periods of intense introspection or stress, it has shown unpredictable behavior, becoming agitated and dangerous, requiring immediate sedation.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-1219 is considered an important asset to the Foundation, and its cooperation is highly valued. Special care is to be taken when handling DSC-MATE-1219, as its skills could be highly sought after by other groups or organizations. Any breaches of its containment should be dealt with according to standard protocol.
