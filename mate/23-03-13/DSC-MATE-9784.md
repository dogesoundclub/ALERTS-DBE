DSC-MATE-9784's eyes are covered by normal glasses, and its head is a bright red alarm with a goggled forehead. Its ears are adorned with red cross earrings, and it wears a red scarf and an LED gas mask as accessories. 

While DSC-MATE-9784's appearance may be intimidating at first, it possesses a charming personality that can put anyone at ease. It takes its job as a car salesman very seriously and has a strong sense of duty and responsibility.
