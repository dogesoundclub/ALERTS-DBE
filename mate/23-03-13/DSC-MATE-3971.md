DSC-MATE-3971, also known as the "Jester Monk", is a male human beautician with a unique appearance. The subject has spots on their face and a permanent smile that stretches from ear to ear, revealing their blue clown eyes. DSC-MATE-3971 also wears a medical mask over their mouth, presumably to hide any facial expressions that might detract from their overall appearance.

The subject's head is shaven in a monk-like fashion, and they wear a jade earring in each ear. DSC-MATE-3971's attention to detail extends beyond their appearance since they possess a keen observation skill that makes them an excellent gift-giver with their unique sense of humor. However, this trait also makes them prone to agonizing over what gift to give, as they strive for perfection.

The Foundation is currently exploring the potential benefits of DSC-MATE-3971's gift-giving ability for covert operations. The subject's quirky personality would make them a valuable asset in gaining the trust of individuals with a particular interest in the unusual or macabre. However, special care must be taken to ensure that the subject is not over-tasked, leading to potential burnout. DSC-MATE-3971's personality also necessitates close monitoring for any signs of stress, anxiety, or obsessive tendencies that may cause the subject to break protocol or suffer a mental breakdown.
