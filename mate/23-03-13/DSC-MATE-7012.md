Subject 7012, also known as the "Tiger Driver," is a delivery driver employed by an undisclosed company. While his job may seem mundane, make no mistake: 7012 is not your average feline.

This tiger stands out with his distinct red cross earring and bold red scarf. But it's not just his accessories that make him memorable.

Don't let his charming appearance fool you, though - this tiger is no pushover. With a quick mind and a talent for debate, 7012 enjoys sparring with others over the tiniest of details. However, it's not all just for fun - his analytical and logical nature can come in handy for solving problems on the job.

It's not entirely clear how 7012 came into his current position, or how he chooses to use his unique talents. One thing's for sure, though - you won't forget the Tiger Driver once he's crossed your path.
