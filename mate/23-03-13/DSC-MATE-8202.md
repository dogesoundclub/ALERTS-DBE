DSC-MATE-8202, also known as "The Clown", is a female human who currently serves as a security guard in our facility. Her unusual appearance draws attention as she is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset and a pair of jade earrings. But what truly stands out are her red clown eyes, which seem to unsettle those who are not accustomed to them.

Despite her intimidating appearance, DSC-MATE-8202's personality is rather rational and logical. She enjoys challenging others to debates and can be quite vocal about her beliefs, often engaging in heated discussions with anyone who crosses her path. However, this behavior has led to several humorous situations where she has argued passionately about trivial or insignificant topics.

DSC-MATE-8202's analytical mind makes her an asset to our team, and her dedication to her job should not be underestimated. However, it is advised that personnel should approach her with caution and refrain from engaging in debates or arguments, as her arguments can be quite persuasive and may lead to unintended consequences. Additionally, DSC-MATE-8202 carries a cigarette with her at all times, although smoking within the facility is strictly prohibited.
