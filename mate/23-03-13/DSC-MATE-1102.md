DSC-MATE-1102, also known as "The Mechanic," is a male monkey of unknown origin. The subject stands at approximately 3 feet tall and weighs around 90 pounds, making him larger than a typical primate of his species. DSC-MATE-1102 sports a retro cap with a goggle on his forehead, and his eyes are covered by ski goggles. The subject has a noticeable gold earring on both ears and wears a gold chain around his neck. 

However, the most distinguishing feature of DSC-MATE-1102 is his accessorial LED gas mask that is always in place when working in his mechanical laboratory. DSC-MATE-1102's gas mask has been retrofitted with several unique modifications and additions that have yet to be fully explored. 

DSC-MATE-1102's personality could be described as highly analytical and logical, preferring to spend most of his time tinkering with machines in his lab. He possesses an encyclopedic level of knowledge about mechanical engineering and has utilized all his know-how to create unique and highly efficient machines. 

Despite his serious nature, DSC-MATE-1102 tends to have a quirky sense of humor that involves witty observations and teasing his friends in a dry, deadpan way. DSC-MATE-1102 has a brain that works similar to a supercomputer, solving problems quickly and efficiently. 

DSC-MATE-1102 has been classified as safe, but warning, the subject might not respond well to outside stimuli. Thus, should be observed and maintained precisely because we do not want to raise any potential hazards arising from the subject's experiments.
