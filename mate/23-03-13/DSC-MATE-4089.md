His parted pink hair is styled and combed to the right. On his forehead, he wears a translucent goggle with magnification lenses that is used in accident sites to evaluate evidence clearly. Agent 4089 has a pair of green cross-shaped earrings, which he claims provide him with luck and good fortune. He is often seen wearing a red scarf, which he says reminds him of his beloved grandmother.
