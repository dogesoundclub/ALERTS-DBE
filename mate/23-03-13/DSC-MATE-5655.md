ITEM #: 5655

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: 5655 is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times. The subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with additional features to accommodate his tiger morphology. Access to 5655's containment chamber requires level 3 clearance and approval from at least two supervising researchers. As a safety precaution, all interaction with the subject must be conducted via remote means.

DESCRIPTION: 5655 is a male Bengal tiger with a height of 6 feet and a weight of 500 pounds. The subject wears a police cap on its head and a silver chain around his neck. A jade earring is pierced on each ear. 5655's most peculiar feature is its eyes, which are made of virtual reality jade LED. One unique attribute is that 5655 has a frightened mouth that seems to be perpetually open in a terrified expression.

PERSONALITY: Upon Foundation personnel's initial interactions with 5655, the subject seemed hesitant to engage. However, over time it became apparent that the subject is playful and enjoys taking risks. 5655 is very spontaneous and can often be seen doing things on a whim, leading to some humorous situations, such as impulsively leaping off high places into water. The subject has a keen sense of fun and play.

JOB: 5655 is a licensed Real Estate Agent. Details on how the subject obtained this are unknown.

ADDENDUM: Due to 5655's nature, regular psychological evaluations and testing are required to ensure that the subject's personality and behavior remain consistent. 5655's area of work is currently limited to Foundation property, and all inquiries from the outside world are to be screened by Foundation personnel.
