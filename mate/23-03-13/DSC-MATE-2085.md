Subject 2085, also known as "The Rabbit," is a humanoid creature with the physical appearance of an anthropomorphic bunny. Despite its cute and innocent exterior, caution should be exercised when interacting with this DSC; its intelligence and resourcefulness are beyond what one might expect from a mere animal.

As a security guard, 2085 is a highly skilled protector for any facility or situation. Its sharp observation and analytical thinking give it a vigilant edge over any potential threats. It is also known to showcase a dry and quirky sense of humor that it uses to lighten the mood in tense situations.

One distinctive feature of this DSC is its VR Rainbow LED eyes that serve as an additional defensive mechanism; they can be used to disorient or distract enemies, giving 2085 an upper hand in any combat situation. Additionally, the not arranged green head and the Jade earring adorning its ears give it a unique and recognizable appearance.

Despite its seemingly aloof personality, 2085 is fiercely loyal to friends and allies. Do not underestimate The Rabbit's judgement, senses, or quick thinking when in danger. The Rabbit makes for an efficient and essential member of any team or organization.
