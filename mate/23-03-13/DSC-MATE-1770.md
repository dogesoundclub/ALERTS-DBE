Subject 1770, also known as "The Monkey in the Doge Hat," is a peculiar species of simian with a penchant for fast food and organization. With his iconic Doge hat perched upon his head and a pair of ski goggle eyes to protect against frying oil, 1770 can often be found dutifully working the counter at his place of employment.

Despite his diminutive size and unassuming appearance, 1770 possesses an uncanny talent for managing projects and delegating tasks. Some might even say he has a gift for organization, although this has been known to border on the obsessive at times.

In addition to his signature accessories, 1770 is never without his trusty red scarf and a lit cigarette. These serve as both fashion statements and personal trademarks, further adding to the enigmatic nature of this unusual primate.

Although some may find his controlling tendencies a bit off-putting, those who know 1770 best understand that his strong sense of leadership and organization are simply part of who he is. And even when things get a bit chaotic, as they often do in the fast-paced world of fast food, you can always count on the Monkey in the Doge Hat to keep things running smoothly.
