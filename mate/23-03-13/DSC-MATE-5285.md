Item #: 5285

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Item #5285 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber should have a law library and ample reading materials. The room must also be equipped with a noise-cancelling system to prevent the subject from distracting others with their whistling.

Description:
Item #5285 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 3 feet tall. The subject is often seen wearing a retro cap and goggles on their forehead. They carry a whistle on their person at all times.

Personality:
Item #5285 is highly intelligent and perpetually thirsty for knowledge. They show great enthusiasm for education and will often spend hours lost in reading or researching obscure topics. The subject is known to collect books and other educational materials, showing a great passion for sharing knowledge with others. They can be quite the chatterbox when excited about a topic.

In incident #5285-1, the subject breached containment and spent the night stealing knowledge from various documents in the site's library before returning to their containment chamber without causing further disturbance.

It is advised that personnel interact with the subject in small doses to avoid being overwhelmed and distracted by their constant desire for learning.

Addendum:
Further research into Item #5285's background revealed that they were once a human lawyer named Harold Hopper, who, due to a freak accident involving magical energies, was transformed into a rabbit. Item #5285 has since been working to uncover a way to reverse the transformation and regain their human form.
