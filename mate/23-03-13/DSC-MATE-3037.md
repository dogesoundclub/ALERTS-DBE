DSC-MATE-3037, also known as "The Striped Veterinarian," is a human male with orange tiger stripes adorning his face. Despite his unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-3037 exudes an air of confidence and cheerfulness, always wearing a smile that seems to put those around him at ease. His two red clown eyes, while startling at first, often serve to enhance his friendly demeanor.

It has been reported that DSC-MATE-3037 has occasionally been seen wearing a green cross earring in one ear, and a thick gold chain around his neck. While these items do not appear to have any anomalous properties, they may be symbolic or meaningful to DSC-MATE-3037 in some way.

DSC-MATE-3037 is a veterinarian by profession, and has demonstrated exceptional skill in the care and treatment of animals. However, he is also known for being somewhat absent-minded and forgetful, frequently losing track of time and forgetting appointments. Despite this, he remains highly motivated and dedicated to his work, often getting lost in thought while tending to his furry patients.

DSC-MATE-3037's forgetfulness can sometimes lead to humorous situations, but it is generally not considered to be a problem within the Foundation. He has proven to be a valuable asset to our team, and his passion and compassion for animals is unrivaled.

As always, any strange or unusual behavior from DSC-MATE-3037 should be reported to the nearest containment specialist immediately.
