Description:
DSC-MATE-9572 is a female human of approximately 30 years of age, measuring 175 centimeters in height and weighing 75 kilograms. They possess distinctly unique physical traits, including orange stripes on their cheeks and forehead, and vibrant VR rainbow LED eyes.

DSC-MATE-9572 is known for their laid-back and easy-going personality but is fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones. Provoking DSC-MATE-9572's protective nature can lead to humorous yet potentially dangerous situations, including verbal altercations and physical confrontations.

DSC-MATE-9572 is cooperative and compliant with Foundation personnel, but their anomalous traits and lack of identification make it difficult to ascertain their true nature and purpose. Further investigation into DSC-MATE-9572's abilities and origins is ongoing.
