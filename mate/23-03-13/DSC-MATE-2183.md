DSC-MATE-2183 is a male tiger in the form of a humanoid banker, with striking red clown eyes and a frightened-looking mouth. He is often seen sporting a police cap, accessorized with a jade earring and a red scarf. 
Despite his fearsome appearance, 2183 has a penchant for organizing and controlling situations. This supervising tendency, while amusing in its matter-of-fact approach to delegating tasks, can occasionally come across as controlling to those who come into contact with him. 
Despite this, 2183 carries out all of his work with tireless efficiency, making him one of the most reliable and productive employees to have on your side. We recommend taking caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-2183, but his impressive work ethic makes him a valuable asset to the urban fantasy universe.
