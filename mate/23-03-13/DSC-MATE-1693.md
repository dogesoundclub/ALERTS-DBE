Item #: 1693

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1693, also known as the "News Anchor," is to be contained in a secure zoological facility. The enclosure must be well-lit, well-ventilated, and spacious enough to provide Subject 1693 with ample room to roam. Caretakers must be outfitted with full-body suits and gas masks to prevent any potential harm.

Subject 1693's diet should include a healthy balance of meat and vegetation, as well as enrichment activities such as puzzles and toys. Contact with Subject 1693 is to be limited to trained personnel only, and visitors must have a full security escort.

Description:

Subject 1693 appears as a male tiger with an unremarkable pair of eyes. It often wears a blue bandana and a medical mask, which it seems to prefer. It has a gold earring on one of its ears, and a gold chain as an accessory. Interestingly, they have a creative and artistic side that they may express through various hobbies or interests such as painting, drawing, or other forms of artistic expression.

Personality:

Subject 1693 has shown itself to be an intelligent and curious individual. They are also quite artistic, with impressive creative abilities. Subject 1693 values its privacy and is generally suspicious of new people. It can become aggressive if it believes that it or its enclosure is under threat, even from harmless interactions.

Subject 1693 has occasionally displayed an intense dislike of its own species and seems to prefer human company. When allowed to engage in artistic pursuits, however, it appears to be more relaxed and less territorial. Its creative side has the potential for positive outcomes, but must be closely monitored to prevent any negative effects.

Addendum 1693-A:

Following a breach incident in which Subject 1693 escaped, procedures for its containment have been re-evaluated. It is recommended that personnel use caution when entering Subject 1693's enclosure, even when wearing protective suits. Any changes in Subject 1693's behavior should be reported immediately to senior staff.
