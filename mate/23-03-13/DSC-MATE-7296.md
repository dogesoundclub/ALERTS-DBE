ITEM #: 7296

OBJECT CLASS: Safe

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

DSC-MATE-7296 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Because of DSC-MATE-7296's cooperative nature, in addition to her mundane profession as a fashion designer, there is currently no need for any further containment measures, except restricting the access to sharp objects or tools.

DESCRIPTION:

DSC-MATE-7296 is a female human with orange stripes on her face as the predominant facial feature. DSC-MATE-7296's mouth is covered in a medical mask, which covers a bright red lip, and orange and green rabbit ears, connected by a golden chain that encircles her neck. DSC-MATE-7296 has normal glasses over her eyes, but the lenses have been replaced with sedative compound to prevent her from causing any damage.

DSC-MATE-7296 has a stubborn personality and a strong sense of independence which can make her reluctant to ask for help, even when it is required. DSC-MATE-7296's persistence in achieving her goals has resulted in her refusal to use maps or navigational devices despite her consistently getting lost.

ADDENDUM:

DSC-MATE-7296 was discovered through an intercepted internal memo from a known anomalous fashion brand. The memo detailed the production of fashion accessories that are capable of enchanting humans to do their bidding in exchange for empowering their fashion sense. DSC-MATE-7296 was believed to be a volunteer or was remunerated with other anomalous fashion accessories. Further investigation on DSC-MATE-7296's acquaintance with the anomalous fashion designer or its manufacturing process is being conducted by the research team assigned to DSC-MATE-7296.
