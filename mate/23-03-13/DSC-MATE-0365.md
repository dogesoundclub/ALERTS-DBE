Item #: 365

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 365 is to be held in a standard urban fantasy Safehouse, equipped with basic amenities for human care. Personnel assigned to Subject 365 are to require thorough background checks, and no contact with any other entities or groups related to DSC foundation. Communication with Subject 365 must not be in the form of text or audiovisual data, and conducted only through physical and non-digital means.

Description:

Subject 365 is a Human Male, identified as a Doctor by profession. The subject bears the unique facial feature of orange stripes, running across his hairline and forehead. Their mouth is always slightly agape in a frightened expression, signifying a history of exposure to dangerous situations.

The subject wears normal glasses, and has a head of blonde hair, commonly associated with humans in many cultures. Their forehead bears a two-color band of undetermined material. The subject has a green cross earring worn on the right ear.

Subject 365 is always seen carrying a candy stick, which they tend to unconsciously lick or chew on while thinking. It has not exhibited any anomalous properties thus far. Other accessories worn by the subject may be fitted only with the approval of Foundation personnel.

Subject 365 has a love for adventure and may enjoy taking risks or trying new things. Their curiosity and adventurous nature are a potential security risk, but- is still ultimately harmless. The subject's past experiences are occasionally reported in humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

Personnel who interact with Subject 365 have reported that they are generally cooperative and welcoming, showing no significant personality or behavioral concerns. It is to be noted that any attempt to interfere with or manipulate Subject 365's desire for adventure may result in unintended consequences. 

Addendum:

As of the time of this writing, there is no evidence or suspicion that Subject 365 is affiliated with any anomalous object or phenomenon in the Foundation's custody or known to the public. Their significance to the DogeSoundClub is, therefore, under careful monitoring for future developments or potential resource allotment.
