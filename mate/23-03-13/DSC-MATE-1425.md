ITEM #: DSC-MATE-1425

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: DSC-MATE-1425 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The cell must be outfitted with safety padding and additional lighting due to DSC-MATE-1425's tendency to be lost in thought. DSC-MATE-1425 is to be provided with a woolen sweater for comfort, as rabbit fur has a calming effect on him.

DSC-MATE-1425 is to undergo regular psychological evaluations with an approved therapist to ensure he does not pose a threat to himself or others. Any signs of aggression must be reported immediately to the security team.

DESCRIPTION: DSC-MATE-1425 resembles a male rabbit with ski goggle eyes and a hoodie on his head, which he refuses to remove. DSC-MATE-1425 is known to be very introspective and often spends hours lost in thought, oblivious to his surroundings. As a result, he has a tendency to walk into objects, trip over things, and bump into other people.

DSC-MATE-1425 has the ability to speak fluent English and has been known to use his introspection to his advantage in his political career, often taking a step back from heated debates to consider his arguments carefully.

ADDENDUM: DSC-MATE-1425 has requested a pet rabbit to keep him company in his cell. After careful consideration, it has been approved, and DSC-MATE-1425 has been provided with a male Holland Lop named Thumper. DSC-MATE-1425 has shown a remarkable improvement in his overall well-being since the introduction of his pet.
