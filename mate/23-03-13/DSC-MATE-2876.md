Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2876 is to be kept in a secure containment area, lined with high-strength steel and monitored 24/7 by trained personnel.

Description:

Subject 2876 is a male monkey, primarily purple in color, with gold fur on the face and hands. Its most noticeable feature is a blue bandana wrapped around its head, covering its ears, and an unusual Jade earring. A gold chain is also observed on the neck.

It wears a gas mask at all times and a pair of goggles around its forehead.

The subject's physical appearance is not anomalous, but its personality traits make it a unique member of its species. It is highly practical, using unconventional methods to fix any broken object, sometimes with the aid of duct tape or paper clips.

Subject 2876 works as a train driver, operating and repairing train systems, which it does with remarkable expertise, even taking measures beyond standard procedures. The gas mask and goggles may indicate fear of dangerous chemicals, viruses or bacteria in or outside its working environment, hence the necessary protection from them.

Subject 2876 is able to communicate through Sign language, having been trained in it by Foundation personnel. Nonetheless, the use of the sign language is not limited to communication as it also serve as a means of entertainment for the subject.

The Foundation acquired the subject in , having been involved in one or two rare incidents where the subject had displayed heightened physical abilities. Investigations are ongoing to determine if any genetic enhancements or enhancements of any kind have been performed on the creature.

Addendum 2876-1: As of 05/02/19, Subject 2876 work hours have been extended due to its unforeseen ability to detect, locate and disable anomalous incidents and or phenomena in train tracks or systems during its operation. Such incidents have led to the discovery of DSC-████, DSC-████ and DSC-████, which had gone unnoticed in the past.

It is recommended that Subject 2876 is closely monitored and documented, as its ability to detect anomalous entities or phenomenon could prove useful in containing future incidents that may have gone unnoticed.
