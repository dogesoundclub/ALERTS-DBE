ID # : DSC-MATE-5700
Description: Subject 5700 is a humanoid entity of the species Homo sapiens with several distinctive physical features. The subject possesses a number of spots on their face, which may be attributed to a genetic quirk or an as-yet-unidentified anomalous effect. Additionally, their mouth is often contorted in a frightened expression, as if they are perpetually on the verge of tears or terror. The subject's eyes are obscured by normal-looking glasses, which may be concealing any potential abilities or traits, but at this time, have not been shown to be anomalous.
