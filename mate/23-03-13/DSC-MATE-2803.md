Item #: 2803

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2803, referred to as the "Rabbit Designer," is to be treated as a sentient entity and must be provided with adequate living conditions. Any attempts to harm, contain, or control 2803 are strictly forbidden.

Description:

2803 is a male rabbit that has taken on the profession of a fashion designer. The subject wears a retro cap on its head, with a gold earring dangling from one of its long ears. It also wears a silver chain around its neck, which is believed to be a lucky charm of some sort. 

Moreover, 2803 has glasses that appear to be of human origin, although it's unclear where it acquired them. On its person is also a whistle, which it occasionally blows when it's feeling stressed or overwhelmed. 

Its species seems to give it considerable speed and agility, as demonstrated multiple times when trying to keep up with the erratic rabbit. It has a scatterbrained demeanor, often getting sidetracked or forgetful of key details. It's not uncommon for 2803 to miss important appointments or become lost in unfamiliar surroundings. 

Despite its odd traits, theories suggest that there is more to 2803 than meets the eye. Further studies will be conducted to understand its unique abilities and to confirm its presence as a sentient entity. 

Additional Notes:

2803 seems to have a natural inclination towards fashionable craftworks, whether inspired by its species or not. Its works have garnered attention among those with a taste for the eccentric and avant-garde. Although, subtly observed signs of manipulation have been fielded by D-Class personnel, causing some suspicion to its true abilities.

By request of 2803, it has manifested in a human environment to understand and incorporate all forms and concepts of beauty. Its true motivations still remain unclear.
