Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject #3796 is a highly skilled doctor and must be kept under constant observation by at least two security personnel. All communication with the subject is to be delivered via an intercom system, as all interactions must be closely monitored. Any attempts to remove or alter any of the subject's accessories must be prevented with extreme caution.

Description:

Subject #3796 is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face. Her eyes are of a highly unusual VR Jade LED colour, which glows in the dark. The subject wears her hair in pigtails, with jade earrings adorning her ears. She has a taste for luxury, sporting a gold chain around her neck and often seen with a cigarette in hand.

Personality-wise, #3796 has a dry sense of humour that can catch people off guard. Despite not being the life of the party per se, she's astonishingly skilled at delivering deadpan jokes that would have even the most serious people in stitches. However, caution is advised when interacting with her as her sense of humour may blur the lines of professionalism, especially in tense situations.

Addendum:

Subject #3796 is highly valued for her medical expertise, and her services are reserved only for those that can genuinely convince her of the necessity of her work. Any abuse of her talents may result in the suspension of her position as a doctor under the DSC foundation's employ.
