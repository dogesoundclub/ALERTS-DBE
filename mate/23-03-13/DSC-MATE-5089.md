Description: The Blue Bandit is a human male in his late 20s with a distinctive blue bandana on his head. The subject appears to have blue clown eyes, which is a possible effect of an unknown anomaly. He has a cross-shaped earring on his left ear, which appears to be green in color. He has a spot on his mouth that appears to be a dark area that contrasts with the rest of his face when he is smiling. The Blue Bandit has a particularly notable accessory - a red scarf that he wears around his neck.
