DSC-MATE-9729, codename "The Don", is a dangerous human of the male sex with a fascinating and inquisitive personality. His unusual appearance may catch one's eye with ski goggles for eyes, a blue bandana covering his head, and a gold earring adorning each ear. However, one should not be fooled by his looks. The Don is the infamous boss of one of the longest standing Mafia organizations in the dark alleys of the urban world.

Though power-hungry and feared by many, The Don has a deep curiosity about the world, which makes him an enigmatic person to deal with. He enjoys learning about obscure or even supernatural topics, and this passion has helped him gain knowledge and information about some of the most dangerous entities in the underworld.

This curiosity of his can be amusing, as he might randomly spout out obscure facts or trivial bits of information when he should be giving orders to his subordinates. However, such situations often turn into life-threatening ones, as his enemies may take this as a sign of weakness and make the mistake of underestimating him.

It is strongly advised to steer clear of The Don and his dealings, as he has established himself as a formidable force in the urban underworld, successfully commanding and expanding his criminal empire with ease. In case of unexpected encounters, caution is to be taken, and under no circumstances should anyone engage in conversation with him without explicit authorization from the higher-ups.
