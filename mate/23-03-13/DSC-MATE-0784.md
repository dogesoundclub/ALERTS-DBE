DSC-MATE-784, also known as "The Hare", is a male rabbit Real Estate Agent that possesses a unique ability to detect emotional and otherworldly disturbances. DSC-MATE-784 has a permanently frightened mouth, often appearing anxious and jittery, but compensates for this by wearing horned rim glasses to give an air of professionalism. DSC-MATE-784's green head fur is often unkempt and not arranged, but is countered by a striking gold earring, a sign of his confidence in his abilities. 

DSC-MATE-784 can often be seen wearing a gold chain and a whistle, equipment necessary for his duties in the real estate field. Despite his appearance, DSC-MATE-784 possesses a strong sense of intuition, seemingly able to predict events before they happen or sense when someone is in a state of distress. This ability sometimes calls into question whether or not he possesses psychic powers, much to the chagrin of the Foundation scientists assigned to his case. 

While DSC-MATE-784's abilities make him a valuable asset in the field, he can also be a source of unease among the population. His eerily keen senses and uncanny ability to predict the future have been both impressive and unsettling to those around him. As such, it is important for Foundation agents to keep a close eye on DSC-MATE-784, ensuring he does not draw too much attention to himself or his abilities.
