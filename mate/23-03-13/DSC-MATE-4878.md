Description:

DSC-MATE-4878 is a sapient simian that superficially resembles a non-anomalous Monkey. It is 5’8” in height and weighs approximately 150lbs. Its head is always adorned with a purple cap, and it wears a pair of horned-rimmed glasses over its eyes. DSC-MATE-4878's ears are pierced with a gold earring, and it accessorizes with a gold chain around its neck.

DSC-MATE-4878 exhibits a highly imaginative and creative personality. It is fond of creating elaborate cosplays and collecting various unusual items. DSC-MATE-4878 is also obsessed with writing poetry, often penning lengthy prose that are disjointed and abstract.

DSC-MATE-4878’s creativity can manifest as anomalous effects. DSC-MATE-4878 has the ability to imbue art objects with anomalous properties, which can be highly unpredictable. DSC-MATE-4878 has also shown the ability to possess people who view its artwork or read its poetry.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-4878 was initially observed by Foundation personnel in 199█, where it was working as a car salesman. DSC-MATE-4878 had used its anomalous abilities to imbue cars with dangerous properties that caused several accidents. The Foundation was alerted to the situation when several civilians displayed symptoms of anomalous mental possession and were admitted to regional psychiatric facilities. DSC-MATE-4878 was eventually contained after a brief confrontation with Foundation personnel.

The full extent of DSC-MATE-4878's abilities is not yet known. Research is ongoing.
