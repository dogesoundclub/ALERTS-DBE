DSC-MATE-7517, also known as "The Farmer", is a human female of extraordinary appearance. Her most prominent feature is her purple lips, which stand out starkly against her otherwise pale complexion. Her eyes are unusual as well, appearing as rainbow LED lights that give her a distinctly futuristic appearance. The top of her head is adorned with a bejeweled tiara, completing her unique look.

In addition to her striking appearance, DSC-MATE-7517 is often seen wearing a choker around her slender neck, as well as smoking a cigarette. Despite her unconventional look, The Farmer displays a flair for creativity in her work, hobbies, and interests. Possessing a vivid imagination, she can often be found writing poetry, crafting elaborate cosplay costumes, or collecting unusual and obscure objects.

DSC-MATE-7517 is not to be underestimated, as her imagination can sometimes blur the line between reality and fiction. She is to be monitored carefully, as her thought process and activities may sometimes require intervention from Foundation personnel to ensure the safety of both herself and others.
