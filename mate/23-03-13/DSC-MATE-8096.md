Item #: 8096

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

8096 is to be contained in a specially built cell reinforced with Class-D titanium, the door of which is to be only opened from the outside and operated by no fewer than three level four personnel. The enclosure is equipped with a steel mesh strong enough to confine its agility, whilst providing enough space for its maintenance. It is to be provided with an unvarying volume of bananas, coconuts and grains.

In the interest of personnel safety, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any contact be made with DSC-MATE-8096, nor any offering of bananas be made - this monkey is not the friendly type. Any verbal interaction with 8096 must be performed through a speaker and monitored by at least two level five personnel who possess remote access abilities. Any attempt to appease, lure, capture or harm 8096 is to be reported immediately to administration with a description of the incident and the personnel involved.

Description:

DSC-MATE-8096 is a twisted, rapidly-moving simian entity with malevolent intentions. Physical features include red clown eyes, a police cap, a gold earring, and a silver chain. In addition, 8096 is frequently seen with a cigarette dangling from its mouth. It is extremely agile, can weave through crowds effortlessly, and is adept at picking pockets.

It has shown an irrational dislike for researchers and shows signs of intelligence parallel to humans. This includes manipulation, planning and learning through trial and error. It seems to closely observe researchers and security personnel as though searching for weaknesses, and could potentially use this knowledge to its advantage should it be allowed freedom.

Its personality is frequently described as "quick-witted", with a tendency to engage in playful debate which can escalate into disturbing situations. It is not above physical harm to humans, and has attacked personnel and researchers in previous attempts to escape containment.

In summary, DSC-MATE-8096 is to remain under constant surveillance and in permanent containment. Any attempt to interact with it must be through remote access only, and if by any means it manages to escape, Level-4 lockdown procedures must be initiated to prevent its movement within the facility.
