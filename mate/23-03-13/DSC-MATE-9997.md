ITEM #: 9997

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

DSC-MATE-9997 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with materials allowing for artistic expression, such as paint, canvas, and paper. Due to their fast-food worker job, DSC-MATE-9997 is permitted access to the employee break room during designated break hours.

DSC-MATE-9997 is not allowed to have any physical contact with any staff or other individuals outside of authorized testing events. Communication with DSC-MATE-9997 must be conducted via intercom or through reinforced glass.

DESCRIPTION:

DSC-MATE-9997 is a human male, aged 27 years old, with green hair often seen wearing a purple cap. DSC-MATE-9997 has been observed to have red clown eyes and a terrified mouth, typically obscured by a medical mask.

Scratched into the medical mask, a broken heart can be seen. The origin of the mask is unknown. DSC-MATE-9997 is known to accessorize with a gold earring and goggles situated on their forehead.

DSC-MATE-9997 has shown a creative and artistic side, gravitating towards artistic expressions, such as drawing and painting. DSC-MATE-9997 has shown resistance to certain human-based amnestics during testing. Attempts to administer standard amnestics have resulted in heightened levels of artistic expression.

DSC-MATE-9997 is a carrier of an unknown anomalous effect, causing individuals who come in close proximity to experience heightened emotional outbursts and impulse control issues. At present, the method of transmission for this anomalous effect is unknown.

DSC-MATE-9997 is well-mannered and follows established protocol within a containment setting. However, caution should be taken when interacting with DSC-MATE-9997, and all interactions must be performed in a strictly ordered and guarded manner.

ADDENDUM:

DSC-MATE-9997 has been deemed cooperative but has shown resistance to prolonged containment. It will be necessary to secure a long-term containment plan and to identify the source of DSC-MATE-9997's anomalous effects. Further testing is required to identify the source of DSC-MATE-9997's anomalous capabilities.
