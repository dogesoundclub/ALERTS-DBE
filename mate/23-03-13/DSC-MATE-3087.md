Item #: 3087

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

3087 is a tiger of unknown origin who has adopted the ability to disguise himself as a human, specifically a beautician. His appearance includes a red beanie, gold chain, and uniquely VR jade LED eyes. Due to his erratic behavior and ability to manipulate physical objects in unconventional ways, it is suggested that a single handler takes note of 3087's movements within the community as sketched below.

Description:

3087 is a highly practical and hands-on tigerman under the guise of a male beautician. He has a tendency to repair objects with mundane methods, using duct tape or paperclips in innovative ways. They are highly secretive and avoid detection by blending in with the human populace. Under most circumstances, 3087 has displayed minimal aggression, but may become hostile when unbalanced or confronted.

Personnel who encounter 3087 are advised to proceed with caution, especially when dealing with any objects 3087 has tampered with. 3087 is highly intelligent and may have tampered with technology beyond human understanding.

Addendum:

As of date, approaches with available technology will be made to determine the nature and limitations of 3087's ability. Further testing is yet to be authorized.
