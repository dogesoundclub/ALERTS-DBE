Item #: 9961 - "The Empathetic Villain"

Species: Human

Appearance: The subject's face is adorned with vibrant orange stripes, complementing their smile. Their features, however, take a disturbing turn with their red clown eyes and their hoodie covering their head, and a medical mask hiding any other identifying marks.

Personality: The subject is a perplexing enigma. Experts suggest that their villainous role is due to their deep empathy and understanding for others. Their overwhelming compassion often leads them down a dark path, turning them into the very thing they sought to protect others from. Their penchant for animals and nature further complicates their already complex personality. The subject's emotional outbursts, mainly tears, and an uncontainable rage, make it difficult to predict their next move. 

Containment: The subject is to be contained in a specialized, soundproof cell that mimics a natural environment. Full-time supervision is required to monitor and manage the subject's unpredictable emotional state. As always, any contact with the subject is prohibited, and all those who interacted with the subject will be placed under strict observation.
 
Note: The subject is not to be underestimated, for their capacity to both protect and destroy in the name of empathy is seemingly boundless.
