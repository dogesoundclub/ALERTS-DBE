DogeSoundClub Data Containment Sheet #7533

Subject #7533, also known as Officer Orange, is a male human police officer who exhibits several strange physical features. He has bright orange stripes across his face, and his eyes have been replaced with VR Rainbow LED technology. Officer Orange often wears a red beanie and a gold earring in one ear.
