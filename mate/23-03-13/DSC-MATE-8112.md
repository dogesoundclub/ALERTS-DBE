Subject 8112, also known as "the Curious Villain", is a human female with distinct features that make her stand out from the crowd. She sports orange stripes on her face, giving her an animalistic appearance that only adds to her mysterious aura. A bold red lip stands out against her pale skin, drawing attention to her full pout.

The subject's eyes are hidden behind a pair of normal glasses, suggesting a bookish and intellectual quality to her. Her head is often adorned with a rainbow festival hat, further emphasizing her eccentricity. Green cross earrings hang from her ears, adding a touch of punk rock vibes.

At all times, the subject wears a medical mask, perhaps an intentional statement of dissociation and disconnection from the world around her. A simple choker, often adorned with strange or otherworldly pendants, completes her ensemble.

Though she is classified as a villain, the subject's primary characteristic is her insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She possesses an immense knowledge of obscure and unusual topics, and loves to share her knowledge with others. This can lead to humorous situations, with her randomly spouting obscure facts or trivia to unsuspecting individuals.

Subject 8112 is a formidable enigma, one whose complexities and strangeness make her a unique and fascinating enemy. Approach with caution.
