Subject #9381, also known as "The Manager", is a human male with a charming smile that can light up a room. He dons a retro cap on his head, which perfectly complements his nerdy glasses and a jade earring that he never takes off. The Manager also sports a red scarf around his neck and always carries a candy stick that he absentmindedly twirls between his fingers.

The Manager is a natural-born leader, and his skills are on full display as the Theater Manager. He takes charge of situations with ease, whether it's during a performance or behind the scenes. His natural charisma and leadership skills make him a favorite among his colleagues, and they all look up to him. He's equally adept at handling social situations, and his vibrant personality makes him a hit with almost everyone he meets.

However, there's more to The Manager than just his charming personality. There have been reports of strange phenomena happening around him. Coincidences that could only be explained as deliberate actions have occurred when he is present. Lights flicker, objects move on their own, and even the weather seems to respond to his moods. DogeSoundClub is keeping a close eye on The Manager, as his true capabilities are still unknown. Perhaps he's merely a charismatic leader, or maybe he's something else entirely. Either way, The Manager is a force to be reckoned with, and DogeSoundClub will be keeping a close eye on him.
