DogeSoundClub Containment Report #1215

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-1215, formerly known as [REDACTED], must be contained at all times within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Due to DSC-MATE-1215's status as a traffic officer, they are allowed to leave their chamber only for testing and official Foundation business, under the supervision of at least two level 3 researchers.

DSC-MATE-1215 must wear a Foundation-issued VR headset at all times, allowing remote monitoring of their actions and physical location. Any attempts to remove or disable the headset must be met with immediate action to prevent loss of containment.

Description:

DSC-MATE-1215 appears as a standard human male, with a short peak cap, green cross earring, and silver chain as accessories. However, their eyes are a non-standard feature, appearing as spinning VR jade LED lights.

DSC-MATE-1215's personality tends to be extremely energetic and enthusiastic, with a love of getting others excited about things. This orientation toward excitement can lead to humorous situations as DSC-MATE-1215 grows overly enthusiastic about things that others do not find interesting.

Due to their unique eyes, DSC-MATE-1215 can hack into traffic cameras, and has been observed manipulating traffic flow patterns in controlled testing. However, this ability is limited and can be disrupted by simple antivirus measures.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1215 has exhibited a desire to explore the surrounding area outside of their containment chamber, with several incidents of forced extraction noted. As such, it is recommended that Foundation staff ensure adequate containment measures and monitoring for DSC-MATE-1215 at all times.
