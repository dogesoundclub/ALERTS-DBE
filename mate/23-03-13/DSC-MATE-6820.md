Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-6820 is to be monitored on a daily basis and any unusual behavior must be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation agent. DSC-MATE-6820 shall not be allowed to interact with civilians outside of his role as a Traffic Officer, and must always be accompanied by at least one Foundation personnel in all public events. In the event that DSC-MATE-6820 becomes distressed or displays signs of mental instability, sedative injections must be administered immediately.

Description:
DSC-MATE-6820, also known as Officer Green, is a human male with spots on his face and green hair. He often wears a purple cap, a red scarf, and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, DSC-MATE-6820 has a distinctive two-color band on his forehead. These traits make DSC-MATE-6820 easily identifiable in public settings.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-6820 is empathetic and compassionate, often taking on other people's problems as his own. This quality makes him an excellent Traffic Officer, as he is able to deescalate any potential conflicts that may arise. However, such compassion can sometimes be overwhelming, leading to DSC-MATE-6820 becoming fatigued from the sheer amount of problems he's attempted to fix. In a closed setting, DSC-MATE-6820 may exhibit behavior such as excessive talking, irritability, and a tendency to become emotionally overwhelmed if subjected to too much stress.

Additional Notes:
DSC-MATE-6820's empathetic and compassionate nature is a valuable trait when dealing with civilians on a daily basis. However, it is of utmost importance that Foundation personnel keep an eye on him at all times, as DSC-MATE-6820 is susceptible to emotional overloads that may affect his ability to deal with anomalous activity.
