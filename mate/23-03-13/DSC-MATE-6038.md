DSC-MATE-6038, codenamed "The Green Guard", is a human male creature of unknown origin working at Site-██ as a Security Guard. His most notable physical trait is the green layers covering his head, which seem to grant him enhanced physical strength and quick reflexes, making him an effective security asset. He also wears a pair of nerd glasses that he always adjusts with his finger, suggesting a strong attention to detail and the ability to scrutinize any situation in front of him.

Despite his imposing figure, DSC-MATE-6038 has a charming smile that instantly puts those around him at ease. He often cracks jokes and shares humorous anecdotes, giving him the nickname amongst Foundation personnel as the "Jester of Security". However, it is noted that his jovial nature can sometimes clash with the serious nature of the Foundation's work, leading to reprimands from superiors.

Additionally, DSC-MATE-6038 never goes without his trusty medical mask, which he claims to wear to protect himself and to make himself look more official. On his forehead, he always wears a set of goggles, though their purpose remains unknown beyond his stated reason of "fashion sense". Finally, he adorns himself with a gold chain, instead of the typical security lanyard that most personnel use.

Personnel are reminded that while DSC-MATE-6038 is a valuable asset to the Foundation with his quick reflexes, wit, and physical abilities, his tendency to make light of serious situations should be taken into consideration when assigning him specific tasks.
