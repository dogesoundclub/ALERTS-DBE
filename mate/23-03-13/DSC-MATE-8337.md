DSC-MATE-8337, also known as "Pyro," is a male rabbit of unknown origins employed as a firefighter. His most prominent facial feature is his frightened mouth, which often quivers with fear when faced with danger. Despite this, his eyes are equipped with VR rainbow LED technology, granting him excellent night vision which he puts to use when battling urban fires.

DSC-MATE-8337's head is a chaotic mess of green fur, seemingly never combed or arranged in any particular fashion. He also sports a goggle on his forehead, providing additional protection from smoke and debris. Additionally, he has a single gold earring adorning one ear, likely a personal fashion statement.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-8337 is a bit of a risk-taker, often acting impulsively and recklessly, without fully considering the consequences. This propensity to act before he thinks things through can lead to comical mishaps, and sometimes, more serious incidents. Nevertheless, Pyro remains a dedicated and fearless firefighter, despite his occasional lack of judgment.

Overall, DSC-MATE-8337 is an intriguing and dynamic character, adding a unique flavor to any urban fantasy setting. However, caution is advised when interacting with this individual, given his tendency towards spontaneous actions.
