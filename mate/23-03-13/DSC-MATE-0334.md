Item #: 334

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-334 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any personnel required to enter DSC-MATE-334's cell must be trained in simian behavior and handling. DSC-MATE-334 is to be provided with organic matter food and water twice per day. DSC-MATE-334 is allowed to request additional nutritional supplements as required, and psychological care should be provided upon request.

In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to avoid making any sudden movements or loud noises, as DSC-MATE-334 may interpret them as a threat or aggression.

Description:

DSC-MATE-334, also known as "Dr. Darwin," is a male primate with distinctive horned rim glasses and a blue bandana around its head. DSC-MATE-334 also has a jade earring in its left ear.

DSC-MATE-334 is a licensed veterinarian with a specialization in primate care, and possesses human-level intelligence and communication abilities. Dr. Darwin speaks English fluently and is capable of complex problem-solving.

However, DSC-MATE-334 is prone to impulsive behavior and often acts on its emotions rather than rational thought. This results in situations that can be amusing to onlookers but potentially dangerous to others. DSC-MATE-334 is capable of suppressing its impulsive tendencies, but only with great effort.

DSC-MATE-334 can be cooperative with researchers and other DSCs, with a particular affinity for primates. However, it has been noted that DSC-MATE-334 has exhibited loyalty to the Foundation above all else, indicating that it attempts to self-regulate its behavior.

Addendum 334-A:

DSC-MATE-334 became an DSC following an incident in which it released an unusually aggressive chimp into a pop star's hotel room in response to a perceived insult. DSC-MATE-334 was apprehended by Foundation agents and transferred to containment.
