DSC-MATE-648 is a peculiar specimen indeed. Classified as a human, one might think there is nothing out of the ordinary about him. However, his appearance may suggest otherwise. Sporting an unorthodox collection of accessories, including a retro cap and a silver chain, his most prominent features are his red clown-like eyes and the spots on his face that almost seem to glow in the dark. But do not let his odd look fool you, as DSC-MATE-648 is a fast food worker by profession, and his day-to-day duties seem to not have affected his demeanor.

This one is undoubtedly a curious creature, with a thirst for knowledge that plunges him in a world of unusual and obscure topics. Despite this, he is approachable and friendly, often engaging in conversations with others, raising their awareness with random facts or trivia they may never have heard before. DSC-MATE-648's love for knowledge may seem harmless, but the Foundationsâ€™ analysts remain vigilant, forewarning that this characteristic may be the principal instrument that he uses to survive. Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-648 remains cooperative and content with his station in life, making him an easily controlled asset in this dangerous urban landscape.
