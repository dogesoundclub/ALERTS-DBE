DogeSoundClub Containment Report for Subject 3046:

Subject 3046, codenamed "The Obsessive," is a human male currently employed as a security guard. His appearance is distinguished by his orange stripes, which run across his face and give him an unusual but not overtly intimidating look. His choice of accessory is a LED gas mask, which is attached to his person at all times.

The Obsessive's personality is characterized by an extreme attention to detail, which can manifest in mundane or peculiar ways. His habit of alphabetizing his spice rack may seem harmless enough, but his need to color-code his closet suggests that his obsessiveness may extend to all aspects of his life. While interviewing him for the purposes of this report, it was clear that he is easily distracted by the slightest disorder or deviation from the norm, which makes him a liability in certain high-stress situations.

In terms of containment procedures, Subject 3046 is to be monitored closely by security personnel for any unusual behavior or signs of agitation. Due to his obsessive tendencies and the unique challenges that may pose in a crisis situation, it is recommended that he be paired with a colleague who is more adaptable and able to handle chaotic events. The Obsessive's physical capabilities are normal for a human male of his age and build, and there is no evidence to suggest that he possesses any anomalous abilities beyond his personality traits.

Under no circumstances should Subject 3046 be allowed access to sensitive information or research materials, as his obsessiveness may lead to an unintentional breach of protocol. Those in contact with him should take care to minimize any visual or auditory distractions, and avoid any actions or statements that might trigger a counterproductive obsession. With proper monitoring and respectful treatment, it is believed that The Obsessive can be a valuable and effective asset to the Foundation's security force.
