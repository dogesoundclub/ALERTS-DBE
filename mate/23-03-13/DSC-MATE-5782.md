Item #: 5782

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 5782 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to the subject's occupation as a fashion designer, the chamber should be furnished with various fabrics, patterns, and design equipment to stave off any potential outbursts. Subject 5782 is to wear their unique attire at all times, ensuring the gas mask remains secure and undamaged. Any attempt to remove the gas mask without expressed permission from Level 4 personnel is prohibited.

Description:

Subject 5782 is a male humanoid with orange stripes on their face, along with ski goggle eyes and a green cross earring in their left ear. The subject appears to be in their mid-thirties and stands at 5’10’’ tall, with a slender build. Subject 5782 identifies as a human, although their unique features suggest otherwise. Their clothing is eccentric, to say the least, often possessing an aggressive flair with an added touch of haute couture. Subject 5782 is most often seen wearing a normal gas mask, which is presumed to serve a vital function to their survival.

Personality:

Subject 5782 is quite analytical and logical, often engaging in debates and arguments with others for fun. This trait can lead to humorous situations, causing the subject to take up trivial or unimportant topics, and become increasingly passionate about them. Subject 5782 also has an unyielding passion for fashion, and will often refuse to wear any clothing that they deem unsettling or uncomfortable. At times, they may become overwhelmed with stress, further revealing their emotional instability.

Additional Notes:

Subject 5782's strange appearance and eccentric personality may give the impression of a being of anomalous origin. However, tests and interviews have confirmed the subject as a human, albeit with some physiognomical differences. Still, with their often-volatile behavior, Subject 5782 is to be treated with caution and respect to prevent any outbursts or potential harm to staff and researchers.
