Deemed safe to live among humans, DSC-MATE-1046 has taken up the job of a train driver, and it is known to be diligent and meticulous while fulfilling its duties. However, one must exercise caution while in DSC-MATE-1046's presence since it has a knack for being a little too mindful of its animosity. Occasional flashbacks have shown aggression in the past, and the potential dangers it poses must not be underestimated.

DSC-MATE-1046's intellect prompts it to be a people-pleaser, often going out of its way to leave an impression on them. It makes for an excellent ally and blends into urban settings quickly. The creature's obsession with gift-giving stems from its heightened sense of observation, allowing it to notice subtle details about any person it comes across.

One must maintain a safe distance from DSC-MATE-1046 when selecting gifts for it as well. This is due to the creature's tendency to get overly fixated on being perfect, stressing over its choice for extended periods before settling on anything. This susceptibility to stress has been studied closely by the research team, and its effects have to be continually monitored.

To summarize, DSC-MATE-1046 is a peculiar specimen that should be approached with caution, but can also prove to be a beneficial addition to any given situation.
