Item #: DSC-MATE-4466

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-4466 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. While DSC-MATE-4466 is not exhibiting any anomalous properties, it is to be allowed regular access to the internet, as well as materials necessary for the hobbies and interests listed in its personality profile.

DSC-MATE-4466 is a delivery driver and as such, is allowed to leave its containment chamber for work purposes. It is to be accompanied by a security detail at all times while outside of containment.

Description:

DSC-MATE-4466 appears to be a human male of average height and build. The individual is frequently seen wearing a short peak cap, which obscures the majority of its hair. DSC-MATE-4466 has two notable facial features, a small spot on its lips and a frightened mouth that appears to be a result of repeated pursing of the lips.

The individual has a red scarf and a pair of goggles that sit on its forehead. Additionally, it has a two-color band on its forehead but the purpose of these features remains unknown.

DSC-MATE-4466â€™s personality is unique in that it is highly creative and has a vivid imagination. It may engage in unusual hobbies, such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, or collecting unusual objects. However, DSC-MATE-4466 displays no anomalous abilities related to its personality.

DSC-MATE-4466 was submitted to Foundation custody following multiple reports of an individual in possession of unusual objects and engaging in erratic behavior during delivery runs. The subsequent search of DSC-MATE-4466's person produced a number of objects exhibiting minor anomalous properties, but all were determined to be minor and easily contained.

Addendum:

While DSC-MATE-4466 poses no immediate threat, personnel are reminded that the potential for anomalous behavior should never be ignored.
