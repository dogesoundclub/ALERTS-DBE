Item #: 1496

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1496, also known as the "Beautician," is to be kept under close surveillance at all times. The subject must be detained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, under lock and key, and regularly monitored by CCTV. Interaction with the subject must be conducted with caution and only authorized personnel may enter the containment chamber.

Description:

Subject 1496 is a seemingly ordinary human female, with orange stripes on her face and a smile that never leaves. Her most striking feature is her blue clown eyes, which are unnaturally large and give her a unique appearance. She also sports goggles on her forehead, protruding from an orange side of her head. Her ears are adorned with beautiful jade earrings that are a sharp contrast to her eccentric appearance.

Personality:

The subject appears to be an introverted individual, often lost in thought and daydreaming. Despite her introverted nature, she is sociable with others and has a knack for making people feel comfortable in her presence. Her personality is mild-mannered, and she does not exhibit any outward aggression or hostility.

However, her tendency to become lost in thought has resulted in frequent accidents, such as tripping over objects or walking into poles. She also displays a quirk where she frequently taps her foot or hums to herself when lost in thought. The origin of this behavior is currently unknown.

Addendum:

Subject 1496's powers and potential danger level are yet to be determined. Further investigation is required to understand the nature and extent of her abilities. Until then, utmost caution must be exercised when dealing with this individual.
