DogeSoundClub Secure Containment Protocol for Subject #23,

Subject #23 is a human male train driver with identification number #23. He displays a variety of unique physical features, including spots on his face, a friendly smile, and nerd glasses over his eyes. He possesses a head of normal blonde hair and wears a medical mask over his mouth as a precautionary measure.

Despite his profession as a train driver, Subject #23 has exhibited a scatterbrained and forgetful personality. This results in often amusing and humorous situations such as forgetting appointments and getting lost while exploring new places.

The Foundation has observed that these peculiar characteristics could stem from an anomaly that may possess a corresponding effect on the subject's memory retention and attention span. To minimize the potential risks, the subject must undergo cognitive and psychological evaluations regularly and have a designated transport coordinator to monitor his train routes.

Subject #23 is currently being monitored and contained by the Foundation within a designated facility. Any attempts at communication or unauthorized access have been deemed strictly prohibited.
