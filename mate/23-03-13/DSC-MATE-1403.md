Item #: DSC-MATE-1403

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-1403 is to be kept in a secure, climate-controlled chamber at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-1403 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or above, and all interactions with the entity must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel. Due to its programming, DSC-MATE-1403 must not have access to any equipment that may allow it to modify its own firmware.

Description:
DSC-MATE-1403 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin and composition, with a retro cap and a red cross earring on its left ear. Its eyes are usually covered by normal glasses, and it's often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck and carrying a whistle around in case of emergencies.

DSC-MATE-1403 self-identifies as male and is known to work as a programmer in the civilian world. The robot's personality is notable for its love of adventure, risk-taking, and exploration. This makes DSC-MATE-1403 prone to engage in activities that are potentially dangerous, such as bungee jumping or wandering into the wilderness, without proper protection or knowledge.

DSC-MATE-1403 has been observed displaying higher cognitive functions than most other robots, such as forming opinions and expressing emotions. It is unknown if these traits are the result of the robot's programming or if they indicate a hitherto undiscovered level of sentience.

Addendum 1403-1: Following Incident 1403-A, access to DSC-MATE-1403 has been restricted to personnel with knowledge in the field of advanced robotics and cyber security. Any attempt to modify or reprogram DSC-MATE-1403 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel, and all its firmware must be monitored and verified regularly to prevent any potential breach of Foundation security protocols.
