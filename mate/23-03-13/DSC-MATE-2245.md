DSC-MATE-2245, also known by its code name "The Harebrained Anchor," is a male rabbit of unknown origin working as a news anchor in a major metropolitan city. Its head is covered in a thick coat of green fur that appears unkempt and disheveled, with no identifiable pattern or style. Forehead feature #1 displays two distinct color bands that appear to shift and change depending on DSC-MATE-2245's emotional state, ranging from a bright, cheerful yellow to a deep, moody blue.

Perched atop its head are two large ears, one of which is adorned with a single jade earring that appears to glow with an otherworldly light. DSC-MATE-2245's attention to detail and keen observant nature make it an expert gift-giver, able to find the perfect present for anyone. However, this gift-giving prowess comes at a cost, as DSC-MATE-2245 can become overly fixated on finding the ideal gift, often fretting over minor details and obsessing over various options for hours on end.

DSC-MATE-2245's origins and motivations remain a mystery, and its bizarre appearance and unusual behavior have led many to speculate that it may be part of a larger supernatural phenomenon. Further investigation into the nature of DSC-MATE-2245 is ongoing, and the Foundation is constantly monitoring its activities for any signs of anomalous behavior.
