DSC-MATE-993, also known as "The News Anchor," is a male human with striking features that define his unique appearance. His eyes are permanently replaced by ski goggles, which seem to aid his vision in low-light environments. The top of his head sports a wild mohawk that extends several inches in height, while his piercing green cross earring adds an element of mystery to his personality. DSC-MATE-993 is never seen without a red scarf draped around his neck and a medical mask covering his mouth. 

DSC-MATE-993 can come across as unpredictable, with a tendency to act impulsively even in situations where caution might be the better choice. Despite some humorous moments that arise from his spontaneity, it is believed that DSC-MATE-993's wild streak may arise from a darker history that he keeps hidden away. His profession as a news anchor has given him a natural charisma and skill with words, qualities that are sometimes used to deflect attention away from his true motives. Approach with caution and always be mindful of his devious tactics.
