DSC-MATE-1107, also known as "Hopper," is a male rabbit who works as a veterinarian in the city. His frightened mouth and jade LED eyes give him a somewhat timid appearance, but don't let that fool you. Hopper exudes a natural charm and charisma that can captivate any audience, making him the life of the party.

Often seen wearing a retro cap and a red scarf, Hopper also has a penchant for smoking cigarettes, which may or may not contribute to his cool demeanor. Despite his playful nature, Hopper takes his job as a veterinarian seriously and is highly skilled at treating all species of animals, including those of the paranormal variety.

At times, Hopper's humor can get the best of him, leading to some comical situations, such as reciting puns or doing silly dances to make others laugh. Nevertheless, he is a valuable member of the urban fantasy community, providing medical care for both the mundane and the supernatural. Despite his timid appearance, Hopper's natural charm and charisma make him a force to be reckoned with.
