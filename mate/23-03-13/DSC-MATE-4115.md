Subject 4115, also known as "The Monk," is a human male who exhibits a unique combination of traits that make him a formidable adversary. Despite his calm and collected demeanor, it is clear that he is not to be trifled with.

The Monk's most striking feature is his virtual reality rainbow LED eyes, which seem to shift between colors and patterns depending on his mood. Coupled with his frightened mouth, his expression can be difficult to read, and he often appears to be lost in thought.

He wears a pair of goggles on his forehead, perhaps as a means of shielding his sensitive eyes from the bright lights of the city. His gold earring and chain add a touch of flair to his otherwise austere appearance.

While he may look unapproachable and even intimidating to some, the Monk possesses a deep empathy and understanding of others. He is easily moved to tears or emotional outbursts when he witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. His connection to nature and animals is also notable, and he has been observed spending time in parks or feeding stray animals.

As a villain, the Monk is a force to be reckoned with, and his ability to connect with others on a deeper level makes him a formidable opponent. Caution is advised when engaging with this individual.
