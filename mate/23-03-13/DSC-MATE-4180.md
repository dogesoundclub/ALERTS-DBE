Designation number 4180 is a unique urban fantasy character, known for his striking appearance and empathetic personality. Born as a rare species of Tiger, he has adapted well to the human world, taking up a job as a car salesman. The remarkable feature of 4180 is his Ski Goggle eyes that glow in the dark, making it easier for him to navigate through the city's night streets. 

Sporting a blue bandana on his head, the 4180 also has an unusual earring adorning his right ear - a red cross emblem. This symbolism may suggest a connection to some mysterious organization or might be a personal choice that he has made. He also likes to wear a red scarf around his neck, complimenting his already striking appearance. 

The most exceptional accessory that he carries around is a candy stick which he is always chewing on. The reason behind this choice of snack is yet to be disclosed to the public, but it adds to the enigma of this character. 

Personality-wise, he is a compassionate and kindness-driven soul who understands pain and suffering better than anyone else. He is so deeply empathetic that he even gets moved to tears when coming across someone else's misfortune. This quality sets him apart, making him an ideal confidante for those who have trouble sharing their feelings. 

4180's caring nature also extends to animals and nature. He has been known to take in abandoned animals and nurse them back to health, and often volunteers for environmental causes. This tiger has truly embraced the human race and is using his abilities to contribute to society.
