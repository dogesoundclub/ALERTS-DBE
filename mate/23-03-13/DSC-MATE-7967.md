Subject 7967 is a female human of unknown age and origin, employed as a lawyer in the urban metropolitan area. Her facial features are notably abnormal; orange tiger stripes adorn her cheeks while the corners of her thin lips curve upwards into an ever-present smile. Her eyes are a startling red shade commonly found in circus clowns, standing out against her pale complexion. Pigtail braids are styled atop her head, adding an element of whimsy to her otherwise professional appearance.

Two colored bands decorate her smooth forehead, while a pair of goggles rests atop, never donned but perhaps contributing to her unique sense of style. Her ears are adorned with gold hoops, adding a touch of decadence to her overall appearance.

Her empathetic and compassionate nature makes her well-equipped for her role as a lawyer, but can lead to her taking on issues that are not her own. She often feels an overwhelming responsibility to solve any problem that she encounters, even if it is not within her power to do so. This drive to help others can be admirable, but can also lead to her exhaustion and burnout. Approach with caution, as Subject 7967's ability to fix any problem may also turn her into one.
