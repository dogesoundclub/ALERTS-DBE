DSC-MATE-8145, also known as "The Electric Hare," is a unique specimen of the Oryctolagus cuniculus species. This male rabbit stands at a height of 1.2 meters, and is easily identifiable by the blue bandana tied around its head, and the gold chain that adorns its neck.

Despite its humble appearance, DSC-MATE-8145 possesses an exceptional talent when it comes to electrical work. As an electrician, it has been observed to perform tasks with unparalleled speed and precision, often completing jobs that would take a human several hours in mere minutes.

However, this talented rabbit does have its quirks. DSC-MATE-8145 is prone to forgetfulness, often becoming engrossed in its own thoughts or work, and losing track of time. Although it is usually harmless, this absent-mindedness has caused some minor inconveniences within the Foundation, such as missed appointments or delayed reports.

Despite these minor issues, DSC-MATE-8145 is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly when it comes to handling electrical anomalies. Its expertise in this field has proven invaluable in containing and neutralizing dangerous electrically-charged entities.

As such, DSC-MATE-8145 is to be treated with the utmost care and respect, and is to be provided with all necessary resources to continue its valuable work.
