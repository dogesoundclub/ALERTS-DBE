Item #: 7873


Object Class: Safe


Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 7873 is to be housed in a standard living quarter within the containment facilities. The subject is allowed to carry on with their regular duties as a firefighter. However, they are to be monitored at all times for any unusual behavior. Any gifts received from the subject are to be thoroughly inspected for any possible anomalies before being given to the intended recipient.


Description:

Subject 7873 is a human male with an unarranged mop of green hair, normal glasses and a medical mask over his mouth. His forehead sports a pair of goggles which he often wears when not in use. Subject 7873 also wears a jade earring on one ear and a gold chain around his neck.

Personality wise, subject 7873 possesses a keen eye for detail, making them excellent observers as well as gift-givers. However, they often obsess over giving the 'perfect' gift, causing them to overanalyze and take a lot of time deciding on a present. 


Addendum:

Subject 7873 first came to the Foundation's attention when several reports of unusually lucky and successful firefighting missions were reported from the police department. However, when the Foundation investigated, they found that the cause was actually subject 7873's strange gift-giving abilities. Subject 7873 would make small gifts to his fellow firefighters, which would provide them with temporary bursts of good luck and energy. While initially skeptical, Foundation researchers have confirmed that subject 7873's gifts are not simply coincidences but have actual anomalous properties.

As such, subject 7873 has been recruited into the Foundation as a possible future DSC. More information is being gathered on the extent of subject 7873's anomalous abilities to determine appropriate containment procedures.
