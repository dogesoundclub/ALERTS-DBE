DSC-MATE-6819, also known as "The Salesman", is a human male of indeterminate age who works as a car salesman. He possesses distinct facial spots and often dons a retro cap on his head. His most notable features, however, are the normal glasses over his eyes and the red scarf he adorns around his neck. 

But what sets 6819 apart from other mundane salespeople is his LED gas mask, which he never takes off. Its constant glowing light is rumored to have anomalous properties that allow The Salesman to persuade even the most unlikely of customers into buying his products. 

DSC-MATE-6819's ambitious and goal-oriented nature has been observed by Foundation agents, causing him to sometimes take on more than he can handle. However, this trait proves to serve him well in his work, as he can manage and sell vehicles with strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills. 

Although there is no evidence to suggest DSC-MATE-6819 possesses any paranormal abilities beyond his mask, high-level Foundation personnel still regard him with caution. All interactions with The Salesman should be documented and reported to Foundation authorities promptly.
