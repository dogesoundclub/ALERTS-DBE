DSC-MATE-8235 is a highly intelligent, anthropomorphic tiger with a prominent candy stick always in use. Despite their seemingly intimidating appearance, the veterinarian approaches all patients with a gentle yet frightened mouth. Their eyes are strikingly intense and filled with knowledge, though our team has yet to fully comprehend their true meaning. 

DSC-MATE-8235's obsessive need for routine and lack of flexibility has been observed on multiple occasions. In situations where deviation from established practices is required, the tiger has exhibited resistance and even frustration. However, they have also proven to be extremely reliable and organized, ensuring that all medical facilities are in perfect order at all times.

DSC-MATE-8235's veterinary skills surpass any known human or animal practitioner. His expertise in the treatment of all species is astounding, making him an invaluable resource to the Foundation. However, as with his routine obsessions, the tiger has a hard time accepting new ideas or accepting changes. This can lead to some rather amusing moments when unexpected situations arise, often resulting in the tiger being humbled by their inability to adapt.

Despite their stubbornness, DSC-MATE-8235 remains an invaluable asset to the Foundation, often working tirelessly to ensure the health and well-being of all creatures within the facility. Efforts to gain greater insight into the nature of this unique creature's mind continue.
