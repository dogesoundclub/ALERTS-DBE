Item #: DSC-MATE-5666

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-5666 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The subject is to be kept restrained with appropriate restraints and monitored remotely at all times. Any communication with DSC-MATE-5666 is to be conducted through a secure audiovisual transmission system until further notice.

Description:

DSC-MATE-5666 appears to be a human male in his mid-forties, bearing the appearance of a mafia boss. The subject wears a purple cap with a headset over his balding head, with a gold earring in his left ear. The subject's mouth is always covered with a medical mask, with a notable spot on the lower lip area. DSC-MATE-5666 also wears a silver chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-5666 exhibits a rather peculiar personality. The subject tends to be very introspective, often spending long periods lost in thought, daydreaming, or engaging in deep contemplation. This has led to several humorous situations in the past, such as the subject walking into poles or tripping over objects while lost in thought.

Despite the subject's apparent humorous nature, there is an air of danger about DSC-MATE-5666. The subject's affiliation with organized crime and the actions of his organization suggest that he is not to be taken lightly.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-5666 is a high-value target for the Foundation's investigation into anomalous crime syndicates. Any information regarding DSC-MATE-5666's involvement in anomalous activity is to be reported immediately to the Foundation's task force on anomalous criminal enterprises (Task Force Epsilon-13, "The Mafia Hunters"). Additional containment procedures may be implemented pending further investigation.
