DSC-MATE-1687, also known as "The Monkey Theater Manager," is a male monkey of unknown origin. He is distinguishable by his vibrant VR Rainbow LED eyes, which glow in a variety of colors and patterns. DSC-MATE-1687 is typically seen wearing a gold chain around his neck, as well as holding a cigarette in his hand.

DSC-MATE-1687 works as the manager of a theater, where he displays his practical and hands-on personality. He's known to fix problems in unconventional ways, using duct tape or paper clips to repair damages or rigging up makeshift solutions to problems that others might find complicated. His resourcefulness is often invaluable to the theater, but his methods can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous.

DSC-MATE-1687's presence in the theater has been attributed to his species' high intelligence and remarkable ability to mimic human behavior. There are rumors that he may have stolen the position from a human manager, but these claims remain unverified.

Attempts to relocate DSC-MATE-1687 to a suitable environment have been met with resistance from the monkey, who seems to have developed a strong attachment to the theater and its patrons. It is recommended that any interaction with DSC-MATE-1687 be done with caution, as he may become aggressive if cornered or threatened.
