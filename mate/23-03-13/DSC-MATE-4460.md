Description: 4460 appears to be a male monkey of indeterminate species, with a penchant for practical problem-solving and a love of tinkering. Their eyes are uncharacteristic of their species and appear to be ski goggles, which obstruct any view of their actual eyes. Their head is covered by a purple baseball cap adorned with a headset, and a goggle rests just above their forehead. One of their ears features a gold earring, while their neck is adorned with a silver chain. They also possess a whistle that they seem to use frequently during their daily activities.
