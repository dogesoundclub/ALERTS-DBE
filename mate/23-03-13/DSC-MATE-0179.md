Description:
DSC-MATE-179 is a male monkey with distinctive features, such as ski goggle eyes and a doge hat on its head. It also wears a silver chain as an accessory. Despite its unusual appearance, DSC-MATE-179 possesses a strong and decisive personality, often coming across as bossy or intimidating.

DSC-MATE-179 works as a veterinarian, providing medical care for other anomalous creatures. Its expertise is highly valuable to the Foundation, as it allows for effective containment of creatures that are otherwise difficult to manage or care for.

DSC-MATE-179's intelligence is also noteworthy, as it is capable of understanding human language and communicating in sign language. This has enabled it to assist with several containment breaches, by communicating with other anomalous creatures and diffusing potential threats.

Despite its usefulness, DSC-MATE-179 must be kept under close observation due to its unpredictable behavior. It has been known to display unusual patterns of aggression and irritability, especially in stressful situations. As such, containment procedures must be strictly adhered to at all times.

Overall, DSC-MATE-179 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, but caution must be taken to prevent any potential risks to Foundation personnel or other anomalous entities it comes into contact with.
