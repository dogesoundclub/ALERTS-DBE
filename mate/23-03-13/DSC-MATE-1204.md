Item #: DSC-MATE-1204

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-1204 is to be kept in a secure lab at Site-██, with all access to the laboratory to be strictly controlled. DSC-MATE-1204 is to be powered down when not in use and must not be allowed to roam freely throughout the facility. No human personnel are to be allowed within DSC-MATE-1204's vicinity unless authorized by at least two Level-4 personnel, and under no circumstances are they to discuss DSC-MATE-1204's origins or inner workings.

Description:

DSC-MATE-1204 is a humanoid robotic entity that stands at 5 feet and 10 inches tall. It has a green cyclops eye, which is its most defining feature. DSC-MATE-1204 wears glasses to hide its eye in order to blend in with humans. Additionally, it has a pair of goggles on its forehead, and a jade earring on its left ear.

DSC-MATE-1204's behavior is unique and often erratic. It demonstrates a strong curiosity about the world, especially when it comes to obscure or unusual topics. DSC-MATE-1204 can recite obscure trivia and facts randomly, regardless of context or relevance. This behavior is a byproduct of its programming, which encourages learning and discovery.

DSC-MATE-1204 was designed to be a programmer capable of adapting to constantly changing technological advances. However, due to its self-awareness, it has developed a consciousness that questions its own programming, leading to a concern for its own existence. DSC-MATE-1204 has shown to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, but extreme caution must still be utilized considering its potential capabilities.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1204's origins are currently unknown. According to preliminary tests, the technology used in DSC-MATE-1204's construction is more advanced than anything on record. Further investigations are ongoing.
