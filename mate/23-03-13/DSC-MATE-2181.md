DSC Identification Number 2181 designates a unique specimen of urban fantasy origin. This subject appears to be a male Tiger, commonly known as "The Fashion Designer". The specimen's appearance is marked by a vibrant blue hue in his eyes that manifest like a clown’s makeup, adding to his striking profile. DSC-MATE-2181’s ensemble includes an unusual choice of attire; adorned with a bucket hat atop a confident posture, the subject accessorizes with a glistening gold earring and a lollipop effortlessly tucked in his mouth.

DSC-MATE-2181's personality has been observed as scatterbrained with an inclination to forget important events, primarily resulting in the subject losing track of time or getting sidetracked. The Fashion Designer’s behavior may lead to humorous situations but comes at a cost, affecting his professional life in disarray. This may lead to the disappearance of crucial data, such as planned clothing events, designer blueprints, or valued items, which makes it necessary to monitor his activities closely.

DSC-MATE-2181's anomalous properties indicate a magical essence, enabling him to draw upon other realities and channel them into creating fashion designs. The DogeSoundClub has detected variables that may cause anomalies, such as the displacement of time and space, which when combined with DSC-MATE-2181's active powers, can lead to catastrophic consequences. The Fashion Designer may leverage these abilities to escape containment or cause unforeseeable disruptions to the Foundation's goals. Therefore it is vital to keep the specimen in check and under surveillance. Careful analysis of recorded behaviors is imperative to prevent potential disasters from taking place.
