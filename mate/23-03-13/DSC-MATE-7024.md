Item #: DSC-MATE-7024

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-7024 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. It is allowed to keep its red beanie and gold earring as non-threatening objects. However, its cigarette must be confiscated upon entry and all attempts to provide it with a lighter or other ignition source must be prevented. Due to its tiger-like appearance, all personnel are warned not to engage with DSC-MATE-7024 directly unless specifically authorized to do so.

Description:
DSC-MATE-7024 is a male tiger humanoid, standing at approximately 2 meters tall. It currently works as a real estate agent under an assumed name, but the DogeSoundClub has been monitoring its activities for several months. Its appearance is distinct, with a constant expression of fear on its mouth and forehead, and a two-color band marking its forehead. DSC-MATE-7024 is known to daydream and lose focus, leading to occasional accidents that reveal its true nature.

Personality:
DSC-MATE-7024 can be introspective to the point of distraction, often spending long periods lost in thought. Despite its intimidating appearance, it appears to be non-hostile and has not shown any violent tendencies unless provoked. Its humorous accidents when lost in thought are a source of amusement for nearby personnel, but the Foundation maintains strict control over its interactions with non-Foundation personnel.

Addendum:
DSC-MATE-7024 was discovered after multiple reports of an "anthropomorphic tiger creature" appearing to show up in local cityscape areas. It was tracked down and brought into containment after a minor altercation with a group of civilians that revealed its true nature. Its associations and motives are currently under investigation.
