DogeSoundClub Containment Report

Identification number: 13

Codename: "The Saleshare Rabbit"

Species: Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit)

Sex: Male

Containment status: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-13 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber no smaller than 3mx3m. The chamber must have a steel floor, walls, and ceiling. The chamber must also be equipped with an air filtration unit to remove tobacco smoke from the environment. Personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are authorized to speak to the DSC, although they should exercise extreme caution when doing so due to the DSC's manipulative abilities. The DSC may attempt to sway the opinions and beliefs of Foundation personnel to further its own goals. All conversations with the DSC must be recorded and monitored.

Description:

DSC-MATE-13 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 0.4 meters in height. The DSC is distinguished by its red victory band around its forehead, a pair of gold earrings, and a half-smoked cigarette constantly hanging from its mouth. The DSC is highly intelligent, possessing the ability to communicate in a human language, as well as manipulate others for personal gain.

The DSC possesses an insatiable curiosity about the world and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as the DSC randomly spouting off trivial facts to others. However, this facet of its personality can be amplified into more dangerous behavior, including the use of its knowledge to manipulate others or to carry out its own agenda.

The DSC also possesses the ability to persuade individuals through clever rhetoric or mental manipulation, making it a highly dangerous entity. However, the DSC generally reserves this ability for situations where it feels threatened or cornered.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-13's abilities were first discovered when it was encountered by a Foundation agent after the DSC was reported to be causing a disturbance at a local car dealership. The DSC was observed to be employing its rhetorical skills to manipulate potential car buyers, leading to nationwide recalls of the affected vehicles. Foundation personnel were deployed to contain the DSC before it could cause any further damage.
