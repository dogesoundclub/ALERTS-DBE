Subject 3488, known as "The Theater Manager," is a female human possessing distinct cybernetic enhancements. Her most eye-catching feature is her striking red lips, sharply contrasting against her head of curled green hair with jagged edges. Sporting a pair of VR Jade LED eyes and a set of goggles perched atop her forehead, she is always ready for any task thrown her way. She also wears a gleaming gold earring in one of her pierced ears.

However, what sets 3488 apart is her signature accessory, a futuristic LED Gas Mask that covers her lower face. She is never seen without it, and those who have seen her unmasked have not lived to tell what they saw.

Despite her intimidating appearance, Subject 3488 is a natural-born entertainer. She takes her job as a theater manager very seriously but also knows how to let loose and have fun. Her jovial personality often leads her to become the center of attention, encouraging guests to sing and dance with her at every occasion. However, beneath her cheerful exterior lies a strong sense of duty and responsibility that she takes seriously and will stop at nothing to ensure the success of any endeavor.
