Subject 1120 is a human farmer of seemingly average physical build, with an unusual appearance. The subject is characterized by a prominent pattern of spots on their face, further accentuated by their continually frighted mouth. Perhaps the most unusual trait of subject 1120 is their unsettling red clown eyes, which give the viewer an eerie sensation of unease.

Despite this appearance, subject 1120 has demonstrated a great sense of humor, and they gleefully make use of it to entertain and lighten the mood. This has both endeared the subject to their fellow farmers and elicited nods of approval from many of the townspeople. Subject 1120's humorous antics include funny storytelling or doing silly impersonations of figures they admire or fear, but always with a light touch and a wink at their audience.
