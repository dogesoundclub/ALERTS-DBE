DSC Identification number 6202 is a humanoid entity that goes by the name of a Delivery Driver. Do not let its mundane job title deceive you. This human is an enigma of sorts, with peculiar features that make it stand out from the rest. Its face has a distinctive mouth spot that seems disproportionate to its body. The mouth spot is almost always frozen in a mischievous smile, giving the impression that the entity has some secrets it wants to share. Its eyes are always covered by nerd glasses, suggesting a love for technology or a voyeuristic tendency.

The entity's head has an unusual trait that resembles that of a monk. Upon closer examination, the lower half of its head is clean-shaven while the upper half has bald shiny hair that glistens under bright light. Even more intriguing, it dons a red scarf around its neck that anchors its quirky personality. But the most striking feature of the entity is the LED gas mask that it often sports around its face. The mask glows eerily in the dark and changes colors depending on the entity's mood or state of mind.

Despite its peculiar appearance, DSC 6202 is an energetic and enthusiastic individual. It has a contagious aura that makes those around it feel the same euphoria. The entity seems to take great delight in getting others excited about obscure things or events that trigger some sense of humor. It may get overly excited about something that others do not find as interesting, which makes it the subject of some harmless ridicule.

Handle with caution, for the DSC entity 6202 can easily manipulate those around it to bend to its whims.
