DSC-MATE-371 is a villainous rabbit that possesses a number of mesmerizing and quite unnerving physical features. Its ski goggle eyes have a strange hypnotic quality, while its frightened mouth only adds to its otherworldly and disturbing appearance. Its head is a vibrant shade of green and looks as though it has not been arranged or groomed in any particular manner.

However, the most chilling accessory that DSC-MATE-371 possesses is its LED gas mask. This device seems to be linked to the rabbit's ability to emit dangerous and toxic gases that can cause harm to those around it. Care should be taken when handling DSC-MATE-371, as any sudden movements or unexpected noises can trigger the release of these gases.

Despite being a dangerous villain, DSC-MATE-371 possesses a lighthearted and jovial personality. It values harmony and social connections, often engaging in playful banter and telling jokes. This goofier side can lead to humorous situations, though it is important not to let one's guard down around such an unpredictable and potentially deadly character.
