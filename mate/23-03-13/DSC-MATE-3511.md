Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-3511 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber lined with sound-absorbing material to reduce noise disturbances. The containment chamber must be equipped with a state-of-the-art ventilation system capable of providing fresh air and preventing the buildup of dust and debris. In addition, a mechanical alarm system must be installed to alert staff members in the event of an escape attempt.

DSC-MATE-3511 is given access to basic computer systems to carry out repairs and maintenance, but all files must be thoroughly checked before being uploaded to avoid potential data breaches. Physical access to the containment chamber is prohibited, except for authorized personnel, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-3511 must be conducted through a communication system.

DSC-MATE-3511's most characteristic feature is the red scarf they often wear, which they use to clean oil from their paws while working in the Maintenance and Engineering Department. Tasks performed by DSC-MATE-3511 are primarily related to the cleaning and repair operations of Foundation technology, and they specialize in machinery requiring intricate and delicate handling.

DSC-MATE-3511's personality is reflective of their species, often staying on a heightened state of alert and anxiousness.
