DSC-MATE-6550 is a peculiar individual, a human with orange stripes running down his face and a flashy smile that he wears at all times. However, his most defining feature is his striking blue clown eyes that seem to have a hypnotizing effect on those who look into them for too long.

His head is adorned with green hair held together under a purple cap, giving him a playful and carefree appearance.

DSC-MATE-6550 is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck, which he claims is a lucky charm.
