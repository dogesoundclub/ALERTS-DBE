Item #: DSC-MATE-4067

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-4067 is to be kept within a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with surveillance cameras and monitored by security personnel during all times. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter the chamber must be terminated immediately.

DSC-MATE-4067 is allowed to maintain its position as the leader of the local rabbit mafia. However, Foundation agents are to be placed within the mafia to monitor DSC-MATE-4067's activities and to prevent any harm to the civilian population.

DSC-MATE-4067 is permitted to keep its whistle as a personal object, but is not permitted to use it within Foundation containment. The whistle is to be considered a potential anomalous object and has been designated as DSC-MATE-4067-1.

Description:

DSC-MATE-4067 is a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and wears a hoodie, hiding its true age, and medical state. It wears nerd glasses over its eyes and a two-color band across its forehead. Its most notable feature is its deep empathy and understanding for others, which can lead to emotional outbursts and tears when witnessing pain or suffering. DSC-MATE-4067 also has a fondness for animals and nature.

DSC-MATE-4067 holds the position of the leader of the local rabbit mafia, using its empathy and understanding to manipulate and control its members. It has been observed using its whistle to summon its subordinates and to signal attacks on rival factions.

DSC-MATE-4067 has exhibited signs of anomalous behavior, including the ability to communicate with other rabbits and control their movements. However, further investigation is needed to determine the extent of its abilities.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-4067 has proven to be a valuable asset in Foundation operations, providing valuable intelligence and assistance in containing other anomalous entities. Its unique abilities and empathetic nature make it an invaluable resource, and it is recommended that further research be conducted to better understand DSC-MATE-4067's capabilities.
