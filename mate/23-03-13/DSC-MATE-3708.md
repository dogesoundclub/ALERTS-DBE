DSC-MATE-3708, also known as "The Sentinel", is a female human employed as a security guard at Foundation facilities. Upon initial observation, she is noted to possess distinctive facial features, including spots on her cheeks and a warm smile. Her hair is styled in pigtails, accentuating her youthful appearance. 

However, upon closer inspection, her forehead is not devoid of adornments, as she habitually wears a pair of goggles as a headband. This accessory serves as an enforcement of her attitude of being ready to take on any challenge that comes her way. 

Further examination reveals a pair of green cross-shaped earrings dangling from her ears, possibly indicating a religious or symbolic association. She also wears a choker, a fashionable yet potentially weaponized piece of jewelry. 

Her personality is remarkable in that it bears an innate trait of leadership that presents itself in both a professional and personal setting. She carries herself with confidence and determination, becoming an asset in any situation that arises. 

Staff are advised to treat DSC-MATE-3708 with respect and deference, mindful of her keen ability to take charge and maintain order in any situation. Any suggestion of insubordination or insensitivity may result in breaches of security and discipline.
