DSC Identification Number 9059 is a humanoid security guard with peculiar facial features. Her lips are a deep, rich purple that contrast starkly against her fair skin. But it's her eyes that are truly captivating - blood red and ringed with black, they seem almost clownish in nature.

Despite her unusual looks, 9059 is anything but intimidating. In fact, she possesses a great sense of humor and an infectious laugh that can lighten even the grimmest of situations. She is a natural storyteller and can regale others with hilarious tales and silly impersonations for hours on end.

To aid in her guarding duties, 9059 sports a silver chain that dangles menacingly from her belt loop. She's also rarely seen without a lit cigarette in hand, the smoke trailing behind her like a wispy veil.

Overall, while she may appear mysterious and slightly unnerving at first glance, DSC 9059 is a charming and humorous addition to any team.
