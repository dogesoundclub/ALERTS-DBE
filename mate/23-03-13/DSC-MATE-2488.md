**Item #:** 2488

**Object Class:** Humanoid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item #2488 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The room must be fitted with a dedicated ventilation system for the dispersal of any noxious gases that may be produced by Item #2488's performance. All personnel must avoid physical contact with Item #2488 and are to refrain from making eye contact unless specifically authorized by Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** Item #2488 is a male banker who presents with unique facial features, including multiple spots and a clown mouth. Item #2488's eyes are also clown-like in appearance and of a vibrant blue coloration. Item #2488 is distinguished by a mohawk hairstyle and a jade earring in both ears. In addition to their peculiar appearance, Item #2488's personality is noted to be highly jovial and extroverted. They possess a natural talent for humor and can quickly find common ground with almost anyone, reflecting an easygoing nature.

Item #2488's jovial attitude is expressed through their love of comedy, which can be sometimes off-color or inappropriate. They are always eager to entertain and lighten the mood, which is reinforced by their tendency to tell funny stories or do silly impersonations. Despite their immense love for comedy, Item #2488 has shown no evidence of being capable of performing any anomalous or impossible feats. There is no evidence of Item #2488's abilities or personality causing them any significant physical or psychological strain.

**Addendum:** Item #2488 remains a unique specimen in the Foundation's collection. Due to their lack of anomalous ability, Item #2488's containment procedures can be less stringent than that of other humanoid DSCs. However, our lack of understanding of Item #2488's physiology precludes any meaningful conclusions about their potential capabilities. It is, therefore, imperative that we keep an eye on Item #2488 for any changes or signs of abnormal behavior.
