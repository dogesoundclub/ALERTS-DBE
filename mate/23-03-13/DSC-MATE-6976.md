DSC-MATE-6976, codenamed "The Empath," is a human female of approximately 30 years of age. She is a Traffic Officer within the local police department and is often seen patrolling the city streets, sporting a warm smile and a kind demeanor. Her short, witch-like hair frames her face, and she often wears a gold chain and gold earrings.

DSC-MATE-6976 is a highly empathetic individual, possessing a deep understanding of the emotions of those around her. She often feels the pain and suffering of others, which can lead to emotional outbursts and tears. This empathic ability has proven invaluable in her work, allowing her to diffuse tense situations and connect with people on a deep level.

In addition to her empathic ability, DSC-MATE-6976 also has a fondness for animals and nature. She can often be seen feeding stray animals and planting flowers in public spaces. However, her love for smoking cigarettes contradicts her care for nature. Testing shows that her personality is not anomalous, indicating her behavior and emotions are result of natural development.

DSC-MATE-6976's empathic abilities have made her a valuable asset to the Foundation's efforts to track and contain anomalous individuals. However, care must be taken to ensure that she is not overwhelmed by the emotions of those she encounters in the field. Monthly psychiatric evaluations and therapy is recommended to ensure that she remains mentally stable.
