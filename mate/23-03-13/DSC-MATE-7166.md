Subject 7166 is a human female, though one should not be fooled by her mundane facade. As a reporter, she has gained access to information beyond what the average citizen could imagine. Her eyes are shielded by plain glasses, which she often deploys during interviews to hide any tells. 

The subject's head is adorned with short, wiry hair that could easily be mistaken for that of a witch. However, a closer observation of her forehead reveals a peculiar feature - a two-color band that serves as a marker of some foreign origin. 

The subject often flaunts gold earrings, adding a touch of extravagance to her subdued appearance. But do not let her choice of accessory fool you. Rumors suggest that her ears are highly sensitive to supernatural sounds. 

The subject's most common accessory is an ever-present cigarette. This habit serves as a coping mechanism for her intense empathetic tendencies. Her kind and nurturing personality extends not only to people but also inanimate objects. It is said that she is prone to naming her car, talking to plants, or even making her home appliances seem sentient. 

Be wary around Subject 7166, for her seemingly ordinary presence could hold a deeper, more profound secret.
