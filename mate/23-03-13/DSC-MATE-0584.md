DSC-MATE-584, codenamed as "The Pink Rabbit", is a humanoid security guard with a peculiar appearance. Their head notably bears the likeness of a pink rabbit, which contrasts vastly with their human physiology. The rabbit head is adorned with a pair of stunning jade earrings, which serve as a striking accent to their already bizarre image. Despite their unusual appearance, it is advised that staff should not approach them as anything other than a human being.

The Pink Rabbit exhibits a vivid personality, and their independent attitude is a testament to their stubborn and rebellious nature. They are viewed as someone who is often restricted by rules and regulations and tends to rebel against authority. This can manifest in acts of defiance, such as leaving their post early, taking unauthorized sick leaves, and other insubordinate behavior.

Thus far, DSC-MATE-584 has shown no signs of any unusual abilities or anomalies. Their odd appearance, however, may indicate that there is more to them than meets the eye. All information regarding their true nature and origin is classified under Site-███ due to the potential risk that they might pose to the Foundation's containment protocols.

Overall, DSC-MATE-584's distinct appearance and their rebellious tendencies make them an intriguing individual to observe within the confines of the Foundation. As of now, their anomalous properties and capabilities remain unknown, but their role as a security guard makes them a valuable asset to the Foundation. It is recommended that all personnel maintain a professional distance while handling their duties.
