Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-2436 is currently uncontainable due to their occupation as a delivery driver for a well-established parcel company. It is important to note that DSC-MATE-2436 is not aware of their anomalous properties and therefore is not to be approached or studied by Foundation personnel unless under emergency circumstances.

Description:
DSC-MATE-2436 is a male primate, known to the public as a "monkey," with a physical appearance consistent with that of a common delivery driver. DSC-MATE-2436's facial features consist of horned rim glasses, a purple cap adorned with a headset, and a jade earring in each ear.

In addition to these accessories, DSC-MATE-2436 wears a red scarf and can often be seen smoking a cigarette. DSC-MATE-2436's behavior is generally harmless, although they do have a strong sense of independence that sometimes borders on stubbornness.

DSC-MATE-2436's reluctance to ask for help can lead to humorous situations, such as struggling to move a heavy object or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. This trait may also make gathering information about DSC-MATE-2436's anomalous properties difficult.

DSC-MATE-2436's anomalous properties have yet to be fully understood, as they display no overtly paranormal behavior during day-to-day activities. However, further observation has revealed that DSC-MATE-2436 is somehow able to locate and deliver packages with near-perfect efficiency despite having no apparent knowledge of their contents or intended recipients.

It is unclear whether DSC-MATE-2436 is aware of this ability or how they develop it. Foundation personnel are currently investigating means of achieving direct observation of DSC-MATE-2436 without being detected. Until further notice, DSC-MATE-2436 should be considered a moderate security threat to normalcy.
