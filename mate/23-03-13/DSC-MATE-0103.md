DSC-MATE-103, also known as "The Robot Car Salesman", is an anomalous automaton of unknown origin. With its metallic exterior and advanced technological features, DSC-MATE-103 is often mistaken for a futuristic prototype model by those not aware of its true nature.

The most striking feature of DSC-MATE-103 is its iconic Doge hat, which it wears at all times. The hat appears to have no functional purpose and is believed to be there purely for aesthetic reasons. Its red cross earring is another interesting accessory that seems to serve no real function, adding a mysterious element to the enigmatic robot's appearance.

DSC-MATE-103 favors normal glasses for its visual sensors, lending it a semblance of humanity despite its inorganic nature. However, its most notable accessory is the LED gas mask, which appears to be the only representation of any form of self-defense mechanism of the automaton.

Despite its robotic appearance, DSC-MATE-103 possesses a strong sense of responsibility and duty towards its job as a car salesman. It displays an upbeat and humorous personality, often known for getting the party started and getting everyone to dance and sing along to its favorite tunes.

Caution is advised when dealing with DSC-MATE-103, as its true motives and capabilities remain unknown. Mindful of its enigmatic personality and advanced technological abilities, any interaction with DSC-MATE-103 should be approached with caution to avoid any unforeseen incidents.
