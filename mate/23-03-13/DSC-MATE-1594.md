DSC-MATE-1594, codenamed "The Tigress Lawyer," is a male tiger with distinctive markings on his forehead, which have earned him the nickname "two-tone" among the Foundation staff. Despite his imposing appearance, DSC-MATE-1594 often displays a frightened expression on his mouth, which leads many to believe that he suffers from anxiety or is easily startled by sudden movements.

Although DSC-MATE-1594 is a more intuitive leader and often takes charge of situations, he can sometimes come off as a control freak. This trait can be attributed to his natural leadership qualities, which have helped him to hold the prestigious position of a lawyer in a human law firm. It's not unusual for DSC-MATE-1594 to take the role of protector and defender of those he cares about, a behavior that stems from his tiger biology.

DSC-MATE-1594 is particularly fond of fine accessories, including his gold chain, which he often sports during work hours. The Foundation's researchers have observed that DSC-MATE-1594's head fur is not arranged in the typical grayscale pattern of the genus Panthera but is instead a vibrant shade of green. The reason for this anomaly remains unknown.

Personnel who are required to interact with DSC-MATE-1594 are reminded to remain calm and non-threatening. DSC-MATE-1594 won't hesitate to defend itself if it feels attacked or threatened. However, it's also crucial to remember that DSC-MATE-1594 is not evil by nature and can be cooperative with personnel if treated with respect and dignity.
