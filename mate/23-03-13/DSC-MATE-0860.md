Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-860, also known as "The News Anchor," must be kept at all times within a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a single door. The door must have two locking mechanisms, including an electronic key card and traditional locking mechanism. The door must also be reinforced with steel plating and monitored by a CCTV camera at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-860's cell must only be granted with Level 4 clearance.

DSC-MATE-860 is a male tiger standing at 6'4" with a muscular build. He has brown fur with notable black stripes and is often seen wearing a hoodie and glasses. DSC-MATE-860 also has a distinct two-color band on his forehead and wears a silver chain and carries a candy stick as accessories.

DSC-MATE-860 displays practical and hands-on capabilities, often using unconventional methods to solve problems. Careful observation during testing reveals that DSC-MATE-860 has a remarkable command over his environment and appears to have an exceptional understanding of electronic devices. DSC-MATE-860 has displayed an aptitude for hacking and other technological skills, which have caused personnel to keep monitoring him more closely.

DSC-MATE-860 is kept under careful monitoring, as he has demonstrated the capacity to escape from containment multiple times. Because of his mechanical skills, any electrical or mechanical devices in his cell must be monitored by experts to prevent any tampering or reconfiguration by DSC-MATE-860.

The Foundation will continue to monitor DSC-MATE-860 as he poses a unique risk to containment, and his abilities place him in a class of his own. Exercise caution when dealing with DSC-MATE-860, and always follow proper security protocols. Failure to do so can result in severe consequences, as DSC-MATE-860 is known to be independent and unpredictable.
