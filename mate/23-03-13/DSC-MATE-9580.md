Item #: 9580

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 9580 is to be contained in a soundproofed chamber at all times. Interaction with the subject is only allowed with the permission and supervision of Level 3 personnel. It is mandatory for handlers of Subject 9580 to wear noise-cancelling headphones and avoid flashing lights. Any unapproved interaction with the subject can result in immediate termination.

Description:
Subject 9580 is a robotic entity that resembles a farmer. Its red alarm head has the appearance of a classic rooster, and its ski goggle eyes are reminiscent of protective eyewear. It possesses a golden earring and a medical mask covering its mouth. It wears a red scarf around its neck and an extra pair of goggles on its forehead. Subject 9580 exhibits a spontaneous personality that is prone to taking risks and making impulsive decisions.

While in containment, Subject 9580 is docile and non-communicative. However, its unpredictable nature makes it a high-risk entity outside of containment. Based on previous encounters, Subject 9580 is known to exhibit extreme behavior such as jumping off cliffs or precipices, putting both itself and any bystanders in danger. It is unknown what motivates Subject 9580 to engage in such behavior.

It is suspected that Subject 9580 was created by a rogue scientist using illicit technologies. The origin of its programming and the motives behind its creation are still under investigation. Until more information comes to light, Subject 9580 will remain under close observation and isolation from the public eye.

Addendum:
Incident Report - 9580
During a routine maintenance check of the subject's chamber, level 2 personnel unknowingly triggered a loud beep on their equipment, resulting in an abnormal reaction from Subject 9580. The subject began to exhibit extreme violent behavior, rampaging through its chamber and causing significant structural damage to the facility. Level 3 personnel were able to regain control over the subject after neutralizing it with a tranquilizer. It has been recommended that additional safety measures and acoustic dampening be implemented to prevent future breaches.
