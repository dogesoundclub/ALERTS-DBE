Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-2091 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to the chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel with explicit authorization, with a minimum of two armed guards on duty at all times. DSC-MATE-2091 is to be provided with a steady supply of live prey as part of its dietary needs. Any personnel entering DSC-MATE-2091's chamber must wear reinforced body armor to prevent injury.

Description:

DSC-MATE-2091 appears to be a male tiger of the subspecies Panthera tigris tigris, measuring approximately 2.5 meters in length and weighing around 300 kilograms. However, DSC-MATE-2091 displays several anomalous traits that set it apart from its non-anomalous counterparts. Notably, DSC-MATE-2091's eyes are replaced with VR Jade LEDs, which emit a faint glow in low-light situations. DSC-MATE-2091 also wears a medical mask over its mouth and a purple cap on its head, with green hair partially visible. It bears a jade earring on each ear and a red scarf as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-2091 has demonstrated a highly developed intellect for a non-human animal and possesses a natural talent for leadership. It often takes charge in situations, including those within its containment chamber. This behavior is not limited to animal behavior, and DSC-MATE-2091 has displayed an understanding of human language beyond that expected of a beast. Furthermore, DSC-MATE-2091 is capable of flaking telepathic suggestions to humans it is in contact with; these suggestions are reported to feel like a compulsion to obey DSC-MATE-2091's instructions.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2091 is currently employed as a delivery driver for an unnamed company that operates within local city limits. The exact circumstances of DSC-MATE-2091's employment and acquisition by this company remain unknown, and no ties have been found between DSC-MATE-2091's current employer and any known Groups of Interest.

DSC-MATE-2091's employer has shown no direct interaction with DSC-MATE-2091 beyond the issuance of delivery assignments, and all measures to prevent this interaction have been met with limited success.

DSC-MATE-2091 exhibits no signs of distress in its present situation and has presented no risks of breaching containment. Future plans for reintegration into the outside world must be heavily monitored and planned in advance before any actions are undertaken.
