Item #: 2473

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 2473 is to be kept under standard humanoid containment protocols at all times. They are allowed to continue working as a police officer in their designated area, but are to be monitored closely for any signs of anomalous behavior. Any instances of abnormal behavior are to be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities.

Description:

Subject 2473 is a female human with distinctive orange stripes on her face, a bright red clown-like smile, and eyes that appear painted with makeup. The subject's head is not arranged in a traditional hairstyle and instead appears as green strands of hair that are tangled and unkempt. Their forehead features two different colored bands, and they wear a green cross earring on each ear.

The subject is often seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory. They possess a personality that exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but they also enjoy having fun and being the center of attention. They are often found playing music, singing, and dancing, causing humorous situations wherever they go.

It is currently unknown how subject 2473 obtained their anomalous traits or the significance of their appearance. Further research is needed to determine the cause and potential effects of their abilities.

Addendum:

During a routine containment check, subject 2473 exhibited abnormal behavior, which has been noted in their file. No further action has been taken at this time, but modifications to their containment procedures may be necessary in the future.
