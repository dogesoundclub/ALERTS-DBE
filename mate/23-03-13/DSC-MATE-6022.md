Among other articles of interest, DSC-MATE-6022 wears a gold chain and a gas mask, suggesting a deliberate effort to conceal or protect her identity.

DSC-MATE-6022's most notable attribute is her overwhelming sense of empathy, which extends not only to sentient beings but also to inanimate objects. She has been observed personifying various belongings, including her car, plants, and household appliances, suggesting a deep-seated nurturing streak. Such behavior has prompted a debate among DSC personnel regarding the presence of anomalous psychic abilities, though no indications have been found to support this hypothesis.

Despite her endearing nature, DSC-MATE-6022 exhibits a strong sense of protectiveness toward her clients and colleagues.
