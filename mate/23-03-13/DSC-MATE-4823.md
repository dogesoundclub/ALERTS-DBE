DogeSoundClub Containment Breach Warning: Object 4823

Object 4823, also known as "The Tiger Cop", is a male humanoid tiger of unknown origin. His facial features include a frightened mouth, which suggests that he may have experienced traumatic events in the past. He wears a red beanie, jade LED eyes, and a gold earring. An embroidered red scarf acts as a makeshift necktie.

First encountered in a police station in [REDACTED] city, The Tiger Cop has been reported to exhibit a high level of energy and enthusiasm that is uncommon for his species. His contagious spirit could also lead to misinterpretation of his intentions.

DogeSoundClub personnel should exercise caution while interacting with The Tiger Cop, since he may get overly excited and thus, disregard the protocol of Foundation's secret operations.

It has also been reported that during certain circumstances, DSC-MATE-4823 exhibits physical changes, such as increased physical strength and agility, as well as a predator's instinct.

Subject's ultimate goal is yet unknown. As of yet, we are observing and tracking his movements to ensure the protection of innocent civilians.

Object Classification: Safe (due to current status of containment)

Update: Recent surveillance indicates that Object 4823 has joined the Foundation's Urban Fantasy division as a police officer, and has shown high aptitude and enthusiasm for handling supernatural anomalies. His strengths and weaknesses are being evaluated for suitability as a field agent. Future updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
