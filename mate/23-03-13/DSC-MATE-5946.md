DSC-MATE-5946, also known as "The Politician," is a male rabbit with an intense passion for politics. While his nondescript brown fur may lead some to underestimate him, his cunning intelligence and natural charisma have propelled him to the top echelons of the political world, where he has become a shrewd and calculating player in the cutthroat game of city government. 

Always sharply dressed in his retro cap and nerd glasses, The Politician presents a polished image to the public, although his addiction to cigarettes often betrays his true anxieties and inner demons. Though he may appear aloof and distant at first, those who get to know him soon discover a fiercely loyal friend and a fierce protector of his loved ones. 

Beware those who cross his path, however, as The Politician won't hesitate to use his considerable political power to ruin his enemies or to fight for what he sees as an important cause. Whether he's working to pass a new law or just enjoying a quiet night with his friends and a few drinks, The Politician remains an enigmatic and charismatic figure whom nobody can quite figure out.
