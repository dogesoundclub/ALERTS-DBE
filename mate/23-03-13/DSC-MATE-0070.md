DSC-MATE-70, codenamed "Hare Doctor", is a highly charismatic and empathetic individual, displaying a remarkable aptitude for connecting with others on a deep, personal level. Despite being of the rabbit species, Hare Doctor exudes an air of self-assurance and confidence, which is further accentuated by his love for wearing nerd glasses.

Often seen sporting a silver chain around his neck, this accessory serves as a constant reminder of his dedication to aiding those in need. His whistle, usually seen dangling from his belt, is employed as a means of summoning and communing with a menagerie of nearby creatures.

As a veterinarian, Hare Doctor demonstrates an incredible amount of skill and care when it comes to treating ailing beasts, which has earned him a level of respect and admiration among both humans and animals alike.

Despite his life-saving expertise, Hare Doctor never takes himself too seriously, using his humor to break the ice and endear himself to the masses. Though some DSC agents may find his quirkiness off-putting, there is no denying that the positivity and good vibes that follow in his wake can prove invaluable in a world full of darkness and danger.
