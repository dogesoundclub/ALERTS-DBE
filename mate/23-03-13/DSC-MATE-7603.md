Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 7603 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. The containment area is to be monitored by a surveillance team at all times. Proper safety protocols must be followed when interacting with the subject, as they are known to possess a dangerous LED gas mask accessory that may release hazardous substances.

Description:

Subject 7603 is a human female that appears to be in her mid-thirties. The subject possesses several distinctive physical features, including 90s brown hair and green cross earrings. Subject 7603 has facial spots and a goggle on their forehead at all times, which is believed to aid in vision.

Despite being human, Subject 7603 has a unique personality that sets them apart from most people. They exhibit a natural talent for leadership and are often seen taking charge of situations, whether it be work-related or in their personal life. It is unclear if this ability is a result of their profession as a veterinarian.

Subject 7603's most notable accessory is the LED gas mask that they wear at all times. The purpose of the mask is unknown, but it is believed to be highly dangerous and capable of releasing harmful substances. It is suspected that the item is of anomalous origin and may have been acquired by the subject during their travels.

Addendum:

Subject 7603 has recently shown signs of increased hostility and aggression towards staff members. Due to their unpredictable nature, proper safety precautions must be taken when interacting with the subject. Further evaluation is required to determine whether or not stronger containment measures are necessary.
