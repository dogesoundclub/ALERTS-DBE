Description: The Doctor appears to be a typical human male, with the exception of the peculiar features on his face. His frightened expression and ski goggle eyes create a disconcerting appearance. The Doctor is commonly seen wearing a retro cap and a jade earring in his left ear, with a gold chain and cigarette as accessories.
