DSC-MATE-7385, also known as "The Charismatic Fashion Designer", is a human female with distinctive face features. Her lips are constantly painted in a vibrant red color, which draws attention to her words whenever she speaks. Her eyebrows match the same orange hue, that seem to match the flames of her humor. She is always seen sporting a stylish orange side-haircut, and her ears pierced with intricate red cross earrings that complement her choker necklace. In addition to her fashion taste, she also wears a standard gas mask, which she claims is for limiting distractions.

Despite her eccentric appearances, DSC-MATE-7385 may appear as an individual with superficial qualities, but her true nature is revealed through her ability to draw crowds and bring joy to her surroundings. Her natural charm, combined with her extroverted approach, can make her the life of any party while putting a smile on everyone's faces. It is said that she even uses her charisma as a creative source of inspiration, often incorporating humor and dance moves to her unique fashion designs.

DSC-MATE-7385's personality traits make her an asset to the Foundation's urban fantasy division, where she uses her fashion talents and social intelligence to blend into the supernatural community to gather essential information. Her fashion designer job also grants her access to various fashion events and influential circles, which she uses to gather further intel.

The Foundation must keep DSC-MATE-7385's abilities contained, as a combination of her charming personality and fashion design skills can make her the ultimate weapon for any opposing dispositions. Until further research or containment is established, she must be kept under close observation and provided with necessary accommodations to continue her work efficiently.
