Subject 888, codenamed "The Purple-Lipped Officer," is a member of the urban fantasy police force, tasked with keeping the supernatural elements of the city in check.

At first glance, Agent 888 appears to be a typical human female, with her purple lips being her most distinctive feature. However, upon closer inspection, it is revealed that her head is abnormally orange on one side, leading many to speculate that she may have been exposed to some sort of magical radiation.

Despite her unusual appearance, Agent 888 is a consummate professional, well-respected among her peers for her reliability and organizational skills. However, her stubborn streak can sometimes lead her to clash with authority figures or make impulsive decisions in the heat of the moment.

Agent 888 is rarely seen without her signature silver chain, which is rumored to be enchanted with some sort of mystical power. She is also known to be a heavy smoker, often seen puffing on a cigarette during stakeouts or interrogations.

Overall, while Agent 888 may be a bit eccentric, her devotion to duty and her unwavering commitment to justice make her a vital asset to the supernatural community.
