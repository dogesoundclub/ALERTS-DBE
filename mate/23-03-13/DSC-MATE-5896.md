DSC-MATE-5896, codenamed the Compassionate Courier, is a delivery driver of simian descent. His head, unusual for his species, is parted pink instead of the typical dark fur. Despite his animal origins, he displays an uncommon degree of empathy and understanding towards his human counterparts. His personality is defined by a deep desire to help others, which can lead to him taking on more than he can handle. DSC-MATE-5896 is prone to feeling responsible for the well-being of those around him, often putting their needs before his own. While commendable, this behavior can be a cause for concern and requires close monitoring. As part of the Foundation's efforts to integrate anomalous creatures into society, DSC-MATE-5896 has been assigned to a delivery role where his helpful nature can be put to good use.
