DSC-MATE-1068, also known as "The Dealer," is a human female in the profession of car sales. Despite her mundane job, she stands out due to her striking green hair, purple cap, and jade earrings that seem to glow with an otherworldly light. Along with her gold chain, she never fails to accessorize with her trusty gas mask, which she claims is for health reasons.

Despite her mundane appearance, The Dealer possesses a sharp wit and a knack for analyzing situations. She is known for her logical thinking and tendency towards dry humor, often making clever observations and teasing her friends in a deadpan manner. However, there is an air of mystery surrounding her, as if she knows more than she's letting on. Her analytical mind and quirky sense of humor may make her seem harmless, but those who underestimate her do so at their own peril.
