Item #: 8503

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8503 is to be contained in a reinforced steel chamber at all times. Any human interaction with SCP-8503 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-8503 appears to be a fully functioning humanoid robot in the form of a politician. The entity presents a bucket hat for headwear accessorized with sturdy, stylish glasses â€“ which function as regular human glasses. SCP-8503 bears a single cyclops eye: vibrant green and luminescent. The entity stands at 1.8 meters in height, adorned in a three-piece suit and a gold chain around its neck. One notable detail of SCP-8503 calls upon the golden earring it dons on its left ear.

SCP-8503 is generally sentient, though it does not possess emotional attributes as humans do. Despite this, it demonstrates a distinctive persona that infuses its interactions with people. The entity has a strong sense of independence that often causes episodic conflict with its handlers. Despite its mechanical make-up, SCP-8503 seems to possess a sense of humor, which it displays during the arduous task of self-handling. These attempts may range from attempting to lift large objects to navigating without the use of readily available resources. SCP-8503, under normal circumstances, does not seek assistance from humans, even in situations where it may be mandatory.

Addendum: SCP-8503's true purpose is still unclear. However, its political demeanor and exceptional decision-making abilities make it a valuable asset in the field of diplomacy. The exact capabilities of the cyclops eye are yet to be determined, limiting it to be a possible threat under unforeseen circumstances. SCP-8503 is not allowed out of containment for any reason without the full acknowledgement and supervision of officials.
