Item #: 7861

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7861 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reliable food source and ample opportunities for social interaction. All interactions with SCP-7861 should be monitored for signs of aggression or extreme idealism. Access to outside media outlets should be limited in order to prevent SCP-7861 from inciting any mass protest movements.

Description: SCP-7861 appears to be a male monkey, referred to in its previous life as "Timmy," who now serves as a news anchor for a major television network. SCP-7861 wears a golden chain around its neck and a bucket hat on its head, further accessorized by LED lights that can shift between a rainbow of colors. Its most notable feature is its constantly frightened mouth.

SCP-7861's behavior tends to be extremely idealistic, often to the point of being comical. It is prone to boycotting companies it finds offensive and organizing protests against social injustices. Its idealism often causes it to take extreme measures, which could be seen as threatening in certain contexts. SCP-7861 appears to have a strong desire to make the world a better place and has shown no sign of cooperating with those who do not share its beliefs.

SCP-7861's true nature and origin are currently unknown. The Foundation is still investigating the circumstances under which it acquired the ability to speak and gained access to a high profile news anchor position.

Addendum: It has come to the Foundation's attention that SCP-7861's on-air personas may have the potential to incite large-scale protests against the Foundation itself. All efforts should be made to prevent such an event. Engagements with SCP-7861 should be limited, and its access to media should be surveilled at all times.
