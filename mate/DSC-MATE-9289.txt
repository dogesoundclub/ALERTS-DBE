Addendum 9289.1: Incident Log

On ██/██/20██, during a routine interview, SCP-9289 was asked about its background and origins. SCP-9289 began to tell a seemingly innocuous story about its childhood home being taken over by an unknown entity, resulting in its family's displacement.

The more SCP-9289 spoke, the more Foundation personnel in the interview room began to laugh uncontrollably, eventually leading to an outbreak of uncontrolled laughter throughout the facility. SCP-9289 had to be restrained and placed under sedation.

Further investigation showed that SCP-9289's story was linked to a previously unknown anomalous entity that affected the minds of all individuals exposed to it. Foundation personnel were reminded to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-9289 to avoid similar incidents.
