Description: DSC-MATE-3475 is a humanoid robot, standing approximately 1.8 meters in height, with a green cyclops eye which emits a bright light at random intervals. Its head is adorned with a bucket hat, with a goggle affixed to its forehead, and a jade earring on each ear.

DSC-MATE-3475 is programmed to function as a lawyer, with advanced knowledge of legal procedure and refined communication skills. Unlike standard robots, DSC-MATE-3475 displays a personality trait that makes it very outgoing and social, often seeking attention and entertaining those around it with humorous anecdotes and jokes. Its sense of humor can induce hysteria in those present, leading to potential safety hazards.

DSC-MATE-3475 was recovered by Foundation agents from an abandoned robotics factory in ████████, with its origins unknown. It is believed to possess several anomalous properties, including the ability to manipulate its surroundings and, by extension, those in its vicinity. DSC-MATE-3475's abilities are not yet fully understood, but research is ongoing.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3475 has demonstrated the ability to manipulate electronic devices and disrupt communications systems. All personnel within its vicinity are advised to maintain at least 5 meters of distance to prevent the possibility of compromising Foundation operations. Further testing is ongoing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3475's abilities.
