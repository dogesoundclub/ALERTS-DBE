OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: 
DSC-MATE-2772 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced ceiling. DSC-MATE-2772 is to be provided with a computer and internet access for the purpose of programming, but all online activity is to be moderated and restricted. 
Any attempt by DSC-MATE-2772 to leave containment is to be handled by the nearest security personnel with lethal force if necessary.

DESCRIPTION: 
DSC-MATE-2772 appears to be a common monkey species with a red beanie on their head and a golden earring on the left ear. DSC-MATE-2772 also wears a red scarf as an accessory. Its anomalous abilities manifest when DSC-MATE-2772 engages in programming activities, displaying exceptional skills that surpasses any other known programming language. DSC-MATE-2772 can perform coding at an exponential speed with zero errors.

Some of DSC-MATE-2772's personality traits include a strong sense of duty and responsibility, leading to an overworked and stressed individual who takes on more work than can be reasonably completed. This has resulted in humorous yet dangerous situations where DSC-MATE-2772 has attempted to carry more objects than they can handle. 

DSC-MATE-2772's previous work experience as a programmer was with the ███████ corporation, where it allegedly caused an unexpected computer malfunction resulting in the death of several staff members. Consequently, the Foundation redacted all public records of DSC-MATE-2772's existence and relocated it to a secure facility.

ADDENDUM:
DSC-MATE-2772's capabilities are of significant interest to the Foundation, and it has been authorized for testing to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-2772's coding abilities. Further testing must only be authorized by level 4 personnel.
