Item #: SCP-2691

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2691 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. The chamber must be furnished with a workbench and tools for basic mechanic tasks. Security personnel are to accompany SCP-2691 at all times when outside of its chamber for safety purposes.

SCP-2691's diet is to consist of a specialized rabbit feed diet formulated by Site-██'s medical department. SCP-2691 is to be monitored for any attempts at escape or unauthorized interaction with Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-2691 is a male rabbit standing approximately 1.2 meters tall on its hind legs. Its most distinguishing features are its blue clown eyes, jade earring, and bucket hat. SCP-2691 typically wears a gold chain, which it asserts is good luck.

SCP-2691 is capable of human-level intelligence and possesses an aptitude for mechanical tasks, particularly in the automotive industry. It has been observed to take apart and reassemble complex engines with great precision, much to the amazement of Site-██'s engineers.

SCP-2691's personality is characterized by a scatterbrained nature, which often leads to forgotten appointments and getting sidetracked. It is generally friendly and cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become agitated if separated from its tools or workbench for extended periods.

Addendum: SCP-2691 was recovered by Foundation agents in a garage in ████████, where it had been employed as a mechanic for an underground street racing ring. Upon capture, SCP-2691 was observed to have a tattoo of a lightning bolt on its left forearm, which it has refused to explain. Further investigation is ongoing.
