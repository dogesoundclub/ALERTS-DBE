Addendum 3066-01: DSC-MATE-3066’s Delivery Log

DSC-MATE-3066’s previous employment was as a delivery driver for a courier company in ████████. DSC-MATE-3066’s delivery log catalogues several unusual and potentially anomalous packages, including but not limited to:

- A package containing a metallic cube emitting a low humming sound. The recipient claimed it was a “power source” for an invention.
- A package containing a sprig of exotic, neon-purple flowers that appeared to glow in the dark. The sender requested anonymity.
- A package delivered to a sealed-off room in a government building, with no recorded recipient or sender information.

All packages were delivered without incident, and DSC-MATE-3066 did not indicate any unusual perceptions of the packages or their contents. Following DSC-MATE-3066’s containment, the courier company expressed no knowledge or involvement in the delivery of anomalous packages. Investigation into the source of these packages is ongoing.
