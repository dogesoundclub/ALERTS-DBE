Item #: DSC-MATE-9498

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9498 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. She is allowed one hour of supervised socialization per day with a designated staff member. DSC-MATE-9498 is permitted to have her bucket hat and silver chain in her possession, but all other belongings must be submitted for inspection before being returned to DSC-MATE-9498.

Description: DSC-MATE-9498 is a 29-year-old female fashion designer of human origin. She is characterized by her bright orange stripes and blue clown eyes, which seem to be a manifestation of anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-9498 is generally upbeat and extroverted, but has been noted to exhibit signs of irritability and insecurity when her designs and creations are not well-received.

DSC-MATE-9498 is adept at strategic thinking and has excellent organizational skills. She is also highly ambitious and goal-oriented, often taking on more than she can handle in pursuit of her creative vision. These traits can be both beneficial and detrimental to her work, as she often becomes overwhelmed and stressed under pressure.

Forensic analysis of DSC-MATE-9498's clothing and personal items has revealed traces of anomalous residue, but attempts to determine the source of these anomalies have proven ineffective. It is suspected that DSC-MATE-9498 possesses some form of reality-bending abilities, but further testing is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9498 has expressed an interest in designing clothing for DogeSoundClub personnel. This request is pending approval from Site-██ administration.
