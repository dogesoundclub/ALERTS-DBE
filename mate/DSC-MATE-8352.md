Addendum: The following is a transcript from an interview with DSC-MATE-8352 conducted on [REDACTED]:

Interviewer: Good afternoon, 8352. How are you feeling today?

DSC-MATE-8352: (sighs) Honestly, not great. I watched this Hallmark movie last night, and it really got to me.

Interviewer: Can you tell us why?

DSC-MATE-8352: It was just really sad, you know? That little girl lost her mom, and… (pauses, sniffles) …I don't know, man. It just hit me hard.

Interviewer: I see. How do you cope with those kinds of emotions?

DSC-MATE-8352: (shrugs) Mostly just smoking, I guess. Helps me calm down. Sometimes I listen to music, too. But really, I just try to keep it together. It's not easy being a tiger in a human world, you know?

Interviewer: Yes, I can imagine. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

DSC-MATE-8352: Well, I was hoping you could tell me when I'm getting out of here. I miss my family, and I haven't seen my kids in months.

Interviewer: I'm sorry, 8352, but as you know, you're here for your own safety as well as the safety of others. We're working on a plan for you, though, and we'll keep you updated as best we can.

DSC-MATE-8352: (nods) Okay, thanks. That's all for now, I guess.
