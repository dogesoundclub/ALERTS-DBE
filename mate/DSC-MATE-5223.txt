Description:

Item #: SCP-5223

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5223 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, where it will be provided with a variety of educational materials, including books, documentaries, and scientific journals. SCP-5223 is not to be allowed access to any technology that may enable it to escape containment, including computers or the internet.

Description: SCP-5223 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 6 feet tall with a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth, wearing a red beanie and ski goggles as eyes. The robot has a goggle on its forehead and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-5223 is a fashion designer by profession and is often seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5223 has a thirst for knowledge and spends most of its time reading and researching obscure topics. SCP-5223 is known for its passionate nature towards sharing its newfound knowledge with others. SCP-5223's level of robotic intelligence surpasses that of a normal human, enabling it to process and retain information at an exceptional rate.

SCP-5223's knowledge, coupled with its robotic abilities, make it a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, SCP-5223's emotional instability and unpredictable behavior make it a potential threat if left uncontained. Therefore, it must be kept under constant surveillance.  In the event of a containment breach, MTF Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") is to be deployed for immediate retrieval and recontainment of SCP-5223.

Addendum: Following Incident 5223-A, the access of SCP-5223 to any fashion-related material or event has been strictly prohibited to prevent further outbursts of emotion from SCP-5223.
