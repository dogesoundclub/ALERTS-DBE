Item #: SCP-1680

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-1680 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with no less than two armed guards at all times. The subject is permitted to have one red scarf and one cigarette as personal belongings. Any attempts to remove the scarf or cigarette from the subject must be immediately reported to Level 3 personnel.

Description:

SCP-1680 is a male primate of the monkey species, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. The subject's face is characterized by a permanently frightened mouth and red clown eyes, which emit a powerful hypnotic effect when gazed into directly. SCP-1680's forehead is marked with a two-color band, suggesting the subject's membership within a social group.

The subject is employed as a fast food worker and takes his job with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. SCP-1680 has shown a willingness to work without breaks for extended periods of time, and its output is consistently of high quality.

Despite the subject's intense work ethic, SCP-1680 has also been known to let loose and have fun. The subject enjoys dancing and may surprise others with its moves during social events. SCP-1680's silly behavior has been known to cause laughter in otherwise serious situations.

Addendum:

SCP-1680 was initially discovered following reports of a fast food worker hypnotizing customers with its red clown eyes. Foundation personnel witnessed the subject using its anomalous properties to influence customers into consuming unhealthy amounts of fast food. Class C amnestics were administered to affected individuals and SCP-1680 was contained without incident. All references to SCP-1680's fast food establishment were removed from local directories.
