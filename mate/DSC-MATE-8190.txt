Item #: SCP-8190

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8190 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a train engine simulator. The chamber will be secured by no less than two armed guards round the clock. SCP-8190 is to be given a train schedule to follow every day to help improve focus and reduce distraction. Any deviation from the schedule is to be immediately reported to the on-duty Site Director.

Description: SCP-8190 is a male rabbit with distinctive red clown eyes that emit an unknown energy field. The subject dons a red beanie and a pair of goggles on the forehead as well as a jade earring on the right ear. SCP-8190 also wears a gold chain around the neck and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-8190's personality is that of a distractible individual who has an affinity for trains. The subject is often forgetful and easily sidetracked, which can result in humorous or problematic situations. Despite this, SCP-8190 functions quite well as a train driver, thanks to its keen sense of direction and reflexes.

SCP-8190's red clown eyes emit an unknown radiation that manifests as a spatial distortion. The spatial distortion causes time dilation and severe displacement within a 50-meter radius from SCP-8190. This makes containment and observation of SCP-8190 difficult.

Addendum: It was reported that SCP-8190 derailed a train at high speeds as a result of its forgetful nature, resulting in a significant loss of lives. SCP-8190 claimed not to recall the event, but footage from the train's black box confirmed SCP-8190's involvement. SCP-8190 is to be constantly monitored to avoid a reoccurrence of the event.
