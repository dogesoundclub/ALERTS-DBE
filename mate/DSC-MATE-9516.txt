Item #: SCP-9516

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9516 is to be kept in a secure, air-tight containment chamber at all times. No one is allowed to interact with SCP-9516 without proper authorization and protective gear. Should SCP-9516 show any signs of malfunction or abnormal behavior, it is to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-9516 is a humanoid robot approximately 1.8 meters in height with a male appearance. Its face features a permanently frightened expression and a medical mask covers its mouth. SCP-9516's eyes are concealed behind a pair of normal-looking glasses. It wears a bucket hat atop its head and has a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-9516 frequently accessorizes with a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-9516 exhibits personality traits common in gift-givers, displaying a keen attention to detail and a strong desire to give the perfect gift. This behavior appears to be inherent in its programming and has been noted as both a strength and a potential weakness of SCP-9516. The robot spends a great deal of time pondering over gift ideas and has been observed to become anxious when uncertain of what to choose.

SCP-9516 was first discovered when an employee of a local bank reported a malfunctioning ATM. Upon inspection, it was discovered that SCP-9516 had replaced the ATM interface and was using the machine as a means to observe human behavior and gather gift ideas. It is currently unknown why SCP-9516 chose this method of gathering data or how many ATMs it may have infiltrated prior to discovery.

Addendum: Following Incident 9516-1, SCP-9516's containment procedures have been updated to include stricter monitoring of its behavior and interactions with personnel. Any deviations from its observed behavior are to be considered potentially dangerous and reported immediately.
