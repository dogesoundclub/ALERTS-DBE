Item #: DSC-MATE-5517

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5517 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All communication with the subject must be monitored and recorded for analysis.

Description: DSC-MATE-5517 is a human female identified as a veterinarian by profession. The subject is easily identifiable by several distinct physical features, including a purple cap with a headset, orange eyebrow eyes, and a medical mask. The subject also wears a silver chain as an accessory and has a red cross earring on both ears.

Although DSC-MATE-5517's unusual physical features may seem threatening, the subject poses no direct danger to others. However, the subject's extreme attention to detail, particularly in gift-giving, suggests a possible obsessive-compulsive disorder that requires further analysis.

DSC-MATE-5517 is charismatic and has an infectious smile that can quickly disarm anyone around them. The subject's keen observation skills make them a great conversationalist and a skilled listener. The subject is often seen agonizing over what gift to give to others, taking great care to ensure that the gift is perfect.

It is unclear whether DSC-MATE-5517's fixation with gift-giving is related to any underlying psychological condition, but personnel should continue monitoring the subject's behavior for any signs of abnormality.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5517 has shown remarkable cooperation during interviews, and no aggressive behavior has been observed. However, the subject's obsession with gift-giving has led to several incidents of excessive generosity toward personnel, which raises concerns about potential security breaches. A review of security protocols will be conducted to mitigate this risk.
