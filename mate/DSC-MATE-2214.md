The subject also wears a choker as an accessory.

Personality-wise, Subject 2214 presents as highly analytical and logical, often addressing issues in a professional manner.

Despite their peculiar nature, Subject 2214 has shown to be cooperative with personnel assigned to their case.

Addendum: Subject 2214 was discovered working as a fast-food worker in a local restaurant. No attempts to conceal their anomalous features were made. Authorities were alerted after patrons became increasingly uncomfortable with the subject's appearance and behavior. Following an evaluation, it was determined that the subject's peculiar nature posed no immediate threat to human life.
