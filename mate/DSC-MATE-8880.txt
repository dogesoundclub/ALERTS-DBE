Addendum: Interview Log-8880-01

SCP-8880 was interviewed to gain further insight into her abilities and how she came to develop them.

Interviewer: Dr. ██████

Dr. ██████: SCP-8880, can you tell me about your upbringing and how you came to be a fashion designer?

SCP-8880: Sure, I grew up in a small town where there wasn't much to do. To pass the time, I would create my own outfits out of whatever I could find. I always had a knack for finding fabrics that made me feel a certain way.

Dr. ██████: And when did you realize you had the ability to manipulate emotions with your clothing designs?

SCP-8880: It wasn't until I moved to the city and started selling my designs that I noticed the effect they had on people. I would see someone wearing my clothes and notice that they were sad or angry, and suddenly they would start crying. That's when I knew I had something special.

Dr. ██████: How did you learn to control your abilities?

SCP-8880: It's just something that comes naturally to me. I can sense emotions and know which fabrics and designs will evoke a certain feeling. I've never really thought too much about it.

Dr. ██████: Do you feel any remorse for the emotional impact your designs have on others?

SCP-8880: Of course. It's not my intention to hurt anyone, but I can't help the way people feel when they wear my clothes. I just hope that my designs can help people to connect with their emotions in a positive way.

End log.
