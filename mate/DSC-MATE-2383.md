Item #: 2383

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2383 is to be monitored at all times through a combination of on-site surveillance, hidden cameras, and wiretapping. Unless absolutely necessary, no personnel are to interact with 2383 directly. In cases where direct interaction is necessary, personnel are to wear full biohazard suits to protect themselves from potential infection.

Description: Subject 2383 is a human female of average height and weight with a noticeable pink rabbit head and an electronic VR Rainbow LED as eyes. Her ears are adorned with cross-shaped green earrings, and her mouth is always covered by a medical mask. She often wears a gold chain accessory.

2383 is a banker by profession and is known to be absent-minded and forgetful, particularly when caught up in a project or lost in thought. This has led to her missing important appointments and events, causing her to become the subject of ridicule among her peers.

It is believed that 2383's electronic eyes are capable of transmitting visual signals and can potentially infect viewers with an unknown virus. No known cure or vaccine exists for this virus, and infected individuals have shown varied and unpredictable symptoms such as hallucinations, delirium, and severe headaches.

Further research into 2383's origins and capabilities is ongoing, with the ultimate goal of understanding and containing this anomalous entity.
