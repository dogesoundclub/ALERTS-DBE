Item #: 62

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 62 is to be monitored at all times while they are on air, and any abnormal behavior is to be reported immediately to Foundation personnel. As they may have psychic abilities, they must be closely watched for any possible security breaches or attempts at communication with unknown entities. Subject 62 is to undergo routine psychological evaluations to ensure that their mental state remains stable.

Description: Subject 62 is a human female with bright blue clown eyes that have been the subject of much speculation. Their hair is styled in pig tails, giving them a youthful appearance that is at odds with their professional demeanor as a news anchor. Their forehead is adorned with a two-color band, and they sport a green cross earring on one of their ears.

Personality: Subject 62 has demonstrated a remarkable sense of intuition that has prompted speculation about possible psychic abilities. They have accurately predicted future events and have displayed the ability to sense emotional states in others. This unusual ability can be both impressive and disconcerting, and as a result, they have had problems forming social relationships with others. While their ability can be useful for predicting potential threats to the Foundation, their personality may make them difficult to trust.

Addendum: The possible use of amnestics should be considered in the event that Subject 62's abilities become a threat to Foundation security.
