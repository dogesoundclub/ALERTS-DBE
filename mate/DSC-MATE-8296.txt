Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 8296 is to be kept under constant surveillance at all times due to her influential position in the political realm.

Description:
Subject 8296 is a human woman with distinct facial features. Her face features bright orange stripes and a red lip that seems to accentuate her blue clown-like eyes. Her hair is styled in pig tails, and she is often seen wearing an unusual red cross earring along with a gold chain. However, the most distinct feature of the subject is the LED gas mask she wears over her face, which covers her mouth and nose.

The subject's personality is erratic, and she is known for her indulgence in brainstorming and creative problem solving. This often leads to her proposing odd or outlandish solutions to issues before her or others, much to the amusement and confusion of those around her.

Due to her involvement in politics, it is believed that the subject may have access to sensitive information, and her anomalous nature has made her a target for various groups who aim to capitalize on her abilities.

As of current, little is known about the origin of Subject 8296 or how she acquired her anomalous traits, and further research is necessary to understand and contain her effectively.
