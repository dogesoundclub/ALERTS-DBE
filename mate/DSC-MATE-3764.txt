DESCRIPTION:

SCP-3764, also known as "The Theater Manager," is a male humanoid of the human species. SCP-3764 has orange stripes running down the sides of their face, giving the appearance of tribal war paint. The mouth of SCP-3764 is perpetually stuck in a frightened expression, and their cybernetic eyes are a bright VR Jade LED that glow softly in low-light conditions.

SCP-3764's head is metallic purple and it has a goggle attached to the forehead. The accessory is never worn, but appears to be for aesthetic purposes. SCP-3764 can often be seen with a cigarette in hand, but never appears to smoke it.

SCP-3764 exudes a no-nonsense attitude, indicative of their managerial position, but also has a playful side that can often lead to humorous situations. SCP-3764 values tradition and is known to tell jokes and stories passed down through their family or community.

It is recommended that all personnel interacting with SCP-3764 respect their position as a theater manager and treat them with the utmost professionalism. SCP-3764 has not demonstrated any anomalous abilities or traits, but as with all SCPs, caution and observation are advised.
