Item #: SCP-837

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-837 is to be monitored at all times and is to be kept in an individual cell at Site-██. Any interactions with SCP-837 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-837 is a human male with striking orange stripes on his face and a perpetual smile. His eyes are red and resemble clown eyes. He possesses typical human physical features, with blond hair and distinctive green cross earrings on his ears. SCP-837 is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-837’s most notable attribute is his strong sense of empathy. He is highly attuned to the emotions of others and is often able to offer support or a humorous perspective in difficult situations. It is unclear if SCP-837’s empathy is a result of his anomalous properties or if it is a natural trait.

SCP-837’s career as a firefighter adds to his exceptional perception and demeanor. His ability to work well under pressure has aided him in the handling of potentially dangerous situations.

SCP-837 remains cooperative and friendly towards Foundation personnel, and shows no signs of hostility or abnormal behavior. However, his anomalous properties make him unpredictable and require close monitoring.

Addendum: During a routine psychological evaluation, SCP-837 revealed that he has no memory of how he obtained his anomalous properties. SCP-837 claims to have had them for as long as he can remember. Further investigation is required to determine the origin of SCP-837’s anomalous properties.
