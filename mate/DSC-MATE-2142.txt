Item #: SCP-2142

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2142 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber. Housing should include a hammock for rest and plenty of environmental enrichment to keep SCP-2142 engaged and stimulated. Any interactions with SCP-2142 should be overseen by a trained security guard, as SCP-2142 has been known to engage in prankster behavior at inappropriate times.

Description: SCP-2142 is a male monkey belonging to the genus Macaca. SCP-2142 stands at approximately 80cm in height and weighs 10kg. SCP-2142's most notable features are its pair of horn-rimmed glasses and the blue bandana that it wears around its head. SCP-2142 has demonstrated the ability to communicate using sign language and has a vocabulary of approximately 200 signs. SCP-2142 also possesses a dry sense of humor, often delivering quips and jokes with a deadpan expression that can catch people off guard.

SCP-2142 is a skilled mimic and has demonstrated the ability to imitate human speech to a limited extent. SCP-2142 is generally docile and non-aggressive, but can become mischievous if left unsupervised for too long. SCP-2142 has been observed engaging in pranks and practical jokes, including hiding objects, unravelling shoelaces, and mimicking staff members.

It should be noted that SCP-2142 is highly intelligent and requires frequent mental stimulation to avoid boredom. In the absence of enrichment, SCP-2142 has been known to engage in destructive behavior, such as tearing up books or furniture. As such, it is recommended that SCP-2142 be given access to puzzles, toys, and other forms of mental stimulation on a regular basis.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-2142 escaped from containment after managing to pick the lock on its enclosure. SCP-2142 was found several hours later in the break room, having raided the snack cupboard and helping itself to a variety of treats. Containment procedures have since been updated to include additional locks and security measures.
