SCP Foundation Description:

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-9921 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with basic amenities but devoid of any reading or research materials. Any attempt to provide SCP-9921 with access to educational materials, including books or internet, is strictly prohibited. In addition, all interactions with SCP-9921 must be conducted through video monitoring equipment to ensure the safety of personnel.

Description:

SCP-9921 appears to be a humanoid male, with distinctive spots on his facial features which make him easily identifiable. Most notably, SCP-9921 wears a Doge hat and a medical mask, making it difficult to observe most of his facial expressions. The creature possesses unique blue clown eyes that give off a deceiving look. 

SCP-9921 displays a strong thirst for knowledge and has an insatiable desire to learn about obscure topics. The creature often claims to specialize in various fields, ranging from rare insects to obscure literature. SCP-9921 may become aggressive, and these tendencies tend to manifest when denied access to educational materials. SCP-9921 is prone to boastfulness and enjoys sharing knowledge with others, even if the other person does not have an interest.

SCP-9921 is entirely human, and there is no observed evidence of any anomalous capabilities, making its identification number significant. Still, the foundation decided to classify him as he seems to enjoy causing chaos or acts of villainy. 

Additional Notes:

SCP-9921 has repeatedly attempted to escape containment in search of new knowledge, including attacking personnel or scientists. Extreme caution is advised when handling SCP-9921. Personnel are reminded to maintain honesty and transparency in any interactions with the creature, as SCP-9921 appears to be particularly attentive to these traits.
