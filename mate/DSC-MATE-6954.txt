Item #: 6954

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6954 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Due to her largely passive nature, no stringent protocols are necessary. However, all personnel entering her containment area must do so wearing standard-issue medical masks.

Description: SCP-6954 appears to be a female humanoid of average build, standing at approximately 5'5" in height. Her most noticeable features are orange stripes on her cheeks, a bucket hat on her head, and red cross earrings she wears on her ears. She always wears a medical mask over her mouth and a choker around her neck. The most unusual feature she has is a pair of goggles worn around her forehead.

SCP-6954 often appears lost in thought or daydreaming, which can lead to comedic incidents such as tripping over obstacles or walking into poles. She is highly introverted and prefers to spend time alone, engaging in activities such as reading, writing or programming.

SCP-6954's abilities have not been observed in action; however, she has exhibited a strong aptitude for programming and seemingly has a keen analytical mind. It is possible that her unique physical features may be related to her abilities, though this remains unconfirmed.

Addendum: SCP-6954 has requested to be allowed to continue her programming activities while in containment. This request has been granted with the caveat that all devices with internet access will have the TCP/IP protocols disabled, and that SCP-6954 will only be granted access to machines pre-approved by foundation officials.
