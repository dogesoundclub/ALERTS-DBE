Item #: SCP-9494

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9494 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber to ensure its safety and to prevent its escape. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-9494 must wear full protective gear, including a gas mask and goggles, due to SCP-9494's tendency to emit hazardous and potentially infectious gases.

Description: SCP-9494 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, measuring approximately 65 cm in height and weighing approximately 12 kg. SCP-9494's most distinguishing feature is its unique eye structure, resembling a pair of ski goggles. SCP-9494 also wears a red beanie on its head and a jade earring on each ear. It is often seen sporting a red scarf and a normal gas mask, which it appears to have acquired and customized to fit its preferences.

SCP-9494 exhibits an absent-minded and forgetful personality, often becoming lost in thought or distracted by various projects. This lack of focus has resulted in some humorous incidents, including missed appointments and forgotten events. However, SCP-9494 also demonstrates a high level of intelligence and creativity, often constructing elaborate contraptions and gadgets from found materials.

SCP-9494 first came to the Foundation's attention when it caused a train derailment while operating as a train driver in [REDACTED]. SCP-9494 has since been contained and has proven to be cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, due to its unique abilities and tendency to forget safety procedures, SCP-9494 has been classified as Euclid and requires continuous monitoring.
