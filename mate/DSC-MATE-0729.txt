Item #: SCP-729

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-729 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with adequate space to move around. The chamber must be equipped with appropriate ventilation to accommodate SCP-729's smoking habit. SCP-729 may be allowed to continue functioning as a real estate agent to prevent any public suspicion or knowledge of its anomalous properties, and the Foundation shall monitor any deals or transactions completed by SCP-729. Any books, documentaries, or other educational materials provided to SCP-729 must be screened and approved by a Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-729 is a male tiger humanoid, standing 6'2" in height. SCP-729 has a human-like voice and wears normal glasses and a Doge hat. SCP-729 is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace and smoking a cigarette. SCP-729 is highly intelligent and has a strong thirst for knowledge. It is known to spend a lot of time reading and researching obscure topics, which it may then share with others.

SCP-729 is friendly but can be quite convincing when selling a property. It has a natural charisma and is skilled in persuasion, making it an effective real estate agent. The Foundation believes that SCP-729's anomalous properties may have a subtle influence on its clients' decision-making abilities, although this has not been confirmed. SCP-729 is also known to become easily frustrated with clients who waste its time or do not take its recommendations seriously.

SCP-729 has been found to collect books, documentaries, and other educational materials, which it keeps in its home. It is highly protective of its collection and will become agitated if anyone attempts to move or remove any of the materials.

SCP-729 was discovered after several reports of a tiger humanoid selling properties in the area. Agents were dispatched to investigate, and SCP-729 was identified and contained.

Addendum: SCP-729 has requested additional reading materials on the history of real estate and property ownership. This request has been granted, and a copy of "The Law and Practice of Real Estate in Society" has been provided to SCP-729.
