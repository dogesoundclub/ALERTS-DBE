Item #: SCP-1827

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1827 is to be monitored via remote video surveillance 24/7. Personnel assigned to SCP-1827 must be trained in emotional regulation techniques to prevent emotional contagion while in her presence. Any emotional outbursts are to be reported to the Site Director immediately. SCP-1827's real estate agency must be monitored for any unusual activity related to anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-1827 is a human female, identified as a real estate agent named Karen with no known surname. She stands at 1.65 meters tall and has a slender build. SCP-1827 has several distinct physical features, including spotted skin and purple lips.

SCP-1827's head is covered with an ushanka hat, and she wears a gold earring on each ear. SCP-1827 also wears a medical mask over her mouth, presumably to conceal her features.

SCP-1827 is highly empathetic and can become easily overwhelmed by emotional stimuli. SCP-1827 has a particular fondness for media that evokes strong emotions, including music and artwork. SCP-1827 has been observed being moved to tears watching sentimental moments in movies or TV shows.

Despite SCP-1827's emotional sensitivity, she has shown no anomalous capabilities or properties. However, SCP-1827's involvement in the sale of anomalous properties gives rise to suspicion that she may be aware of or involved in anomalous activities.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-1827 was observed attempting to sell a property in [REDACTED], which was determined to be a known anomalous location. Foundation agents were dispatched to apprehend SCP-1827, but she had already left the property before their arrival. SCP-1827 is currently at large, and all Foundation personnel are instructed to report any sightings immediately.
