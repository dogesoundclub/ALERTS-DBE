Item #: 2557

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: The individual known as 2557 has been neutralized and is no longer a threat to society.

Description: 2557 was a human female with noticeable spots on her face and a constant smile. Her eyes were replaced with VR Rainbow LED, and she often wore silver chains and an LED gas mask as accessories. She kept her hair in pig-tails and adorned jade earrings.

2557 had a thirst for knowledge and would spend much of her time reading and researching obscure topics. She was quite passionate about sharing her newfound knowledge with others and would often lecture at local universities.

Despite her seemingly harmless nature, 2557 was a villain who sought to use her knowledge to manipulate and control others. She was known to create mind-altering drugs and technologies, all in an attempt to gain power and influence.

Addendum: After years of evading capture, 2557 was finally neutralized by a team of agents from the DogeSoundClub. While her knowledge and technologies were confiscated, some fear that her legacy may live on through those she influenced. Further research is needed in this area.
