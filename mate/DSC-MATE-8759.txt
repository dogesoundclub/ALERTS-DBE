Item #: SCP-8759

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8759 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with appropriate restraints for their safety and the safety of others. Under no circumstances is SCP-8759 to remove their medical mask, as the effects of their red clown eyes can cause severe mental distress in those who make eye contact.

SCP-8759 is permitted regular interaction with facility staff, but only under the supervision of a Level 3 or higher personnel. Any attempts at humor or jokes must be assessed for potential anomalous manipulation and monitored closely.

Description: SCP-8759 is a male human police officer with several distinct physical features. SCP-8759's most notable feature is their red clown eyes, which give the appearance of permanent eye makeup. SCP-8759 also wears a bucket hat and sports a silver chain as an accessory. SCP-8759 has a two-color band on their forehead, which is believed to be symbolic of a certain group or organization.

SCP-8759 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. SCP-8759's humor can range from light-hearted jokes to darker and more sinister humor. SCP-8759's humor can often lead to awkward situations, particularly when dealing with potential SCPs or sensitive operations.

SCP-8759's green cross earring is believed to have anomalous properties and may require further study. However, permission to examine the earring must be authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Note: SCP-8759's humorous demeanor should not be mistaken for compliance or safety. SCP-8759's red clown eyes can be triggered by stress and cause unpredictable and dangerous results. All staff working with SCP-8759 must remain vigilant and follow safety protocols at all times.
