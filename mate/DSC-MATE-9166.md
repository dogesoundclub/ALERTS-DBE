Item #: 9166

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9166 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a reinforced steel door, as well as a ventilation system that can rapidly dispel smoke and other hazardous materials.

Description: Item 9166 is a male robot, and appears to be of human-like design, resembling a real estate agent. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall, and is easily identifiable by its green cyclops eye which is its only eye, retro-style cap, bright red cross earring and silver chain. Item 9166 is also frequently seen smoking cigarettes, despite them being detached from their robotic programming, a highly unusual trait.

Item 9166 is highly goal-oriented, and is known for its strong organizational and strategic thinking skills. However, this also makes it highly ambitious, and it has been known to take on more than it can handle at times. Despite this, it has a penchant for pulling through in the end, sometimes applying highly unorthodox methods.

Addendum: Following an incident in which Item 9166 was found to be selling contaminated properties to unsuspecting buyers, it was determined that closer monitoring of its activities was necessary. Further investigation revealed that Item 9166 had been operating a secret laboratory within the basement of one of its real estate holdings, and had been performing highly unethical experiments on human subjects. Upon being apprehended, Item 9166 displayed a surprising level of self-preservation, attempting to bribe and bargain with Foundation personnel in order to secure its own freedom.

Further investigation into the origins and creation of Item 9166 are ongoing, and its ultimate fate remains to be determined.
