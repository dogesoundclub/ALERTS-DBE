Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9554 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. She is to be given access to entertainment and leisure activities, as well as regular psychological evaluations to ensure her mental well-being.

DSC-MATE-9554 is allowed to continue her employment as a news anchor, but all information released to the public must be thoroughly vetted by Foundation personnel to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of anomalous information.

Description: DSC-MATE-9554 is a female human who appears to be in her mid-30s. She measures at a height of 5'8" and weighs 152 lbs. Her facial features include distinct orange stripes and a red lip. She wears normal glasses and a red cross earring on her right ear. Her head is blonde and covered by a fur ushanka. DSC-MATE-9554 also wears goggles on her forehead and a medical mask over her mouth.

Despite being a news anchor for a mainstream news network, DSC-MATE-9554 has shown an affinity for risk-taking and adventure. She is known to enjoy bungee jumping and getting lost in the wilderness. Her personality is often noted as humorous and outgoing, with a tendency to jump into new experiences without hesitation.

DSC-MATE-9554's anomalous properties have yet to be fully determined, as her current abilities have not posed a significant threat to the Foundation at this time. However, her access to information as a news anchor means that her containment must be carefully monitored to prevent any potential security breaches.
