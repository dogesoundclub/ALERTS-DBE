Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7315 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. All interview sessions should be conducted with caution and with minimal personnel. DSC-MATE-7315 is to be under constant supervision and should always be kept under heavy sedation in case of sudden outbreaks of its anomalous behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-7315 is a male human that presents abnormal physical features. The subject possesses red clown eyes, covered in green hair, and wears a purple cap. DSC-MATE-7315 also presents spots all over its face and a clown mouth. On its forehead, DSC-MATE-7315 can be seen wearing a pair of goggles. Additionally, the subject wears a gold earring and a silver chain.

DSC-MATE-7315 displays the characteristics of a normal human, but with a passion for argumentation and debate. The subject exhibits a sharp wit and enjoys engaging in playful arguments with friends and family. However, when engaging in intense debate or facing a confrontation, DSC-MATE-7315 displays an unpredictable behavior. The subject suddenly gains the ability to summon a red, translucent force field that appears to protect it from physical harm. Whenever DSC-MATE-7315 is under duress, it will grimace and emit a loud scream, causing a wave of soundwaves that distort its opponents' hearing.

DSC-MATE-7315 claims to be a renowned lawyer working for a law firm known for defending anomalous entities. However, there is no record of the said law firm, and attempts to investigate DSC-MATE-7315's background have yielded no results.

Addendum: Interview Log

Dr. ██████: Good morning, DSC-MATE-7315. Are you feeling well?

DSC-MATE-7315: Well, Doc, what do you think? I am kept in this cell against my will. No, I am not feeling well.

Dr. ██████: What can you tell us about your anomalous ability to summon a force field?

DSC-MATE-7315: Ah, that. I wouldn't call it an ability, but more of a safety precaution. You never know when things might get out of hand.

Dr. ██████: What do you mean by "out of hand"?

DSC-MATE-7315: You know, Doc, when people stop talking and start fighting. That's when I have to protect myself.

Dr. ██████: Can you tell us about the law firm you work for?

DSC-MATE-7315: Ah, yes, my beloved firm. But I cannot reveal much about it. I need to keep the identities of my clients safe, you know.

Dr. ██████: We have found no records of your firm. Can you explain that?

DSC-MATE-7315: Of course, Doc. Our firm operates in the shadows, without a trace. We are the best at keeping anomalous entities and their activities under wraps.

Dr. ██████: Very well. Thank you for your time, DSC-MATE-7315.

DSC-MATE-7315: Anytime, Doc. But remember, never stop arguing!
