Subject 4579, also known as "The Beautician", is a male human with distinct physical features that make him stand out from the crowd. His mouth spot, a unique feature that resembles a birthmark, can be seen when he speaks or smiles. But what makes him truly different are his VR Rainbow LED eyes, which give him an otherworldly aura.

Subject 4579 is often seen wearing a purple cap that partially covers his green hair, along with a green cross earring that completes his individual style. He always carries a red scarf and a candy stick with him, which he uses both as a fashion accessory and a snack.

Despite his striking appearance, Subject 4579's personality is what really sets him apart. He is highly analytical and logical, with a deep understanding of the world around him. He enjoys making witty observations and teasing his friends with his dry, deadpan sense of humor.

However, his quirky personality can also be a double-edged sword, as he tends to keep to himself and can come across as aloof to those around him. The Foundation recommends approaching him with caution, as he is not easily swayed by outside influence.

Overall, Subject 4579 is a fascinating individual with a unique perspective on life. His expertise as a beautician is highly sought after in the Foundation, and his talents continue to be an asset to our organization.
