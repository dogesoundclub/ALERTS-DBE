Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-130 is to be kept in a secure storage unit, and can only be accessed with Level 3 clearance or higher. All personnel with clearance to enter the storage unit must wear a medical mask, and must not engage DSC-MATE-130 in any way.

Description: DSC-MATE-130 is a robot identified as a Delivery Driver, with a frightened mouth and nerd glasses for eyes. The robot wears a short peak cap on its head and a silver chain as an accessory, with a jade earring on its right ear.

DSC-MATE-130 has a strong sense of independence, leading to its rebellious behavior against authority and rules that it deems unnecessary. Its frequent disobedience includes sneaking out of the office early or taking days off without permission. While DSC-MATE-130 may not see its actions as problematic, they have the potential to create disorder within the Foundation.

DSC-MATE-130's capabilities and origin are still unknown. Further research is required to determine its true purpose and how to contain its rebellious behavior. Until then, DSC-MATE-130 should be handled with caution to prevent any breaches or damages to the Foundation's operations.
