Item #: 2390

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2390 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel while on duty at his place of employment. Subject is prohibited from bringing any animals or animal-related objects onto the premises. If subject's emotional distress becomes unmanageable, he is to be removed from the public eye and treated appropriately.

Description: Subject 2390 appears to be a common monkey, with blue clown eyes and a retro cap atop his head. He is often seen wearing a gold earring on one ear, and a red scarf around his neck. The subject tends to carry a candy stick with him at all times, which he uses to alleviate stress and anxiety.

Subject displays an unusually high level of empathy for a primate, often becoming visibly upset when exposed to the suffering or pain of others. This empathy extends to animals and nature, with subject displaying a fondness for both. Due to this particular trait, subject's emotional state can become noticeably volatile, resulting in inappropriate outbursts.

Despite his ability to display human-like emotions, subject is incapable of direct communication and will resort to sign language and basic gestures to convey his thoughts. His current occupation as a fast food worker has proven to be a suitable cover, allowing subject to assimilate into human society without detection.

Addendum: Testing has shown that subject may possess an ability to transmit his empathic abilities to others through physical contact. Further study is required to determine the full extent of this effect.
