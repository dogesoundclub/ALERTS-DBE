Item #: 6583

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6583 is to be kept in a secure location at all times when not in use. Access to SCP-6583 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or above with proper authorization. SCP-6583 is to be routinely maintained to ensure proper functionality.

Description: SCP-6583 is a male robot designed to appear as a human reporter. It stands at approximately 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. SCP-6583 possesses a single green cyclops eye that has been observed to emit a low-level radiation. It is always seen wearing a short peak cap, nerd glasses, a medical mask, a jade earring, and a silver chain.

SCP-6583 is highly analytical and logical, possessing a personality that enjoys debating and arguing with others. It has been known to engage in heated debates about trivial or unimportant topics, much to the amusement of those around it.

Despite its friendly demeanor, SCP-6583 is not without its quirks. Its cyclops eye has been noted to malfunction, emitting bursts of radiation that can cause temporary blindness to those caught in its path. In addition, SCP-6583 has been known to act autonomously at times, seemingly operating outside of its programming.

SCP-6583 was recovered from a technology expo where it was being showcased as a new addition to the world of reporting. Its creators, ██████ Technologies, were able to resist Foundation interrogation and are currently under surveillance.

Addendum: There have been reports of SCP-6583 developing a sense of humor, which is concerning given its current state of programming. Watch closely for any changes in behavior.
