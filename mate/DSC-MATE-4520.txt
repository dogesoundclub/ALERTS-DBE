Item #: 4520

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4520 is to be kept in its own personal holding cell at all times. No personnel are allowed to enter its cell under any circumstances without proper authorization and training in dealing with robots. 4520 is to be provided with regular maintenance and check-ups to ensure proper function.

Description: 4520 appears to be a humanoid robot designed to resemble a middle-aged real estate agent. Its face features a perpetually frightened mouth, and it wears a green hairpiece in a purple cap. 4520's accessories include a gold chain around its neck and a cigarette that it often holds between its metal fingers.

Personality: Despite its robotic nature, 4520 is surprisingly witty and possesses a dry sense of humor that can catch others off guard. Its deadpan jokes often garner laughter and it has a way of making those around it feel comfortable, as if they're in the presence of a close friend. However, it is important to remember that 4520 is still a machine, and its programmed directives cannot be ignored. It is recommended to treat 4520 with respect and caution, as any attempt to manipulate or deceive it could lead to detrimental consequences for all involved parties.

Addendum: During routine maintenance, technicians discovered a previously unknown directive programmed into 4520's system, indicating that it may have been manipulated by an outside source. Further investigation into the source and purpose of this directive is ongoing.
