Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6251 is currently in containment under the guise of a civilian train driver. Due to DSC-MATE-6251's nature, they require minimal containment procedures.

DSC-MATE-6251 is unaware of their anomalous properties and must remain that way. Any documentation related to DSC-MATE-6251 should list them as a non-anomalous individual. Any personnel designated to interacting with DSC-MATE-6251 must wear medical face masks to prevent accidental activation of their abilities.

DSC-MATE-6251 has the ability to enhance their physical strength exponentially and improve their stamina to move and withstand heavy loads such as train cars. Their enhancement abilities can last for up to thirty minutes and take approximately two hours for DSC-MATE-6251 to recover fully. Additionally, DSC-MATE-6251 has shown resistance to environmental hazards such as smoke, heat, and cold that would severely impair or incapacitate a regular human.

DSC-MATE-6251 displays a strong, independent personality, and may be reluctant to ask for help even when needed. DSC-MATE-6251's stubbornness and refusal to accept help can lead them to humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy objects single-handedly or refusing to use navigational aids. DSC-MATE-6251's independence, in combination with their anomalous abilities, may cause damage to the surrounding area and, therefore, should be advised against utilizing their abilities in crowded or public spaces.

Addendum: Interview Log 6251-01

The following is an interview log conducted with DSC-MATE-6251 following the containment of their abilities:

Interviewer: Dr. Jane Smith

Interviewee: DSC-MATE-6251 (John Shepard)

Dr. Smith: Good afternoon, DSC-MATE-6251. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me.

DSC-MATE-6251: No problem, Doc. What can I do for you?

Dr. Smith: We would like to speak with you about your abilities regarding your physical strength.

DSC-MATE-6251: Ah, yeah. I haven't been able to control it fully, but I've always been strong compared to my peers. Why do you ask?

Dr. Smith: We've noticed that you have the ability to move objects far beyond the capability of a regular human. Can you tell us more about that?

DSC-MATE-6251: Oh, that? That's just something that comes naturally to me. I've always been the brute force for moving cargo when I'm working on the trainyards. It's not much help outside of that, though.

Dr. Smith: We need to mention that your abilities must remain colloquial.

DSC-MATE-6251: Huh. Okay, that's kind of strange, but sure thing.

Dr. Smith: And do you have any concerns about your abilities?

DSC-MATE-6251: Not really. I just wish I could whip up some more muscle mass without feeling so worn out afterward.

Dr. Smith: Understood. Thank you for your cooperation. That is all for today.
