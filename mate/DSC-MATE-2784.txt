Description: SCP-2784 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin, standing at 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 100 kilograms. Its body is composed of various metals and alloys, with a green Cyclops eye situated in the center of its head. SCP-2784 has a gold earring ornament piercing through its left ear.

SCP-2784's primary function is that of a farmer. It possesses the ability to cultivate crops with ease and precision, as well as other tasks related to agriculture. SCP-2784 is often seen wearing a normal gas mask, which serves to protect its internal components from airborne contaminants.

SCP-2784's personality is characterized as systematic and detail-oriented. It is known to be efficient and organized, sometimes even to the point of being controlling. SCP-2784 can take charge of group tasks or events and delegate tasks in a very matter-of-fact way, which can lead to humorous situations.

Addendum: Research into SCP-2784's origins is ongoing. Dr. ██████ believes that SCP-2784 was constructed by a long-dormant civilization, likely for agricultural purposes. Further investigation is required to determine the accuracy of this theory. SCP-2784 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation's agricultural needs.
