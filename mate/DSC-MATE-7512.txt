SCP-7512 is a remarkable specimen of their kind, standing tall and proud as a male tiger. The piercing gaze of their ski goggle eyes can strike a sense of unease into even the bravest of souls, and they are often seen donning a police cap atop their striped head. Adorning one of their ears is a stunning jade earring, lending an air of regal refinement to their appearance.

But do not be fooled by their striking exterior, for SCP-7512 is more than just a mere beast. Their profession as a doctor has given them a keen sense of empathy, and they are deeply in tune with their own emotions as well as the emotions of those around them. It is not uncommon to see them moved to tears by poignant moments in film, and they have a profound appreciation for music and art that can evoke strong feelings.

Despite their emotional depth, SCP-7512 is also known for their fierce loyalty and protective nature. They will stand up for those in need, using their strength and sharp claws to defend those who cannot defend themselves. Their attention to detail and sharp analytical skills make them an asset in medical situations, able to diagnose and treat with precision and care.

SCP-7512 may appear intimidating at first glance, but beneath their fearsome exterior lies a sensitive and empathetic soul, ready and willing to help those in need.
