Item #: SCP-2334

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2334 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. Access to SCP-2334's chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher, and any interaction with SCP-2334 must be approved by at least two senior researchers.

SCP-2334's job as a veterinarian may be utilized by the Foundation as necessary, but daily routine check-ins with on-site psychological staff are mandatory.

Description: SCP-2334 is a middle-aged human male standing at approximately 180cm tall and weighing 86 kg. SCP-2334 displays a distinctive mouth spot birthmark on the left side of his lower lip, with thick black-rimmed nerd glasses adorning his dark brown eyes.

SCP-2334 appears to have an affinity for accessorizing, as he is often seen wearing a green cross earring on his right ear and sporting a pair of goggles atop his forehead. SCP-2334 is also known to wear a silver chain around his neck and has been observed smoking cigarettes while on-site.

SCP-2334 is known for being extremely detail-oriented, with a tendency to organize objects in a particular order. This trait may manifest itself in unexpected ways, such as color-coding clothing or alphabetizing spice racks. Despite SCP-2334's focus on order, he is known to become agitated in situations when his routine is disrupted.

SCP-2334's personality is generally reserved, and he tends to avoid engaging with personnel unless necessary. While SCP-2334 does appear to hold a certain degree of expertise in veterinary medicine, he is not entirely forthcoming with information regarding his professional background.

Addendum: It has been noted by research staff that despite SCP-2334's coherent and non-threatening demeanor, he appears to be withholding information regarding his past. Requests for further interrogation have been denied, pending approval by Senior Staff.
