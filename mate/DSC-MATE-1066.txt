Item #: SCP-1066

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1066 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a bed, table, chair, and writing materials to enable SCP-1066 to continue their profession as a reporter. SCP-1066 is to be supplied with fresh vegetables, fruits, and grains as their primary diet. SCP-1066 is not to be granted permission to leave their cell unaccompanied, and their interviews and reports must be screened and approved by senior staff.

Description: SCP-1066 is a male rabbit of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. Their size and features are typical of the species but bear noticeable human influences, such as a retro cap and a jade earring. SCP-1066's mouth is often found in a frightened or nervous position, and their eyes take on the appearance of ski goggles. The entity carries a whistle as its primary accessory.

SCP-1066 has a strong sense of independence and is known to resist authority or rules which they regard as unnecessary. This rebellious behavior is often seen as disobedient, such as sneaking out of the containment chamber early, or taking unauthorized time off work. SCP-1066 is a skilled reporter and has a reputation for writing stories that delve deeper than the usual fluff. However, their investigative attitude and tendency to expose corruption among those with the authority have created adversaries within the local political arena.

Addendum: After SCP-1066's recent report regarding the disappearance of several children from the local park, Foundation operatives were dispatched to investigate. On-site, they discovered a subterranean entrance to a previously unknown SCP facility, where several children were held captive. The perpetrators were identified as individuals within the local government, who had been using the SCP facility for their illegal activities.

Thanks to SCP-1066's report, over a dozen children were safely removed from the facility, and local authorities have arrested those responsible. Consequently, SCP-1066's contributions to Foundation research have earned the entity several commendations.

Note: SCP-1066's tendency to defy authority may prove to be detrimental to its well-being, as well as the well-being of those around it. Its investigative skills and fearless personality make them a valuable asset to the Foundation, but it is crucial to ensure that they remain well-contained and secure. - Dr. ██████.
