SCP Identification Number 767 refers to a peculiar human male who goes by the profession of a reporter. This individual has been described as having a face that generally bears a smile, which may give a false sense of security to unsuspecting individuals who interact with him. However, upon closer inspection, one may notice they wear a pair of nerd glasses over their eyes, indicating a potentially ingenious mind that is working overtime.

The subject has been recorded to have a head of normal blonde hair, which is quite unremarkable but well-groomed. SCP-767 is often seen sporting a gold chain and a cigarette, which they chain-smoke with alarming frequency. These accessories may serve as both a sign of their established identity and an attempt to hide their true intentions.

Those who have interacted with SCP-767 have noted that their personality is marked with a keen sense of impulsivity; they have been observed to undertake risks or make spur-of-the-moment decisions without much prior thought. While this trait helps them adapt to unpredictable situations and prepare for any eventuality, it also lands them in seemingly dangerous and often comical situations.

As with all human subjects, SCP-767's capabilities and potential risks should be monitored and recorded carefully. Their knowledge of the supernatural world should be watched closely, as they may possess knowledge that could lead to potentially fragile situations. Handle with caution.
