Item #: 315

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 315 is to be contained within a typical office space with standard safety protocols. He is to be kept out of contact with individuals who may be considered easily intimidated or overly impressionable.

Description:
Subject 315 is a male human who works as a banker. He has a frightened mouth that suggests an almost constant state of anxiety. His eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology, which allows him to see multiple levels of light and color that are otherwise inaccessible to the naked eye. His head is adorned with a peak spike, which serves as a protective feature for his fragile skull. He wears a single gold earring in one ear, and often carries around a candy stick as a stress-relieving tool.

Personality:
Subject 315 is highly outgoing and social, with an ability to capture and hold the attention of those around him. His natural charisma makes him the life of the party and his talent for telling humorous stories and jokes delights all those who hear them. However, his underlying anxiety often leads him to overthink and overreact to stressful situations, leading to some potentially dangerous consequences.

Addendum:
Subject 315's access to sensitive banking information has been restricted due to his personality traits and potential to be influenced or intimidated by those wishing to abuse his position. He is to be monitored closely at all times to ensure the safety of his clients and colleagues.
