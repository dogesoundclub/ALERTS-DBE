Item #: SCP-5910

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5910 is to be kept in Cell 5910-B, which must be equipped with a ventilation system connected to the outside of the Foundation to ensure that the air is breathable for SCP-5910. SCP-5910 is allowed to keep its gold chain and normal gas mask as these items pose no threat to containment. Any other items and accessories found in possession of SCP-5910 must be confiscated.

Description: SCP-5910 is a male rabbit approximately 1 meter in height. Its face features include a frightened mouth and red clown eyes, which appear to be a result of SCP-5910's species rather than any anomalous effect. SCP-5910 wears a red beanie with a victory band and a goggle on its forehead. SCP-5910 also has a jade earring on each ear, which are believed to be purely decorative. SCP-5910 exhibits empathetic and compassionate behavior, which can lead to it taking on others' problems as its own. This behavior is both admirable and exhausting for SCP-5910.

SCP-5910 is employed as a firefighter by the Foundation due to its ability to fit into small spaces and its agility. SCP-5910 has also shown a high level of intelligence and problem-solving skills, making it a valuable asset in containment operations requiring small spaces.

Addendum: SCP-5910 has been observed to express distress when observing other rabbits in captivity. Further research is needed to determine if this is due to SCP-5910 being anomalous or simply a natural reaction to captivity.
