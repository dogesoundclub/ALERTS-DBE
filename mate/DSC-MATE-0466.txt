Item #: SCP-466

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-466 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its nature as a farmer, SCP-466 is permitted to have access to a specialized containment yard, where it can further manipulate its environment for farming purposes. SCP-466 is to receive daily check-ins from Site personnel, but otherwise does not require any further attention.

Description: SCP-466 manifests as a male rabbit, standing approximately 1.5 meters in height. It wears a pair of nerd glasses and a single jade earring on its right ear, in addition to several pieces of clothing, including a silver chain and a cigarette. Despite its unconventional appearance, SCP-466 is fully capable of functioning in human society, and has even maintained employment as a farmer.

SCP-466 possesses a highly practical and hands-on personality, lending to its ability to fix even the most complex of problems using unconventional solutions. It has been observed using duct tape, paper clips, and other household items to repair objects and rig up makeshift solutions. SCP-466 has even developed these skills for use in its farming endeavors, often modifying tools and equipment to better suit its needs.

Whilst SCP-466's anomalous properties may seem disconcerting, they do not pose any immediate threat. However, Foundation personnel should remain aware of its abilities to manipulate its environment and adapt to new situations in its pursuit of farming.
