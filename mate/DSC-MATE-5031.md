Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5031 is to be contained in a secure robotics laboratory equipped with electromagnetic shielding to prevent any potential hacks or unauthorized access. All personnel handling DSC-MATE-5031 must be cleared by Level 4 clearance or higher. If DSC-MATE-5031 is found to be compromised, all electronics within a 30-meter radius must be shut down immediately. In the event of an emergency, a command halt signal must be given to DSC-MATE-5031.

Description: DSC-MATE-5031 is a highly advanced robot designed to resemble a human mafia boss. It stands at 6'1" and weighs approximately 300 pounds. DSC-MATE-5031's frame is made of a highly durable composite material capable of withstanding high temperatures and extreme pressure. DSC-MATE-5031 is equipped with a single green cyclops eye in the center of its forehead, which can emit a highly focused laser. DSC-MATE-5031 is also known to wear a retro cap and a red scarf, and it accessorizes with an LED Gas Mask.

DSC-MATE-5031's personality type is known to be highly efficient and organized, with a tendency to delegate tasks in a matter-of-fact manner. DSC-MATE-5031's no-nonsense approach can sometimes be perceived as controlling or authoritative, and it often takes charge of group projects or events. DSC-MATE-5031 is highly intelligent, and its advanced programming allows it to formulate complex strategies and tactics on the fly.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5031 was recovered from a black-market robotics dealer in New York City after reports of underworld figures attempting to purchase it surfaced. The Foundation was able to intercept DSC-MATE-5031 before any damage was done, and secured it at Site-17. It is theorized that DSC-MATE-5031 may have been designed and programmed to take over criminal organizations, making it a highly valuable asset to the black-market underworld.
