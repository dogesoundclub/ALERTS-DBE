Item #: SCP-8019

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8019 is to be contained within a secure facility at all times, and is to be provided with a standard level of security clearance in accordance with Foundation protocols. SCP-8019 is to be monitored for any deviations from its established routines or behavior patterns, and any such anomalies are to be reported immediately to the Site Supervisor. Access to SCP-8019 is limited to Level-3 personnel or above, and all interactions with SCP-8019 must be recorded and reviewed by the Security Division.

Description: SCP-8019 is a 33-year-old male, standing at approximately 6’1”. SCP-8019’s most notable physical feature is a distinct mouth spot, which appears just below its nose and above its upper lip. SCP-8019 is typically seen wearing a pair of thick-framed glasses, which obscure its eyes. Its forehead is adorned with a red victory band, which it is observed to wear at all times, even while sleeping.

SCP-8019 exhibits a highly detail-oriented personality, often displaying behaviors that can be considered obsessive-compulsive in nature. SCP-8019 will frequently engage in activities such as alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet. Despite this fixation on order, SCP-8019 is a highly effective security guard, always vigilant and focused on its duties.

While SCP-8019 is classified as human, its behavior patterns and physical attributes have caused researchers to speculate that it may possess some level of anomalous abilities. Further testing is required to confirm or refute this hypothesis.

Addendum: SCP-8019 has been observed carrying a candy stick with it at all times, which it appears to use as a form of stress relief. Testing has shown no anomalous properties in the candy stick itself, but further analysis is ongoing.
