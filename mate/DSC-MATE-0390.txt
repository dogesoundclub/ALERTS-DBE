Item #: 390

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 390, also known as "The Politician," is currently held in a specially designed containment chamber located in Site-██. Proper decontamination procedures are required for all personnel entering the chamber due to the subject's contact with the general public. All conversations with the subject must first be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. 

Description: Subject 390 is a female human, standing at 5'9" with a spotty complexion. The subject's most notable facial feature is their red clown eyes, which are a result of a genetic mutation. Her head, which is made of a metallic blue material, features a two-color band across her forehead. Subject 390 also wears a red cross earring on each ear and a medical mask over her mouth. She is often seen wearing a silver chain around her neck. 

Personality: Subject 390 is a very organized and dependable individual who has a tendency to be a bit stubborn. She is inflexible in her ways and unwilling to accept new ideas, which can lead to challenges when she encounters unexpected situations. Despite this, the subject is known for her intelligence and poise, which make her an excellent politician. However, her willingness to do whatever it takes to accomplish her goals has led to speculation around her ethical conduct. 

Additional notes: Due to the subject's public status, there is an ongoing effort to keep her inclusion in the Foundation under wraps. However, her anomalous attributes and political ties make her a valuable candidate for further study. Further interviews and tests are required to fully understand the extent of her abilities.
