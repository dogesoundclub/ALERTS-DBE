Item #: SCP-8892

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8892 is to be monitored at all times while operating locomotives, and under no circumstances should they be allowed to operate any train or locomotive without proper supervision. Any deviation in behavior or any anomalous activity is to be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-8892 is a male human, identified as a train driver. His physical appearance includes facial features such as orange stripes, a frightened mouth, and normal glasses. His head is blonde, and he wears a gold earring and a red scarf as accessories. SCP-8892 has displayed a natural talent for leadership, often taking charge of situations in both work and social settings.

SCP-8892's anomalous ability has not been fully understood, as it appears to be linked to their personal attributes of leadership and confidence. When in control of a train or locomotive, SCP-8892 displays an almost supernatural level of focus and determination. Witnesses have reported that SCP-8892, while operating a train or locomotive, seems to be in a trance-like state, as if guided by an otherworldly force.

Attempts to replicate this ability in other individuals have been unsuccessful, suggesting that it is unique to SCP-8892. It is unknown whether SCP-8892's abilities are a result of genetic mutation or supernatural influence.

SCP-8892 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and has expressed a desire to understand and control their anomalous abilities. However, due to the potential danger of SCP-8892's abilities, they are to be monitored and contained to ensure the safety of the public and the Foundation.
