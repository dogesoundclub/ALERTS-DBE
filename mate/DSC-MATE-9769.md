Item #: 9769

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9769 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, outfitted with the usual amenities including an exercise area and feeding station. DSC-MATE-9769 is to be served a daily diet of fresh fruits, vegetables and nuts, and kept entertained with puzzles and toys. Should DSC-MATE-9769 show any signs of aberrant behavior or agitation, personnel are advised to remain calm and utilize calming techniques as needed.

Description: DSC-MATE-9769 is a male monkey with all the physical attributes common to its species, with the added features of large nerd glasses, a stylish mohawk, and a jade earring on one ear. DSC-MATE-9769 displays an outgoing and social personality, often seeking the attention of others and regaling them with humorous stories and jokes. DSC-MATE-9769 is highly intelligent, and possesses a unique ability for problem-solving and mechanical aptitude, as evidenced by its job as a train driver prior to containment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9769 was brought to Foundation attention after reports of a train derailment in the Midwest that was attributed to a rogue engineer. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the engineer in question was in fact DSC-MATE-9769, who had learned to operate the vehicle on its own. Though its intentions were initially unknown, it was determined that DSC-MATE-9769 had been attempting to reunite with a mate that had previously been shipped to another location, and had commandeered the train with that objective in mind.

Analysis: DSC-MATE-9769 appears to be a solitary anomaly, with no known connections to any other DSC objects or entities. Its abilities present a potential risk to both itself and others, however, the subject has thus far proven to be willing to cooperate with Foundation personnel. Further study is needed to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-9769's intelligence and whether it poses any larger threat.
