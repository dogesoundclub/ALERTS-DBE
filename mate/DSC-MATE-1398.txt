Item #: SCP-1398

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1398 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-1398 must be restricted to personnel with Level 2 security clearance or higher. Any attempt by SCP-1398 to leave containment must be met with immediate full-force detainment.

Description: SCP-1398 is a human male with orange stripes appearing on his forehead, nose and cheeks. His mouth is constantly in a frightened expression, and his eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology. SCP-1398's head is always covered by a hoodie which shows no apparent branding. He carries a Candy Stick as an accessory at all times.

SCP-1398's personality traits include an organized and reliable nature. However, SCP-1398 is often stubborn and rigid when it comes to new ideas or unexpected changes. This trait has led to several humorous situations during encounters with anomalous entities.

SCP-1398 is employed as a police officer, and his skills in law enforcement have led to successful containment and neutralization of several anomalous entities. However, SCP-1398 has attempted to contain entities without authorization from the Foundation, leading to several containment breaches in the past.

Addendum: It is imperative that SCP-1398 understands the importance of following Foundation protocols at all times, especially in emergency situations. Efforts to persuade SCP-1398 of the necessity of full adherence to protocol are ongoing.
