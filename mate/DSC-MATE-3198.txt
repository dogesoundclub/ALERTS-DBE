SPECIES DESIGNATION: HUMANOID-3198

DESCRIPTION: The humanoid designated as 3198 appears as a female of average build and height. Their most notable facial features are the spots dotted across her cheeks and the deep purple hue of her lips, which add an unusual touch to an otherwise ordinary appearance. 3198 has typical human eyes hidden behind a pair of framed glasses, and her hair is styled in playful pig tails.

ACCESSORIES: Along with her unusual face features, 3198 is often seen wearing a medical mask over her mouth that obscures her expression. She also dons a silver chain around her neck, which seems to have some sort of personal significance.

PERSONALITY: Despite the seemingly serious nature of her profession as a lawyer, 3198 displays a lighthearted, playful side that can lead to humorous interactions with others. She values harmony and social connections, and is quick to engage in friendly banter or tell a joke to ease tensions. Her unique appearance and goofy personality make her stand out, but those who spend time around her find her to be a crucial addition to whatever community she's involved with. 

CAUTION: While this humanoid appears to be harmless, take care not to underestimate her playful and charming nature. Those who cross her may find themselves on the wrong end of some clever legal maneuvering, or a well-timed prank.
