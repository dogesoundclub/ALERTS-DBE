Item #: SCP-3071

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-3071 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Access to SCP-3071 is only allowed to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. When interacting with SCP-3071, staff must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and keep the conversation strictly professional. SCP-3071 is not allowed any entertainment devices or materials.

Description:
SCP-3071 is a female human with a unique physical appearance. She has blue clown eyes, an unnatural purple lip, and green cross earrings. She wears a black choker and a standard gas mask that she is seen wearing at all times. SCP-3071 has a great sense of humor, and she takes pleasure in making others laugh, often by telling funny stories and doing silly impersonations. Despite her cheerful personality, SCP-3071 has been classified as a villain due to her history of dangerous criminal activities.

SCP-3071 has exhibited the ability to manipulate people's emotions through her laughter, causing uncontrollable giggling and uncontrollable crying, depending on what kind of emotion she wants to convey. However, at this point, it is unclear if this is a natural ability or the result of technology SCP-3071 has implanted in herself.

SCP-3071's criminal record shows a history of bank robberies and kidnappings; however, her motivations for these actions are unknown. When questioned about her past, SCP-3071 becomes evasive and refuses to provide any information.

Addendum:
SCP-3071 was brought into the Foundation after being captured by the police during a failed bank robbery attempt. SCP-3071 resisted arrest by causing several of the officers to laugh uncontrollably, but was subdued and taken into custody. Foundation personnel were alerted to the case, and SCP-3071 was transferred to the Foundation's custody. SCP-3071's cooperation with the Foundation has been minimal, and she remains a complex and enigmatic figure. Further research is necessary to fully understand SCP-3071's abilities and motivations.
