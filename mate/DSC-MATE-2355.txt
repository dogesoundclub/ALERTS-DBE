SCP-2355 is a tiger farmer with a frightened look in his mouth. His eyes remain a mystery, with no discernible color or characteristic. However, he does wear a pair of jade earrings, which are believed to enhance his senses. In addition, he adorns himself with a gold chain and a candy stick, which he often uses to keep himself calm.

SCP-2355's personality is marked by his obsession with order and efficiency. He takes charge of group projects and delegating tasks to others, often coming across as a bit controlling. Despite this, his attention to detail makes him a valuable asset in any situation. 

Due to his animalistic instincts, SCP-2355 has an enhanced sense of smell and is sensitive to the emotions of others. He is known to use these abilities to get to the root of any problem and solve it efficiently. However, his heightened senses also leave him vulnerable to external stimuli, which can cause him to become agitated or lose control. 

Overall, SCP-2355's unique nature as a tiger farmer, along with his organized and efficient personality, makes him a valuable asset to the Foundation's efforts in the urban fantasy world. However, he must always remain under close observation to prevent any outbursts or lapses in control.
