Item #: 6214

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 6214 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times. Interaction with other personnel is limited and must only take place under strict supervision. Any attempts to tamper with or damage Officer 6214 must be reported immediately.

Description: Officer 6214 is a robotic police officer, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. He has a frightened expression on his mouth and wears horned rim glasses over his eyes. His purple cap has a headset attached, and he has a pair of goggles on his forehead. Officer 6214 accessorizes with a red scarf.

Personality: Despite being a machine, Officer 6214 has exhibited a caring and nurturing personality. He tends to be protective of those around him, and his actions can sometimes be seen as overly protective, particularly towards his friends and family members. This peculiar nature can result in comical situations, as he treats others around him as if they were his own children.

It remains unknown how the robot developed such a compassionate outlook, as it contradicts its original programming as a law enforcement robot. Nevertheless, Officer 6214 has been deemed an anomaly and requires strict security measures to contain him.

Addendum: Officer 6214 has shown an exceptional aptitude for solving crimes using unorthodox means. His ability to connect with people on a personal level, coupled with his analytical skills, make him a valuable asset in investigations, particularly those that require more delicate handling. However, his tendency to put himself in danger to protect others must be monitored at all times.
