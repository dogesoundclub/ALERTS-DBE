Item #: SCP-5291

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5291 is to be contained within a rural farming community, where it can continue its chosen profession while monitored by Foundation personnel. The land on which SCP-5291 operates must be privately owned, and any civilians entering the area must sign a non-disclosure agreement before doing so. SCP-5291 is allowed to contact family members and loved ones, under careful supervision and controlled circumstances.

Description: SCP-5291 is a human male of unknown age, possessing a unique set of physical features. SCP-5291’s mouth contains a distinct spot, which appears to be a genetic anomaly. The subject’s eyes have been surgically replaced with virtual reality rainbow LED orbs, which can change color and brightness at will. SCP-5291 often wears a police cap atop their head, with a gold earring and silver chain adorning their ears and neck respectively. The subject is frequently seen smoking cigarettes.

SCP-5291 is well-known for their love of debate and quick wit. Despite being a small rural farmer by profession, the subject has been known to engage in lively, playful arguments with friends and family members for sport. Though this aspect of SCP-5291’s personality may seem harmless, it has been observed to become dangerous in certain circumstances. Containment personnel should be mindful of SCP-5291’s tendency towards verbal confrontation, especially if provoked or threatened.

Addendum: SCP-5291 has been observed displaying unusual abilities, including the ability to telekinetically manipulate certain objects. Further experimentation is necessary to determine the exact extent of these abilities and how they might be related to SCP-5291’s unique physical features.
