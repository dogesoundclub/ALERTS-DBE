Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4476 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-4476 is limited to Level 2 personnel or higher with written approval from at least two Level 3 senior staff members. SCP-4476 is to be provided with materials and tools necessary to maintain their job as a mechanic. All interactions with SCP-4476 must be monitored and recorded.

Description: SCP-4476 is a human female with several anomalous features. Their face displays distinctive orange stripes, and their eyes are large, blue clown eyes. SCP-4476's hair is blonde and contains a single, large wing on the left side of their head. They also possess a two-color band on their forehead and green cross earrings. SCP-4476 frequently wears a choker around their neck.

SCP-4476 possesses an outgoing and social personality, often engaging in conversations and telling jokes. They have a unique talent for humor, being able to make others laugh with ease. It is unclear if this is an anomalous trait or a learned behavior.

SCP-4476 currently works as a mechanic and uses their anomalous abilities to fix damaged vehicles and machinery with ease. SCP-4476 is cooperative with Foundation staff, but it is advised to limit personal interactions, as their outgoing personality may put them at risk of sharing classified information.

Addendum: SCP-4476 expressed interest in creating an anomalous humanoid vehicle. This request has been denied, and any attempts to create such a vehicle should be reported to Foundation personnel immediately.
