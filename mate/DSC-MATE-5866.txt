Item #: SCP-5866

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5866 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to its nature as a functioning police officer, SCP-5866 is allowed access to certain areas of Site-██ under supervision, per approval from site director. SCP-5866's functions and programming are to be regularly maintained and monitored by the Site-██ technology division.

Description: SCP-5866 is a humanoid robot, standing approximately 6'2" tall, with various accoutrements attached to its body. Its head is adorned with a short peak cap and a pair of nerd glasses, while goggles are strapped to its forehead. SCP-5866's mouth is covered with a medical mask, which appears to have no functional purpose.

SCP-5866's personality appears to be highly adaptable and ranges from serious and stern to humorous and outgoing in social situations. SCP-5866 is programmed with a strong sense of duty and responsibility, consistent with the occupation of a police officer. However, it also displays an appreciation for humor and entertainment, which often leads it to be the life of the party in social situations.

SCP-5866's gold earring and chain add additional decorative embellishments to its body, although their purpose is unknown.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-5866 displayed an unusual behavior during a routine maintenance session. When the technician attempted to replace its gold chain, SCP-5866 resisted, stating that it was a gift from its previous partner, and displayed distress at the notion of losing it. Further investigation into SCP-5866's programming and background history is ongoing.
