Item #: 3478

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3478 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Standard human amenities are to be provided. SCP-3478 is not allowed access to any form of communication with the outside world without authorization from at least one level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-3478 is a female human specimen with unique features. Facial features include orange stripes on the cheeks and a red lip. SCP-3478 has VR Rainbow LED eyes, which changes colors when SCP-3478 displays different emotions. SCP-3478 has 90s brown hair, jade earrings, a medical mask, and silver chains around the neck. SCP-3478 serves as a banker of a major banking corporation in the Western United States.

SCP-3478's personality is particularly noteworthy. SCP-3478 is a strong idealist, believing in the values of justice, harmony, and equality. SCP-3478 tends to express these ideals in various ways, including protesting and boycotting. It is worth noting that SCP-3478's values are often skewed towards a more egalitarian worldview, and therefore these protests and boycotts are often directed at corporate entities perceived as prioritizing profits over people.

SCP-3478 is not to be underestimated. Despite its humanoid nature, it holds considerable power and influence within its company. Through the course of its employment, SCP-3478 has risen through the ranks of its organization, and as a result, possesses significant resources at its disposal.

SCP-3478 has on occasion displayed an abnormal level of self-reliance, which can prove problematic if used for malicious purposes. Nevertheless, SCP-3478 has consistently shown a willingness to comply with foundation personnel, making it manageable and of low risk.

Addendum: SCP-3478 remains a valuable asset to both its organization and Foundation, as the interests of both parties align. However, constant monitoring of SCP-3478 is necessary to prevent any potential anomalous activity.
