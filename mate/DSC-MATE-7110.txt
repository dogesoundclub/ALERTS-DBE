SCP-7110 is a peculiar specimen of the human race, displaying some unique features that set them apart from the rest. The subject serves as an electrician, performing tasks that deal with wires and electronics. However, their physical appearance may mislead one to believe that they're not an electrifying character at all.

SCP-7110 dons a recognizable Doge hat on top of their head, accompanied by a green cross earring that dangles from their left ear. If one is fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the subject's face, they may catch sight of their nerd glasses that seem to be a permanent fixture.

Their personality is what distinguishes them from the rest, as they tend to exude charm and charisma that makes them the life of the party. SCP-7110 will often crack jokes or do silly dances to amuse their colleagues, leading to some humorous situations.

One peculiar feature of SCP-7110 is their frightened mouth, which may indicate some underlying fears or anxieties that the subject may be experiencing. They also frequently wear a medical mask, which may be conducive to their chosen profession but could also imply some aversion to germs or other harmful agents.

Despite their humorous demeanor, SCP-7110 displays a level of professionalism that is indicative of their job, being skilled in handling electrical equipment and sensitive electronics. It's worth noting that SCP-7110 is often seen wearing a gold chain, though its purpose or significance is yet to be determined.

SCP-7110 is a fascinating specimen, and further observation may yield further insight into their unique characteristics.
