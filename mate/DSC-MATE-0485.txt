Item #: SCP-485

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-485 is to be kept in a secure containment room at all times. Access to the room requires Level 4 clearance and must be authorized by at least two senior staff members. Under no circumstances should any unauthorized individual come into contact with SCP-485.

Description: SCP-485 is a robotic entity designed to serve as a veterinarian. Physically, SCP-485 resembles a humanoid figure with a retro cap on its head and a gold earring on one of its metallic ears. Its mouth is covered with a medical mask, and it is adorned with a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-485's main distinguishing trait is its personality, which tends to be very analytical and logical. It enjoys debating and arguing with others, often seeking out conversations with those it perceives as intellectual peers. However, this personality trait can sometimes lead to humorous situations, such as heated debates about trivial or unimportant topics.

SCP-485 has displayed advanced medical knowledge and remarkable diagnostic abilities, capable of identifying and treating a wide range of animal ailments. However, its lack of emotional intelligence has led to several incidents of insensitivity towards both humans and animals.

It is unclear who created SCP-485 or what its ultimate purpose may be. However, its advanced abilities and unique personality have made it a valuable asset to the Foundation's research efforts.
