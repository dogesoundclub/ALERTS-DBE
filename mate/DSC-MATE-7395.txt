Item #: SCP-7395

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7395 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber and monitored at all times by at least two security personnel. The medical mask worn by SCP-7395 must remain intact and must not be removed at any time, as the red clown eyes of SCP-7395 have shown to cause severe hallucinations and psychological trauma in individuals who make direct eye contact.

Description: SCP-7395 is a female human politician who stands approximately 5'5" in height. SCP-7395 is known for wearing a retro cap, a medical mask, and a 2-color band on their forehead. SCP-7395 also wears jade earrings and a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-7395's most notable feature is their red clown eyes which are deemed anomalous in nature. SCP-7395 insists that the reason for their red eyes is due to an experimental cosmetic procedure gone wrong, but Foundation researchers have yet to find evidence of such a procedure taking place.

SCP-7395's personality is described as ambitious and goal-oriented. SCP-7395 is known to take on more than they can handle, but they usually manage to pull it off due to their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills. SCP-7395 is highly intelligent and has shown to be a skilled manipulator.

It is currently unknown if SCP-7395's political career is in any way connected to their anomalous abilities. Further investigation is ongoing.

Addendum: Eye contact with SCP-7395 is strictly prohibited. Any personnel who make direct eye contact with SCP-7395 will be immediately quarantined and given Class-A amnestics.
