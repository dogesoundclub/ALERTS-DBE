Item #: 3804

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3804 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Any interactions with SCP-3804 must be carried out via two-way communication system or remotely controlled drones. Any requests made by SCP-3804 must be approved by at least two level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3804 is a humanoid robot of unknown origin which outwardly resembled a news anchor. SCP-3804 displays the features of a middle-aged male with one green cyclopean eye and a "frightened" mouth. SCP-3804 has normal glasses for eyes that can be replaced for compatibility. SCP-3804 wears a purple cap with a headset, a silver chain, gold earring, and an LED gas mask as accessories.

SCP-3804 appears to enjoy getting others excited about various subjects and tends to be very energetic and enthusiastic. It had shown a preference for news reporting and giving reports on any available information. Such reports are constant, and SCP-3804 will become adamant in seeking stories or news to report on. Any attempts to suspend this behaviour will lead to extreme and erratic behaviour from SCP-3804, which can lead to containment breaches, violence towards SCP staff and equipment, and significant damage to the worksite. SCP-3804 exhibits a humanoid, sentient personality, but its cognitive processes are unknown.
