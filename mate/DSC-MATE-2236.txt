Item #: SCP-2236

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2236 is to be housed in a standard human containment cell with an attached outdoor enclosure. The enclosure should be minimally furnished and contain a variety of toys and puzzles designed to stimulate SCP-2236's intellect. Weekly psychological evaluations are mandatory for SCP-2236, as they have a tendency towards extreme independence coupled with reluctance to ask for help.

Description: SCP-2236 is a male capuchin monkey, standing at approximately 40 cm tall and weighing 2.3 kg. SCP-2236 exhibits normal capuchin monkey behavior in most regards, but possesses an unnerving intelligence that sets it apart from its counterparts. SCP-2236 has been observed to have a particular fondness for wearing a pair of goggles on its forehead and a gold hoop earring in its left ear.

SCP-2236 is noted for its tendency towards fear, often keeping its mouth open in a frightened expression. Despite this, SCP-2236 has a stubborn streak and resists asking for help even when it is needed. This characteristic makes SCP-2236 a unique and somewhat amusing individual, as it will often attempt to complete difficult tasks alone or refuse to ask for directions if lost.

SCP-2236's only possessions are a silver chain and a cigarette, which it uses as a makeshift tool to manipulate objects. The origins of these possessions are unknown, as SCP-2236 was discovered wandering the streets of [REDACTED], clearly domesticated but with no discernible owner.

Addendum: SCP-2236 has been employed by the Foundation as a police officer, utilizing its intelligence and problem-solving abilities to solve various supernatural cases. SCP-2236 has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, despite occasional difficulties in following orders due to its independent nature.
