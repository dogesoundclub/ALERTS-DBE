Item #: 261 

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 261 must be monitored at all times to ensure that they do not utilize their electrical manipulation abilities for malicious purposes. As a human, SCP-261 may come and go as they please, but are required to check in with Foundation personnel on a regular basis. 

Description: SCP-261 is a humanoid electrician possessing unique physical attributes that distinguish them from a normal human. They have orange stripes on their cheeks and lips, and their eyes are red clown eyes. SCP-261 also wears a tiara on their head, which may aid them in their electrical manipulation abilities.

On their forehead, SCP-261 has a two-color band and a goggle that is frequently pushed up when not in use. Gold earrings adorn their ears, and they wear a choker around their neck. SCP-261 is often seen smoking a cigarette, despite being aware of the health hazards associated with smoking.

SCP-261's personality is described as analytical and logical, with a quirky sense of humor. They enjoy making witty observations and teasing their friends in a dry, deadpan way. However, SCP-261's mood can shift quickly, and they have been known to become short-tempered and impatient when things do not go according to plan.

SCP-261 is capable of manipulating electricity, and has been observed charging and discharging devices with ease. It is speculated that SCP-261 may be able to control electrical currents on a larger scale, which could prove to be a potential threat if not monitored carefully.

Addendum: SCP-261 has expressed an interest in creating new electrical devices and technologies using their unique abilities. Further research is required to determine if this poses any additional risks.
