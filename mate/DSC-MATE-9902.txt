Item #: 9902

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 9902 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. Due to the unusual appearance of 9902, personnel interacting with them must be briefed beforehand on 9902's nature, and must not display any signs of amusement or hostility. 9902 is to be monitored for any signs of mental or physical distress, and a medic is to be alerted immediately if necessary.

Description: 9902 is a humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, possessing clear blue clown eyes that can be quite unsettling. 9902's head is that of a pink rabbit, and has a gold earring on each ear. A goggle is also permanently affixed to their forehead. While 9902's appearance is bizarre, they possess a commanding presence and radiate an aura of confidence and strength. Despite their rather boisterous and intimidating nature, 9902 is harmless in nature and has proved to be an effective security guard.

Personality: 9902 is a confident and headstrong individual, displaying a fearless nature that borders on reckless. They can come across as bossy or even domineering, as they possess a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to get the job done in the most efficient way possible. Despite their somewhat abrasive personality, 9902 is well-respected by their colleagues, who appreciate their unwavering dedication and passion for their job. However, caution is advised when approaching 9902, as they are liable to bark orders if they perceive others as not working to their full potential. 

Addendum: Although 9902's appearance may initially deter some personnel, it is imperative that they are treated with respect and professionalism. 9902 has proven themselves a valuable asset to Site-17, and their work ethic and competence should not be underestimated.
