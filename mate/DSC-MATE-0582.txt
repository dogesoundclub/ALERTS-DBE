Item #: SCP-582

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-582 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-582 is to be granted only with Level 3 clearance and higher. SCP-582 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of hostile behavior or any attempt to escape.

Description: SCP-582 appears to be a human male in his late 30s or early 40s, measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height. SCP-582 has a distinctive spot on his mouth that resembles a birthmark, along with a perpetually frightened expression that is believed to be related to a history of trauma.

SCP-582 is always seen wearing a bucket hat on his head and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, SCP-582 wears a medical mask over his mouth, presumably to conceal the spot on his lip. Finally, SCP-582 often accessorizes with a red scarf.

Personality: SCP-582 has a reputation for being a quick-witted individual who loves engaging in debates and arguments. Despite this tendency, SCP-582 is actually quite amiable and enjoys playful arguments with friends and family members. SCP-582's sense of humor is a valuable asset in any situation, often relieving tension and defusing difficult situations.

SCP-582's background and history are largely unknown, although it is believed that the trauma related to his frightened expression may be related to a past experience with the occult. As such, SCP-582 must be treated with extreme caution when engaging with other supernatural entities, as his past experiences may trigger violent behavior.
