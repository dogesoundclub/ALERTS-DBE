Item #: 5977

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5977 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit. Mistreatment or provocation of the subject is strictly forbidden unless deemed necessary by high-ranking staff members.

Description: Subject 5977 appears to be a male Tiger (Panthera tigris) standing at approximately 6 feet tall. Its most notable features include normal glasses, a red beanie, and a medical mask covering its mouth. On its forehead, there is a set of goggles and a red cross earring adorning both ears. The subject is also often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck.

In addition to its unique appearance, Subject 5977 has displayed a strong and decisive personality that can be perceived as bossy or intimidating. However, this behavior is interpreted as its desire to efficiently and effectively carry out its duties as a fast food worker.

Though the origins of Subject 5977 are unknown, the anomalous properties displayed seem to revolve around its physical form and personality traits. Researchers are encouraged to observe and interact with the subject to gain further insight, but all interaction must be performed with caution.

Discovery: Subject 5977 was discovered by chance during a routine inspection of a fast food establishment. It is unclear how it came into existence or how it came into contact with humans, but it has since then been contained by the SCP Foundation.

Addendum: It has been noted that Subject 5977 occasionally displays an unusual behavior where it will refuse to serve certain individuals for reasons unknown. This behavior is still being investigated.
