SCP Foundation Entry:

Item #: SCP-9879

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9879 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their tendency to engage in risky behavior, all staff are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-9879. Access to any large bodies of water in the vicinity of SCP-9879 is strictly prohibited for safety reasons.

Description: SCP-9879 appears to be a human male in his mid-twenties, approximately 6 feet tall. SCP-9879 exhibits distinctive traits such as orange stripes on his face and a red scarf as an accessory. Their eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED, and their head is covered with a hoodie while they wear a medical mask over their mouth. Despite these physical abnormalities, SCP-9879 is indistinguishable from a normal human.

SCP-9879 tends to act impulsively and enjoys taking risks. They engage in dangerous activities such as cliff diving in rivers or trekking through the forest without proper equipment. Despite these actions, SCP-9879 appears to have above-average physical abilities, making them capable of surviving such activities. Their spontaneous nature and risk-taking behavior have made them a difficult subject to manage and contain.

Addendum: SCP-9879 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after several civilians reported sightings of a humanoid figure with glowing eyes and strange facial markings jumping into a nearby river from a tall cliff. Foundation agents tracked down SCP-9879 and successfully contained them. Further investigation revealed SCP-9879's occupation as a real estate agent. As of now, no anomalous properties have been discovered in SCP-9879 other than their spontaneous and risk-taking behavior.
