Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1605 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with any necessary items for the comfort of DSC-MATE-1605. Personnel are strictly prohibited from interacting with DSC-MATE-1605 outside of approved testing protocols.

Description: DSC-MATE-1605 appears to be a male tiger in his late 20s to early 30s. DSC-MATE-1605's eyes are obscured by normal glasses, but appear to be hazel in color. DSC-MATE-1605's head is not arranged in any particular style, appearing to be a mess of green hair. Forehead feature #1 appears to be two thick bands of color that change in hue and saturation depending on DSC-MATE-1605's emotional state. Forehead feature #2 appears to be a set of goggles resting on DSC-MATE-1605's forehead, regardless of necessity. DSC-MATE-1605's ears are adorned with a jade earring, and his mouth is typically concealed by a medical mask. DSC-MATE-1605 is often seen wearing a red scarf as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-1605 displays a creative and artistic side with interests in various forms of expression such as painting, drawing, and writing. DSC-MATE-1605 has been observed to engage in these activities in his free time, often producing works that are highly regarded by DSC personnel.

DSC-MATE-1605's anomalous properties manifest in situations where DSC-MATE-1605 is in distress or under extreme emotional duress. During these times, DSC-MATE-1605's physical form will change, becoming larger, stronger, and gaining speed and agility far beyond what would be considered normal for his species.

Addendum: Testing has shown that DSC-MATE-1605 possesses intelligence and problem-solving skills far beyond that of a normal tiger, indicating the possibility of prior intelligence enhancement procedures. Further investigation is ongoing.
