DSC-MATE-3010 is known to have committed several criminal actions, most notably stealing high-tech equipment and data from advanced research facilities. DSC-MATE-3010 is highly intelligent and covert, making it difficult to track its movements and motives.

Addendum 3010-A: Following a containment breach in 20██, DSC-MATE-3010 was tracked to a small underground cave system in [REDACTED], where it was discovered to have built a makeshift workshop. Inside the workshop, DSC-MATE-3010 had several dismantled robotic units, technological devices and stolen research data. A message, addressed to the Foundation was found in the workshop, signed by DSC-MATE-3010:

"To the Foundation, I must apologize for my actions, but please understand that my intentions are pure. I am determined to use my skills for the betterment of society, and I believe that advanced technology can help us overcome the challenges of this world. Please consider working with me, for the greater good."

Several interviews were conducted with DSC-MATE-3010, and it expressed a desire to collaborate with the Foundation in technological development projects. The proposal was denied, citing DSC-MATE-3010's unpredictable behavior and potential for causing harm. DSC-MATE-3010 remains contained and monitored.
