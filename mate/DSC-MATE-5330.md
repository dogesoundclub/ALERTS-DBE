Item #: 5330

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5330 is to be allowed to continue her profession as a Traffic Officer, although her area of patrol should not exceed a radius of five kilometers from her assigned post. She must always have access to her preferred medium of learning (be it books, documentaries, or other resource materials). Access to the internet is allowed but monitored to avoid exposure to topics which might trigger the subject's anomalous properties.

Description: Subject 5330 appears as a female human in her mid-twenties, with striking orange stripes on her cheeks and purple lips. Her eyebrows are also orange, and her hairstyle and dressing resemble the 00s school girl era. She is often seen wearing a gold chain and a lit cigarette. Her ears sport dangling gold earrings.

Subject 5330's anomalous ability manifests through an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She spends an excessive amount of time immersing herself in books and other resource materials to gain obscure knowledge. She collects books and other educational materials with passion and zeal, which she shares willingly with others. Despite possessing a strong personality, Subject 5330 does not shy away from group learning.

When in close proximity to others, particularly a crowd or traffic snarl, orange and purple tendrils emanate from the subject's cheeks and lips. These tendrils carry bits of terrifying knowledge that are delivered directly into the individuals' subconscious thoughts, causing them to become aware of aspects otherwise unknown. After this encounter, the individual is likely to be curious about obscure topics and will have a stronger drive to continue learning.

Addendum: Subject 5330 is cooperative with routine testing procedures and demonstrates no signs of aggression or ill behavior. Further research into the full scope of the individual's anomalous properties is ongoing. No further action is necessary.
