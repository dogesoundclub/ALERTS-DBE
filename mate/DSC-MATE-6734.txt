Item #: SCP-6734

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6734 is to be contained within a standard humanoid cell at Site-██. Personnel assigned to SCP-6734 must have a strong sense of responsibility and be able to balance their workload effectively. SCP-6734 is allowed to keep its silver chain and candy stick at all times. Any attempts to remove these items will result in disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-6734 is a male human measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height. The subject wears a hoodie, which partially covers their face, revealing orange stripes on their cheeks. SCP-6734 carries a silver chain around its neck and frequently sucks on a candy stick. The subject identifies as a lawyer and displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility.

SCP-6734's abilities are currently unknown. The subject's behavior is consistent with that of a responsible and hardworking individual, often taking on more than it can handle. SCP-6734's attention to detail and dedication to its work are impressive, but it can lead to some humorous situations, such as attempting to carry too many items at once.

Addendum: During a routine examination, SCP-6734's silver chain was found to be anomalous. The chain appeared to be able to manipulate time, allowing SCP-6734 to complete tasks faster than normal. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of the chain's abilities. A request for testing has been submitted to Site Director ████.
