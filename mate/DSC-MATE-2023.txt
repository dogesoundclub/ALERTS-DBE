Item #: 2023

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2023 is to be allowed full freedom of movement within a designated area, so long as he is not outside the limits of his job as a train driver. SCP-2023 must wear a gas mask at all times while performing his duties, and is not to share any personal or identifying information with any non-Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-2023 appears, at first glance, to be an average human male with striking green hair and a purple cap. Upon closer inspection, SCP-2023's unique features become apparent. He has orange stripes on his face, and a pair of nerd glasses over his eyes. A pair of goggles is positioned on his forehead, and he wears a green cross earring on his left ear. In addition, he is often seen sporting a red scarf.

SCP-2023 possesses an extraordinary ability to connect with others, allowing him to create deep and meaningful relationships with those around him. His personality is characterized by a natural charisma that draws people to him like a moth to a flame, and he has a talent for putting people at ease. SCP-2023 often engages in conversations with strangers, eliciting personal stories or funny anecdotes that help bring people together.

It is worth noting that SCP-2023's gas mask is not a part of his normal outfit but is instead an additional accessory necessary for his containment. The exact reason for this requirement remains unknown but must be maintained to prevent any potential breaches of containment.

Addendum: SCP-2023's powers of persuasion have allowed him to become quite popular among Foundation staff. It is essential to remember, however, that despite his charming nature, SCP-2023 is still an SCP and must be handled with caution.
