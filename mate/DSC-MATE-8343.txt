Description:

SCP-8343 is a human female identifying as a Mafia boss. It is currently unknown how SCP-8343 obtained its position of power or its affiliation with any known Mafia organizations. SCP-8343 displays abnormal physical characteristics, including orange stripes on the face, red clown-like lips, and blue clown eyes.
