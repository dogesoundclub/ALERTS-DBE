Item #: SCP-9992

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9992 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be allowed free movement within the chamber to prevent it from becoming agitated or bored. SCP-9992 is to be provided with regular access to social events and entertainment media to maintain its mental health.

SCP-9992 is required to wear a medical mask at all times when not undergoing testing to prevent the spread of anomalies. Any unusual changes to SCP-9992’s appearance or behavior must be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-9992 is a female human of average height and weight with spots on her face and a constant smile. SCP-9992 has blue clown eyes and a face resembling that of a 00s school girl. It wears a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-9992 has a natural charm and charisma that allows it to be the life of any party. SCP-9992 often tells jokes and performs silly dances to make others laugh, leading to humorous situations.

SCP-9992's effects are mainly confined to its personality and appearance, with the only anomalous effect being the spontaneous manifestation of clown eyes. SCP-9992 is not considered dangerous and exhibits no hostility; however, its behavior and appearance can be unsettling to some individuals.

Addendum: Testing has shown that SCP-9992 is immune to most forms of mind control, making it a valuable asset in maintaining containment of other SCPs. Further study of SCP-9992's immune system and resistance to mind-altering effects is ongoing.
