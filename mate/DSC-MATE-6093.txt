Item #: SCP-6093

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6093 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to her human nature, no special containment measures are required. SCP-6093 is allowed to continue her job as an electrician under the guise of regular human employment. Agents assigned to her monitoring should blend in with her co-workers and keep close surveillance on her daily life.

Description: SCP-6093 is a female human with the unique characteristic of having orange stripes on her face and purple lips. Her eyes are bright orange and her retro cap is an accessory that she keeps on her head at all times. She wears a red cross earring and a choker for additional accessories. She displays an organized personality with a tendency to plan ahead but also has a surprising spontaneous side. Her spontaneous nature leads to humorous situations, often surprising her friends with unexpected adventures.

SCP-6093 has the ability to control any and all electrical devices with the power of her mind, as long as they are within a predefined range of approximately 1km. Her electrical manipulation has been observed to work on all forms of technology, including mobile phones, computers, and security systems. SCP-6093's ability is not harmful, but it is recommended that any electronic devices or machinery that agents carry on their person be kept a safe distance from SCP-6093 to avoid any mishaps.

SCP-6093 was discovered by the Foundation after her abilities were brought to light while conducting her job as an electrician. She displayed abnormal control over electrical devices, and her orange stripes and purple lips drew the attention of the Foundation. SCP-6093 willingly cooperated with the Foundation and was amenable to the terms of her containment.

Conclusion: SCP-6093 is a unique individual with exceptional abilities. Her organized tendencies and spontaneous nature present opportunities for a varied, interesting study. Observation of her daily life and her interaction with technology may lead to valuable insights or advancements in Foundation operations.
