Item #: SCP-2831

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2831 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to the nature of their abilities, SCP-2831 must be monitored at all times by at least two personnel. Any requests made by SCP-2831 must be evaluated before approval.

Description: SCP-2831 is a human female identified as a farmer. Their facial features include orange stripes, red lips, and orange eyebrows, with a distinguishing orange side of the head. The forehead contains a two-color band and a goggle on the forehead. SCP-2831 also wears a jade earring and a choker, along with a normal gas mask. Such features do not seem to impede their physical abilities.

SCP-2831 possesses a strong sense of independence and resists asking for help when needed. They exhibit a stubborn personality, refusing assistance when dealing with heavy lifts or following a map when lost. This tendency has resulted in humorous situations in the past. SCP-2831 seems to lack any significant anomalous abilities.

SCP-2831 is reasonably cooperative during interactions with personnel, aiding in the investigation of their abilities. SCP-2831 requests that their name be kept confidential; however, the origin of this request is unknown. Despite SCP-2831's desire for privacy, they seem to be communicative towards personnel, especially those they grow acquainted with.

Addendum: Testing with SCP-2831 has resulted in no significant discoveries. SCP-2831 simply appears to possess a strong sense of independence and stubbornness, with no anomalous abilities detected. SCP-2831 has requested that they be allowed to return to their farm, but this has been denied for their safety.
