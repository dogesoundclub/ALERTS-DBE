SCP-2174, also known as "The Manager", is a humanoid figure standing at approximately 6 feet in height with a prominent mouth spot that resembles a birthmark. The subject's eyes are concealed behind a pair of ski goggles, and their head sports a normal blonde hairstyle. The subject's ears have a piercing that holds a gold earring, and their mouth is often covered with a medical mask.

SCP-2174's job is that of a theatre manager, a position they have held for several years. According to reports, the subject's strong and decisive personality can be intimidating to those around them, which has earned them the nickname "The Boss".

SCP-2174's personality is best described as efficient and effective. They have no time for frivolous activities and are always focused on getting the job done. However, their strong will and no-nonsense attitude can come off as bossy or intimidating to those who do not understand their motives.

The subject is always seen sporting a gold chain as an accessory, though its significance is yet to be determined. Interestingly, SCP-2174 seems to have no anomalous abilities or characteristics and is entirely human, yet their appearance often causes confusion and unease in those around them.

Further research is required to determine the significance of SCP-2174's appearance and behavior, and any potential risks or benefits the subject may pose. As of now, they remain under observation and study by SCP personnel.
