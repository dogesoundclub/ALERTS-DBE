SCP-2188 is a humanoid rabbit entity with a penchant for salesmanship. The subject sports a purple cap with a headset and horned rim glasses. A red scarf wraps around its neck, providing a pop of color to the otherwise drab ensemble. A goggle rests on the Rabbit's forehead, mostly for show, although some staff believe it provides a tactical advantage in negotiations.

SCP-2188's most distinguishing feature is its frightened mouth that conveys an innocent vulnerability. However, staff must not be deceived by the Rabbit's outward appearance. The entity displays cunning salesmanship beyond compare, often convincing individuals to purchase vehicles they cannot afford.

SCP-2188's nurturing personality makes it an endearing entity, but it also extends to inanimate objects. The subject has a special connection to its car, an object that they have affectionately named Orange Crush. SCP-2188 is known to converse with plants and even household appliances, anthropomorphizing them in the process.

Although SCP-2188's primary job is to sell cars, some staff members believe that the entity has an ulterior motive. Further monitoring and investigation are needed to ensure that SCP-2188 does not have malevolent intentions.
