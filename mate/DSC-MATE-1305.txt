SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-1305

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1305 is to be contained in a reinforced steel cage measuring 10m X 10m X 10m at all times. The cage must be equipped with a gas dispersal system to release tranquilizers if necessary. The cage's interior is to be furnished with an artificial jungle habitat to ensure SCP-1305's comfort. Any personnel entering SCP-1305's cage must wear Level A hazmat suits and be equipped with a gas mask.

SCP-1305's criminal activities and influence must be monitored, and any attempts to expand its territory or power should be thwarted by Foundation agents.

Description: SCP-1305 is a male tiger hybrid with a blue bandana covering its head and jade earrings in its ears. It wears a red scarf around its neck and a gas mask over its snout. SCP-1305's most distinctive feature is its normal glasses, which it wears regularly. When questioned about its ability to see through the glass, SCP-1305 has remained unresponsive.

SCP-1305 is a notorious mafia boss in the urban fantasy world. It is famous for its goal-oriented and ambitious nature, which often leads it to undertake more than it can handle. Despite this, SCP-1305 is known for its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills, leading to it achieving impressive results. SCP-1305 is a fierce fighter, and despite being an animal hybrid, its mannerisms and communication styles are like a human.

SCP-1305's criminal empire encompasses vast territories and diverse businesses, including underground gambling parlors, nightclubs, weapon arms deals, and drug trading. SCP-1305's approach to handling its operations is brutal and unforgiving, and it is known for punishing traitors and insubordinates with utmost cruelty.

Addendum: SCP-1305 was successfully contained after a joint operation by the Foundation and the local authorities, resulting in the arrest of several of SCP-1305's men. SCP-1305's initial resistance was met with tranquilizers from the cage's gas dispersal system, leading to its successful capture. SCP-1305 currently resides at Site-██, and its continued containment is under review.
