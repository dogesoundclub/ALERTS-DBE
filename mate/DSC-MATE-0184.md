DSC-MATE-184 is a medical robot that has been modified to repair both machines and biologic entities. The green Cyclops eye gives him a unique appearance and his horned rim glasses give him a professorial appearance which conveys how smart and helpful he is in his job. His Doge hat, which is a reference to a meme, adds a touch of humor to his stern and serious appearance. The gold earring in his ear represents his love for music and also symbolizes his versatility.
 
While being practical and hands-on, DSC-MATE-184 uses unconventional ways to repair things, which may seem odd to others. His go-to tools are duct tape and paper clips that he uses for makeshift repairs or to rig up solutions. DSC-MATE-184's cigarette aside from being harmful also makes him look even more mysterious and enigmatic. 

He has a human-like personality and engages in conversations with the people he is helping. DSC-MATE-184's charm and ingenuity make him a valuable asset for solving complex medical problems, and his dedication to the craft of healing surpasses that of any other doctor or medical practitioner.
