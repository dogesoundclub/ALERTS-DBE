SCP-7936 is a Human designated as a Theater Manager, with unique features that stand out from the average human appearance. The subject's face boasts of distinctive Orange Stripes, while their luscious Red Lip adds a dash of sophistication to their personality. The eyes of SCP-7936 possess unusual Orange Eyebrow, which adds to the overall attractiveness of their countenance.

SCP-7936's head is adorned with a Rainbow Festival, which adds to the subject's enigmatic personality.

Adding to the overall radiance, SCP-7936's ears are host to Jade Earrings, perhaps indicative of the subject's love for jewelry.

However, despite their striking features, SCP-7936's personality can be somewhat impulsive, with the subject displaying a tendency to act before thinking things through.
