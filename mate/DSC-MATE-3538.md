Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3538 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with reinforced walls and a secure locking mechanism. Access to DSC-MATE-3538 is to be granted only by Level 2 personnel and above.

DSC-MATE-3538 is to be kept under constant observation for the first 72 hours after containment, due to its unpredictable behavior and tendency to act impulsively. Any instances of disruptive behavior are to be reported immediately and dealt with accordingly.

Description: DSC-MATE-3538 is a human male, standing approximately 1.9 meters tall and weighs approximately 100 kilograms. DSC-MATE-3538's most distinctive feature is the mouth spot, located just under the bottom lip. DSC-MATE-3538's eyes have been replaced with ski goggles, which appear to be surgically implanted into the eye sockets. DSC-MATE-3538 has a green cross earring in the left ear and is often seen wearing a normal gas mask.

DSC-MATE-3538 possesses a distinctive mohawk hair style and a goggle on its forehead. DSC-MATE-3538 has been diagnosed with a tendency to act impulsively, making it difficult to predict its behavior or actions. DSC-MATE-3538 often engages in reckless behavior, which may lead to minor accidents or mishaps.

DSC-MATE-3538's reckless nature, combined with its unique appearance, often leads to difficulties in social situations. DSC-MATE-3538 tends to try to impress others with its actions, leading to instances of inappropriate behavior.

DSC-MATE-3538 was originally contained due to its job as a security guard, which exposed it to potentially dangerous situations. Its unpredictable behavior and tendency to act impulsively made it unsuitable for employment in that role.

Addendum: Since containment, DSC-MATE-3538 has been relatively cooperative and has not displayed any significant aggression or disruption. However, due to its unpredictable behavior, it is important that DSC-MATE-3538 be monitored at all times. Any changes in its behavior or actions should be reported to a Level 2 or higher personnel immediately.
