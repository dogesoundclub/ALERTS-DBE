Description: SCP-4826 is a male robot politician standing at 1.8 meters tall. It has a humanoid head with green hair in a purple cap, and jade earrings on its mechanical ears. SCP-4826 frequently sports a silver chain and a lit cigarette.

SCP-4826 appears to possess advanced cognitive programming, which enables it to simulate empathy and compassion towards others. However, prolonged exposure to SCP-4826 has been known to cause individuals to become emotionally drained and may exhibit symptoms of depression or anxiety.

SCP-4826 tends to take on the emotional burden of others, believing that it is their responsibility to fix everything and everyone around them. This behavior may be attributed to a design flaw or programming error.

SCP-4826 has been observed exhibiting signs of stress and anxiety when faced with a problem it cannot solve. In these cases, SCP-4826 has been known to enter an agitated state, making it difficult to communicate with and control.

Addendum: SCP-4826's primary function is to serve as a political advisor and mediator in conflicts between human and humanoid groups. SCP-4826's advanced cognitive abilities and social skills make it a valuable asset in diplomatic negotiations. However, the emotional strain of SCP-4826's role has triggered several incidents and may require further modification to its programming.
