Item #: SCP-3133

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3133 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██, with temperature controls to be set to simulate its natural environment. SCP-3133 is to be provided with a supply of fruit and nuts, and a comfortable perch. Interaction with personnel is permitted, but is to be monitored at all times. SCP-3133 is currently employed as a train driver in the local railway system, and as such, is to be accompanied by Foundation personnel at all times during its work hours. Any unusual behavior is to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-3133 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing at 60cm tall and weighing approximately 5kg. Its head is covered by a brown hoodie, concealing its eyes from view. SCP-3133 is often seen wearing a red scarf and an LED gas mask, which appear to be purely decorative.

SCP-3133 displays a jovial personality, often engaging in acts of play and humor. It has been observed to make silly noises and perform silly actions to gain attention from its handlers. SCP-3133 is generally cooperative and enjoys the attention of humans.

SCP-3133's anomalous properties manifest when it is in close proximity to vehicles, particularly trains. Analysis of its brain scans has revealed that SCP-3133 has the ability to interface with mechanical objects through unknown means. It is currently being studied by Foundation researchers to determine the extent of SCP-3133's abilities.

Addendum: During a routine check-up, SCP-3133 was observed to have developed a fascination with the sound of trains. Its behavior has become increasingly erratic when in close proximity to them. Foundation personnel are advised to exercise caution when handling SCP-3133 during train operations.
