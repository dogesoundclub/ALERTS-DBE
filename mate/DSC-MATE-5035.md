Item #: 5035

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5035 is to maintain a low profile and continue their daily job as a fast food worker. Any unusual behavior or manifestation of their suspected psychic abilities is to be reported immediately to the containment team. DSC-MATE-5035 is permitted to wear their standard uniform as long as it is kept in good condition.

Description: DSC-MATE-5035 is a human male with various distinct features. The most notable is a series of dark spots that cover their entire face, resembling a skin condition known as pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Their eyes are protected by ski goggles at all times, and they wear an earring in the shape of a green medical cross. The top of their head is adorned with a high-quality doge hat, and a silver chain dangles from their neck. DSC-MATE-5035's mouth is covered by a medical mask, almost as if they were anticipating viral infection. Reports indicate that they dress in this manner to compensate for their apparent sensitivity to external stimuli.

DSC-MATE-5035 presents with a wide range of sensory abilities, including heightened intuition that often borders on precognition. They are rumored to have telepathic abilities and may sense other people's emotions or predict future events. Despite their unusual abilities, DSC-MATE-5035 maintains a passive personality and does not engage in aggressive or violent behavior.

Addendum: Prior to DSC-MATE-5035's containment, several reports of strange occurrences in the surrounding area strongly suggested their involvement. Agents embedded in local law enforcement were able to identify DSC-MATE-5035 through video surveillance, and they were subsequently apprehended in their workplace. The details of their abilities and origin are still under investigation.
