ID # : DSC-MATE-5035
Description: DSC-MATE-5035 is a human male with various distinct features. The most notable is a series of dark spots that cover their entire face, resembling a skin condition known as pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Their eyes are protected by ski goggles at all times, and they wear an earring in the shape of a green medical cross. The top of their head is adorned with a high-quality doge hat, and a silver chain dangles from their neck. DSC-MATE-5035's mouth is covered by a medical mask, almost as if they were anticipating viral infection. Reports indicate that they dress in this manner to compensate for their apparent sensitivity to external stimuli.
