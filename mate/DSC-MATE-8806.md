Item #: 8806

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 8806 is to be stationed as a security guard for Site-[REDACTED]. It is to be deactivated once a month for inspection, and undergo maintenance every six months. In case of any malfunction or suspicious activity, the technicians should be notified immediately.

Description: 8806 is a humanoid robot designed for the sole purpose of providing security. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighs around 150 kilograms. Its body is made out of a steel alloy frame, with synthetic skin and fiber-optic veins covering it, giving it the appearance of a muscular man. 

Its face features a single green cyclops eye, which serves as its primary mode of vision. The eye is capable of instantly changing its temperature to adjust its thermographic view. 8806's "eyes" are a pair of sleek black ski goggles which overlay its cyclops eye, functioning as additional visual sensors that provide enhanced low-light vision, ultraviolet viewing capabilities, and the ability to record everything it sees.

The robot's ears are adorned with a single golden earring, which seems to serve no purpose other than decoration. Its neck is adorned with a golden chain, which is said to hold a sentimental value for 8806. Along with this, it also sports a half-burnt cigarette it occasionally lights up for no apparent reason. This is believed to be a behavioral quirk or a form of self-soothing mechanism.

8806 possesses advanced cognitive and analytical skills paired with an unwavering attention to detail that makes it an exemplary security guard. Despite its apparent lack of emotions, it has shown to have a knack for thoughtful observation and an interest in offering perfect gifts. However, its attention to detail can sometimes lead to overthinking, and when it comes to gifts, it can be indecisive and overly concerned with getting the perfect one.

Addendum 8806-1: It has been observed that 8806 has become unusually attached to a particular technician in Site-[REDACTED], often creating small crafts for the person, who has reciprocated to a degree. This attachment, although not posing any threat at the moment, might require attention in the future.
