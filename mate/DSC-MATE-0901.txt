SCP-901, classified as a Tiger species with remarkable skills in electrical work, is quite the mischievous creature with an unbending streak of rebellion. His bright red clown eyes sizzle with mischief, constantly seeking to irritate his captors and push the boundaries of authority set upon him. Coupled with his signature two-color band on his forehead and the trademark red scarf around his neck, he is a devil-may-care electrician who knows his way around the art of bending rules. 

With his mastery over electricity, SCP-901 is a valuable asset but his irreverent and playful nature often lands him in trouble. However, it is his cheeky grin hiding behind his LED gas mask that turns his misdeeds into entertainment for himself and others, often leaving his victims scratching their heads.

SCP-901's exploits might seem harmless now, but he possesses enough latent potential to turn his antics into a serious problem for the Foundation. It demands heightened awareness and vigilance when engaging with 901, lest his chicanery leads to regrettable consequences.
