Item #: SCP-7727

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7727 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its occupation as a doctor, each medical examination is to be conducted by a qualified medical professional. Access to SCP-7727 requires Level 2 clearance and must only be granted for medical examinations or authorized research. All personnel must follow proper biohazard and infection control procedures when interacting with SCP-7727.

Description:

SCP-7727 is a male, anthropomorphic rabbit standing at approximately 1.5 meters in height. It possesses blue clown eyes, and its head is adorned with a police cap which bears no identifiable indication of affiliation with any actual law enforcement agency. Its forehead features a two-color band, and a gold chain is worn around its neck.

SCP-7727's most notable trait is its natural talent for leadership, often assuming control in high-pressure situations in various aspects of its life, including but not limited to its work as a medical professional, social gatherings, or even its personal life.

SCP-7727 is friendly and approachable, but exhibits signs of stress when its leadership capabilities are not utilized. This agitation can sometimes lead to disruptive behavior and may pose a danger to others if not properly managed.

Addendum:

SCP-7727 came to the Foundation's attention through a hospital report detailing the unusual traits exhibited by the hospital staff's "resident rabbit doctor." Upon initial observation, SCP-7727 demonstrated a high degree of intelligence, organizational skills, and the ability to understand and utilize complex medical procedures with ease. These qualities, combined with its unusual appearance, led to its containment for further research.
