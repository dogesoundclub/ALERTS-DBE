Description: 

6166 appears to be a male human of indeterminate age, standing at 6 feet tall with an average build. The most notable feature on their face is the presence of various spots across the skin. Their eyes are replaced with virtual reality rainbow LED lenses, which seem to have a hypnotic effect on those who make eye contact with them for prolonged periods of time. They wear a monk's hood over their head and a shining golden earring, both items appearing to be of some significant religious or spiritual importance to the wearer.

Addendum: It has come to the attention of the foundation that the playful side of 6166 can cause unpredictable behavior if left unchecked. It is highly advisable to keep all communication and interactions with 6166 professional and to avoid engaging in non-essential conversations or activities.
