Item #: SCP-8431

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8431 is to be monitored at all times and is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-8431 is allowed to conduct its job as a real estate agent outside of Foundation grounds, provided it follows all protocols regarding information displacement and does not expose itself or its activities to the public.

Description: SCP-8431 appears to be a typical human female with spots covering its face and a pair of purple lips. Its eyes are also unique, possessing orange irises and eyebrows. The subject's head is of a witch's short cut, and it has a two-colored band on its forehead. Additionally, there is a pair of goggles resting on top of the band.

SCP-8431 is often seen wearing a choker around its neck and a jade earring on each ear. Despite its peculiar appearance, the subject's supernatural qualities are limited, and it has shown no hostility towards Foundation personnel.

SCP-8431's personality is that of an absent-minded and forgetful individual, though it is generally amicable towards others. This quirk has led to several humorous situations, such as forgetting appointments or missing significant events.

Addendum: SCP-8431's unique appearance and interpersonal skills have proven useful in gathering potential human subjects for further study. Research personnel are encouraged to contact the subject when necessary.
