Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #3559 is to be kept in a soundproof containment chamber at all times. No personnel are allowed to enter the room without proper clearance from Level 4 personnel.

Description: Item #3559 appears to be a male Bengal tiger dressed in formal attire commonly associated with politicians. It is distinctively different from other tigers due to the two sets of nerd glasses he wears, indicating his fondness for books and knowledge.

Item #3559 also has a frightened mouth, giving the impression that he is always anxious, notwithstanding his glasses, golden earring, and silver chain. A normal gas mask is always kept visible around his neck. He wears a blue bandana, creating a fashion statement that distinguishes him from all other tigers.

Item #3559 is unique in that he is known for his love of adventure and taking risks in his personal life compared to his fellow tiger kind. Many humorous stories exist about him, including surviving near-death experiences when bungee-jumping or getting lost in the wilderness. 

Personnel are advised to keep physical contact with Item #3559 as minimal as possible. Any actions perceived as threatening will elicit unpredictable and intricate reactions. 

Item #3559 is most dangerous when trusted. Befriending it will lead to unexpected betrayal resulting in unpredictable and often catastrophic consequences.

Addendum: Item #3559 was recovered from a political party rally in India after it singlehandedly dismantled the entire stage, leading to five fatalities and millions in damages.
