Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5135 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted to accommodate a creature of feline physiology. CCTV monitors are to be placed in the chamber for scrutiny of the subject. Any individuals transmitting positive psychic signals are to be barred from entering the chamber perennially. DSC-MATE-5135 is to be given work as an on-site mechanic, which will provide a sense of purpose and reduce the likelihood of unwanted actions.

Description: DSC-MATE-5135 is a tiger male measuring 2.2 meters in length, with notable differences than non-anomalous animals. DSC-MATE-5135's eyes are free of any pigmentations manifesting a blue clown-like appearance. DSC-MATE-5135 has gold earrings on each of his ears and wears a Doge hat at all times. His mouth is concealed by a medical mask for the purpose of hiding his accentuated dentition. DSC-MATE-5135 also bears a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-5135 exhibits a strict adherence to established traditions and routines, perhaps owing to the influence of the significant tiger population in his homeland. It is postulated that even following contact with the human race, DSC-MATE-5135 has preserved a deep respect for his feline heritage, which is why he refuses to be considered anything but a tiger. Despite his toughened persona, DSC-MATE-5135 has a mischievous side, shown by his playful humor and fondness for recounting items that have been transmitted throughout his clan over varying generations.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5135 has been a model employee since arriving at the Site, prioritizing his duties and working diligently to maintain all mechanical equipment. DSC-MATE-5135's connection with the local tiger community seems to have compensated for his lack of contact with humans, making him a cooperative and refreshing presence around the site.
