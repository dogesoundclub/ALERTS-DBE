Item #: 8004

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8004 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a bed, desk, and clothing storage. The room must be kept free of any and all technology, as SCP-8004 has a tendency to manipulate electronic devices to their own whims. Any personnel entering SCP-8004's containment chamber are to be accompanied by two armed guards at all times.

Description: SCP-8004 is a humanoid robot resembling a human doctor. SCP-8004 stands at approximately 1.8 meters in height and has ski goggle-like eyes and a headset with a LED light. SCP-8004 is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle around its neck.

SCP-8004's personality is characterized by a deep curiosity about the world and a love of learning about obscure or unusual topics. They have an insatiable thirst for knowledge that often leads them to research esoteric and even arcane subject matter. SCP-8004 has a penchant for randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, which can be humorous or distracting in certain situations.

SCP-8004's capabilities are still being studied. However, SCP-8004 has demonstrated a remarkable understanding of anatomy, pharmacology, and other medical fields. SCP-8004 is also able to interface with electronic devices and has been known to manipulate them to its own advantage.

SCP-8004 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel but has been known to become hostile or uncooperative when asked to perform tasks that it deems beneath it.

Addendum: SCP-8004 is not to be taken lightly, regardless of its friendly and inquisitive demeanor. SCP-8004's potential should not be underestimated, as it possesses intelligence far beyond that of a human doctor. Personnel are advised to stay alert and cautious when dealing with SCP-8004.
