Item #: 2949

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject should be treated as a standard human and allowed to function within society as an ordinary citizen. Strict monitoring is not necessary, however, a bi-annual check-in is required to evaluate any anomalous activity.

Description: Subject 2949 appears to be a human female of average height and weight. She possesses striking facial features, including orange stripes and red lips. The subject also has orange eyebrows and a short, witch-like hairstyle. A distinctive feature of 2949 is her use of a cigarette, which she is often seen smoking.

Personality: The subject displays an affable and gregarious personality, often offering creative ideas and outlandish solutions to problems. 2949 is a natural brainstormer who thoroughly enjoys coming up with new and creative concepts. However, such behavior can lead to humorous, even chaotic, situations. 

The subject's profession as a firefighter is fitting, given her ability to think quickly and act decisively in high-pressure situations. Her unique thought processes could also prove valuable in problem-solving for the containment of anomalous entities, making her a potentially valuable asset to the Foundation.

Overall, subject 2949 appears to be a fairly ordinary human, albeit with some distinct aesthetic characteristics and tendencies. Her anomaly lies primarily in her creative thinking and problem-solving abilities, though her use of cigarettes may raise concerns for her overall wellbeing.
