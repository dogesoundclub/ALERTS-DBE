Item #: 4997

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4997 must be kept in a reinforced steel cage, with a locking mechanism set to require a fingerprint and a retinal scan to open. Any interactions with the item must be supervised at all times by trained personnel.

Description: Item 4997 is a male tiger, standing approximately 6 feet tall on its hind legs. The creature wears a pair of nerd glasses, with a distinctive two-color band across its forehead. Its mouth is covered by a medical mask, which appears to be surgically attached to the creature's face. Item 4997 is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck.

Personality: Item 4997 possesses a practical and hands-on personality, often using unconventional methods to fix problems. It is known to use duct tape or paper clips to repair broken objects, and can create makeshift solutions to issues that others may find too complicated. The creature is highly intelligent and is capable of rational thought, often demonstrating exceptional problem-solving skills.

Risks: Item 4997 is a dangerous entity, capable of causing serious injury or death if left unchecked. Its strength and agility far surpasses that of a normal tiger, and is capable of breaking steel restraints with ease. Additionally, the creature's intelligence and creativity make it unpredictable, and it has been known to manipulate its surroundings to gain an advantage.

Notes: Item 4997 was discovered after a series of savage attacks on a local law firm. Witnesses reported seeing a large, tiger-like creature with glasses and a scarf fleeing the scene. Foundation personnel were able to track the creature down and capture it. It was later discovered that Item 4997 was, in fact, a human who had undergone a dangerous experimental procedure to merge with a Bengal tiger, resulting in its current form. Further experimentation must be carried out to determine the extent of the creature's abilities and limitations.
