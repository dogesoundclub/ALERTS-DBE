Description: SCP-5132 appears to be a male robot with normal glasses and a short peak cap. It is noted to wear a goggle on its forehead and a red cross earring. SCP-5132 also accessorizes with a gold chain and an LED gas mask.

SCP-5132 is a reliable and organized lawyer, however, it is observed to be stubborn and resist change. The creature has an inflexible nature and a hard time adapting to new situations or ideas. SCP-5132's unyielding attitude can lead to humorous situations when confronted with unexpected situations or challenges.
