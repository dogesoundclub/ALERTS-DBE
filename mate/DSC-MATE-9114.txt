Item #: 9114

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9114 is to be monitored during working hours, and any deviations from their normal behavior or personality are to be reported immediately. SCP-9114 is currently employed as a fast-food worker at a Foundation-approved establishment, and their job performance is to be evaluated regularly. SCP-9114 is allowed to interact with civilians as long as they do not show any signs of anomalous behavior.

Description: SCP-9114 is a human female with orange stripes on their face and orange hair on the side of their head. They have a two-color band on their forehead and jade earrings on their ears. SCP-9114 wears a medical mask over their mouth and a silver chain as an accessory. 

SCP-9114 displays a unique personality trait of being highly observant and detail-oriented. This trait makes them excellent at gift-giving, as they tend to pay close attention to the recipient's interests and preferences. However, SCP-9114 can become anxious and overthink while choosing the "perfect" gift, sometimes causing distress.

Addendum-1:

SCP-9114 was recruited by the Foundation after a spy reported their unusual gift-giving talents. Testing in SCP-9114 revealed no anomalous abilities or influences, leading to them being classified as Safe. SCP-9114 was then offered a job at a Foundation-approved establishment, providing them with a place to channel their gift-giving skills and live a healthy life outside of containment.

Addendum-2:

SCP-9114 has shown no signs of malicious intent or behavior, and their interactions with civilian customers have been reported as satisfying and efficient. SCP-9114 remains cooperative and approachable with Foundation personnel, significantly reducing the risk of any abnormal activity.
