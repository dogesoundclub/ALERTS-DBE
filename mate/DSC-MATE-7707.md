Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7707 is to be allowed access to all necessary equipment and facilities required for her occupation as a news anchor. DSC-MATE-7707 is not to be interrupted during her broadcasts unless in the event of an emergency or the occurrence of an anomalous event. All relevant broadcasts are to be monitored and recorded for analysis. DSC-MATE-7707 is not to be approached by Foundation personnel outside of scheduled interviews or debriefings.

Description: DSC-MATE-7707 appears to be a human female in her mid-30s, standing at approximately 5'6" with a slender build. The subject's most notable feature is her orange eyebrow lenses, which emit a dim glow in low-light situations. DSC-MATE-7707's head has been replaced with a metal blue prosthetic, which allows for a wider range of facial expressions and greater articulation when speaking.

Attached to DSC-MATE-7707's prosthetic is an LED gas mask, which covers her nose and mouth during broadcasts. The mask emits a white light during broadcasts to obscure DSC-MATE-7707's facial features and maintain her anonymity. The subject is able to breathe normally through the mask due to an advanced air filtration system.

DSC-MATE-7707 is well-known for her quick wit and love of debate, often engaging in playful arguments with friends and colleagues. Despite her friendly demeanor, the subject is highly ambitious and driven to succeed in her profession. DSC-MATE-7707's anomalous properties are limited to her unique appearance and the prosthetic enhancements to her head.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7707 has expressed interest in interviewing other anomalous subjects in the future, but permission for such interviews must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-7707's previous interviews with Foundation personnel have been cooperative and informative.
