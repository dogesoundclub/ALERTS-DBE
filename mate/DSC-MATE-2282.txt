The chamber's entrance is to only be accessed by Level 3 personnel or above, and all personnel interacting with SCP-2282 must wear Class-B hazmat suits at all times.

SCP-2282 is to be provided with food and water regularly, and is allowed access to books and other passive forms of entertainment. Any requests made by SCP-2282 must be approved by the Site Director or Deputy Director. SCP-2282 is allowed to continue its work as theater manager, provided that events are held in a secure location and attendees are screened for anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-2282 is a human female of indeterminate age, approximately 5'5" in height and weighing approximately 65 kg. Its skin is pale and its facial features include a pronounced purple lip and red clown eyes. SCP-2282 appears to favor wearing a hoodie that obscures its head and forehead, which features a two-color band.

SCP-2282 exhibits highly charismatic behavior, and is able to connect with individuals on a deep level. It has demonstrated the ability to draw strangers to it, engendering a strong sense of camaraderie among those it interacts with. Its behavior can lead to confessional moments or the sharing of humorous anecdotes, causing strangers to bond easily. SCP-2282 does not appear to be capable of influencing individuals towards dangerous actions, and has not exhibited any malicious intent.

SCP-2282 also possesses the ability to generate SCP-2282-1, a form of contagious entity that has been observed to spread from its body during moments of heightened emotional states, such as laughter or sorrow. SCP-2282-1 manifests as a formless, translucent cloud that moves slowly and dissolves upon contact with any object or person.

SCP-2282-1 has been shown to have the side effect of heightening empathy and generating a sense of connection among individuals exposed to it. SCP-2282-1 does not appear to be dangerous to individuals, although prolonged exposure has been shown to cause anomalous effects in some individuals.

Addendum: SCP-2282 was recovered by Foundation personnel from a small theater in ████████, where it was working as a theater manager. SCP-2282 was entranced in a performance of "Hamlet" when it was escorted out by Foundation personnel. It has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and is considered to be low-risk.
