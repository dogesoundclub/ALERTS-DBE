Item #: 7094

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The subject must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any interaction with the subject must be kept to an absolute minimum, and only with approved personnel wearing appropriate protective gear.

Description: DSC-MATE-7094 is a female human with distinctive spots on their skin. They are frequently seen wearing a bucket hat and a gold chain, along with a normal gas mask for protection. Their forehead has a unique two-color band marking, and their ears are adorned with green cross earrings.

The subject's personality is characterized by an intense attention to detail, often taking their fixation to obsessive levels. This trait has been known to manifest in everyday situations, such as alphabetizing their spice rack or color-coding their closet. Despite this, DSC-MATE-7094 has shown an ability to adapt and think quickly on their feet, particularly when it comes to planning and executing acts of villainy.

Although the subject is classified as human, their behavior and capabilities suggest a heightened level of agility and strength that is atypical for typical humans. It is suspected that the subject may have undergone experimental enhancements or have occult powers that allow them to operate outside the normal parameters of human ability.

Note: DSC-MATE-7094 is considered highly dangerous and must be approached with extreme caution. Any breach of containment could result in serious consequences for Foundation personnel and the general public.
