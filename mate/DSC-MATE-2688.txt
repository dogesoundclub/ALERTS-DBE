SCP-2688 is a middle-aged human male, identified by his distinctive facial feature of a permanently frightened mouth. His eyes are embedded in ski goggle-like structures that are affixed to his head with apparent surgical precision. The head itself is adorned with a curious peak spike, which protrudes from the scalp with metallic precision. SCP-2688's ears are further adorned with a jade earring, seemingly made from a single piece of polished jade.

SCP-2688's peculiar physical appearance is only matched by his unusual personality traits. He is highly introspective and prone to losing himself in daydreams and deep reflections, often leading him to walk into obstacles and trip over his own feet. Despite this chronic absent-mindedness, SCP-2688 is a highly effective car salesman, often closing deals with even the most skeptical buyers.

SCP-2688's psychological state remains a mystery to researchers, but it is clear that his introspective tendencies may be linked to his anomalous physical traits. Further research and analysis are necessary to determine the extent of his supernatural abilities and their implications for containment measures.
