Item #: SCP-2175

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2175 is to be contained in a specialized enclosure equipped with VR-compatible technology to reflect its unique sensory preferences. All personnel that enter the containment chamber must be equipped with VR Rainbow LED goggles.

SCP-2175 is to be fed twice a day with its preferred diet of fruits, nuts, and seeds. SCP-2175 is also allowed to smoke cigarettes, but only within the designated smoking area within its enclosure.

SCP-2175's enclosure must be monitored 24/7 for any changes in its behavior or physical condition. Any deviations from normal behavior must be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-2175 is a male monkey that appears to be a hybrid of several monkey species. Its most notable feature is its VR Rainbow LED eyes, which change color and pattern depending on SCP-2175's mood. SCP-2175's head is adorned with a bucket hat and a red scarf, while it is often seen with a cigarette in its hand.

SCP-2175 exhibits a natural charm and charisma that allows it to interact effortlessly with others. Its personality is similar to that of a stereotypical "funny guy," with SCP-2175 often cracking jokes and doing silly dances to make others laugh.

SCP-2175's anomalous properties manifest in its ability to influence the luck of those around it. Individuals who interact with SCP-2175 often find themselves experiencing strokes of good luck, including winning lotteries, receiving promotions, or experiencing unexpected blessings. Conversely, SCP-2175's influence can also result in strokes of bad luck for those who anger or upset it.

Addendum: SCP-2175 was discovered working as a banker in a local branch of █████ Bank. Foundation agents were alerted to SCP-2175's anomalous properties when a sudden influx of good luck occurred within the bank's customer base. SCP-2175 was subsequently contained without incident.
