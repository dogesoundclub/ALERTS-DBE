Item #: 3455

Object Class: Human

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3455 is to be allowed to continue her work as a veterinarian, under the guise of a normal human. All interactions with humans outside of her role as a veterinarian are to be monitored and any breaches of containment protocols are to be reported immediately. 

Description: Subject 3455 is a female human with a comically infectious smile that can disarm even the most hardened of individuals. She is marked with various spots on her face, reminiscent of a wild animal, but her eyes are what set her apart: they are a bright orange color with eyebrow-shaped markings above them. 

On her forehead, subject 3455 wears a set of goggles that she claims help her see "the world in a different light." She also often sports a pair of jade earrings and a gold chain around her neck. 

Her personality is that of a restless and curious mind, constantly seeking out obscure facts and trivia. This has led to some rather humorous situations where she may randomly blurt out information that is out of context or not relevant to the conversation at hand. 

Despite her quirky nature, subject 3455 is highly skilled in her profession as a veterinarian and is highly dedicated to her work. She is also known to frequently smoke cigarettes, even in locations where it is prohibited, which has caused some issues with her containment. 

Overall, while subject 3455 does not exhibit any paranormal abilities, her quirky traits and love of obscure knowledge make her an interesting individual to interact with. However, containment protocols must be strictly followed to avoid any potential breaches.
