Description: 5938, also known as "The Robot Boss," is a male robot adorned with a green cyclops eye, horned rim glasses and a doge hat. Its ears are pierced with a red cross earring on the left. To the untrained eye, 5938 looks just like any other mafia boss, but it is far from human.

Personality: Despite its ruthless reputation in the underworld, 5938 is often lost in thought, daydreaming, and can be the butt of a few humorous situations. Its introspectiveness and lack of emotional recognition in any situation can make it unpredictable and dangerous. Hence, it demands absolute loyalty and respect from its subordinates.
