Item #: 9627

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9627, a humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with minimal decor. No electronic devices are allowed within subject's chamber, as it's capable of using such devices to hack and cause disruption. The use of an EMP pulse generator in the event of an escape attempt is recommended.

Description: Subject 9627 is a humanoid of average height and build, with a distinctive orange striped pattern on its face, specifically around the mouth area. The subject is often seen smiling which often triggers a smile response to any present personnel, similar to DSC-999 upon eye contact. Subject has observable VR jade LED eyes which often follow the eye movement of others in response. The head is adorned with a decorative green cross earring and a full mohawk. Additionally, a pair of goggles is often visible on the forehead, which it uses to view invisible matrix walls.

Subject 9627 exhibits traits of responsibility and duty to its job as a banker. However, it also balances both work and play. The subject's humor is a striking contrast to the serious demeanor of bankers, leading to humorous situations like dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor at social events. Its gregarious and outgoing personality make it amenable to various types of social interaction. 

Given the proclivity to hack into systems, Subject 9627 is closely monitored and secured under high-level surveillance. Any attempt of escape from containment will be met with immediate action from the security team. 


Addendum:
The use of 9627 as D-class personnel is not recommended as the subject's abilities to hack and manipulate systems are not yet fully understood. Any attempts to use the subject in an experiment with electronic devices are not authorized.
