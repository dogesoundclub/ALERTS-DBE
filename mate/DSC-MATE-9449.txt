SCP-9449 even goes as far as to clean the containment chambers of any objects under its care and making sure they are always in good condition. 

SCP-9449 has expressed its desire to be more "human-like" and is interested in experiencing more human-like emotions. However, due to its current containment, SCP-9449 is not allowed to have physical contact with any humans. 

Addendum: SCP-9449 requested a "pet" in its containment chamber. After careful consideration and testing, the request was approved. SCP-9449 was provided with a non-sentient plush toy, which it has named "Buddy." SCP-9449's mood seems to have improved since receiving the toy.
