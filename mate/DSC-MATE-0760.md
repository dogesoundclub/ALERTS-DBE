Item #: DSC-MATE-760

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-760 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber with minimal furnishings. Access to the chamber is to be restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. DSC-MATE-760 is to be provided with a red scarf and a whistle at all times. In the event of DSC-MATE-760 showing signs of distress or agitation, the whistle is to be used to summon security personnel immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-760 is a male monkey-like creature, standing at 1.2 meters tall. Its fur is primarily brown, with black and white markings on its face and limbs. The creature's eyes are currently unknown due to its refusal to allow examination.

DSC-MATE-760 is frequently observed wearing a Doge hat and a red scarf, and is known to carry a whistle at all times. The creature has been identified as having a strong sense of independence, which can on occasion hinder its cooperation with Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-760 is capable of communicating fluently in English, French, and Hungarian, and is reportedly a trained doctor in the latter language. Despite this, DSC-MATE-760 is often reluctant to ask for help when necessary, leading to humorous situations where the creature will attempt to accomplish tasks independently, despite the odds being against it. DSC-MATE-760 has been noted to be hesitant to use maps or other navigational aids when lost, preferring to rely on its own intuition.

DSC-MATE-760 has been observed to have a playful and curious nature, often trying to interact with nearby personnel through gestures and play. However, it should be noted that this should not detract from its potential for danger, as DSC-MATE-760 has been known to exhibit aggressive behavior towards those it perceives as a threat.

Addendum: Incident 760-1 - On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-760 was found to have escaped its containment chamber for unknown reasons. Security personnel were dispatched to recapture the creature, but encountered significant resistance from DSC-MATE-760 using its knowledge of the facility's layout to evade capture. After several hours, DSC-MATE-760 was eventually found attempting to navigate a vent system, and was subdued using tranquilizer darts. Following an examination, it was determined that DSC-MATE-760 had caused minimal damage to the facility during its escape attempt. Further security measures have been put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
