Item #: 6163

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6163 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a secure ventilation system. Access to DSC-MATE-6163 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher, and all interactions must take place through a secure communication system.

Description: DSC-MATE-6163 is a male veterinarian and a member of the Oryctolagus cuniculus species, commonly known as a rabbit. DSC-MATE-6163 stands approximately 1 meter tall when fully upright and weighs approximately 25 kilograms. DSC-MATE-6163's face is distinguished by a permanently frightened expression which it often tries to conceal through the use of a normal gas mask. DSC-MATE-6163 also wears horn-rimmed glasses and a police cap, along with a gold earring in its right ear.

DSC-MATE-6163 exhibits a natural talent for leadership, frequently taking charge of situations both in its professional and personal life. Despite its small stature, DSC-MATE-6163 possesses a commanding presence that often inspires those around it to follow its lead. DSC-MATE-6163 is able to communicate fluently in English and has demonstrated an above-average intelligence for its species.

DSC-MATE-6163's anomalous properties manifest when it is exposed to stress or danger. In unknown ways, DSC-MATE-6163's body is capable of producing a powerful pheromone that induces feelings of courage and determination in those around it. This effect has been observed to be more potent on individuals of the human species, and studies have shown that prolonged exposure to DSC-MATE-6163's pheromones can result in altered behavior and increased aggression in affected individuals.

DSC-MATE-6163's containment was prompted by an incident in which it activated its anomalous effects while performing a surgery on a human patient. Personnel present at the time reported feeling an intense sense of determination and fearlessness, causing erratic behaviors among them. DSC-MATE-6163 was subsequently detained and transferred to a Foundation facility for further study.

Addendum: Dr. █████, DSC-MATE-6163's primary researcher, has made several attempts to determine the source of DSC-MATE-6163's anomalous effects. Thus far, all tests have been inconclusive, and further research is needed to understand the mechanism behind DSC-MATE-6163's pheromone production.
