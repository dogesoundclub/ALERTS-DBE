SCP-423 is a sentient rabbit with a rebellious streak that makes him unpredictable and difficult to handle. The subject is easily recognizable by his signature blue bandana, jade earring, and horned rim glasses, as well as the gold chain and LED gas mask that he often wears to enhance his edgy appearance.

As a delivery driver, SCP-423 shows a considerable level of skill and responsibility. However, his strong sense of independence and disdain for authority often lead him to act out of line, taking unauthorized breaks or flouting the rules whenever he sees fit.

SCP-423's personality is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the intricate interplay between his animal instincts and human-like intelligence. Despite his unruliness, the subject displays a remarkable level of empathy and intuition, often able to sense danger or deception before anyone else.

While SCP-423 may come across as aloof or nonchalant, his actions are driven by a deep sense of purpose and conviction that often eludes most humans. Whether he is smuggling goods across the city or evading capture from the authorities, SCP-423 always acts with a sneaky cunning that constantly keeps his handlers guessing.
