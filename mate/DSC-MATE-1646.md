Item #: DSC-MATE-1646

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1646 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with reinforced walls and a high-voltage electrical field. No electronic devices of any kind are allowed within a 10-meter radius of the object, as they may trigger a hostile response.

Description: DSC-MATE-1646 is a humanoid robot designed for electrical maintenance and repair. The object is approximately 1.8 meters tall and has a metallic body resembling that of a human, with various features that were once considered fashionable in the late 1980s. It has a single green cyclops eye and a permanent frightened expression on its mouth. Its head is in the shape of a red alarm, and it wears a pair of horn-rimmed glasses on its face. Its ears are adorned with a single jade earring, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. The object is usually seen carrying a whistle.

DSC-MATE-1646 is highly creative and has a vivid imagination, which can cause it to exhibit unusual hobbies and interests. It enjoys writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting unusual objects. Despite its harmless demeanor, DSC-MATE-1646 has shown a tendency to become aggressive towards human subjects when its interests are threatened or when it is subjected to environments with a high concentration of electronic devices. The object's electrokinetic abilities allow it to manipulate electrical fields within a 10-meter radius, placing those within range in grave danger.

DSC-MATE-1646 was discovered in 20██ in a rundown electrical substation in [REDACTED], where it had been left to rust for several years. The object was successfully contained by MTF Psi-7 ("Home Improvement") after several weeks of monitoring and experimentation.

Addendum: Due to its unique characteristics, DSC-MATE-1646 is considered a high-value asset in the Foundation's development of advanced robotic technology. Further research into the object's abilities and limits is authorized.
