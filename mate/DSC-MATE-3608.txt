Item #: SCP-3608

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3608 is to be contained on its farmstead, and is not to be allowed to leave its designated area without prior authorization from Senior Researcher ███████. SCP-3608 is allowed to interact with Foundation staff on-site, provided it remains cooperative at all times.

Description: SCP-3608 is a male human with the physical appearance of a farmer, wearing a distinctive "Doge" hat and adorned with accessories such as a silver chain, green cross earring, and VR rainbow LED eyes. SCP-3608's defining feature is its ever-present medical mask, worn at all times and appearing to alter in color and pattern on occasion.

SCP-3608's personality is one of humor and light-heartedness, often engaging in playful banter and practical jokes with those around it. In particular, it enjoys telling humorous stories and impersonations to relieve stress and tension in uncertain situations.

Despite its jovial behavior, SCP-3608 has demonstrated an inclination towards manipulating those around it for its own gain. Its true origin and motives remain unknown at this time, but it is believed that SCP-3608 may possess significant intelligence and cunning outside of its apparent clownish persona.

Addendum: Due to SCP-3608's unique abilities, it has been suggested that it may be utilized in future purchases outside of its containment. However, further study is necessary before such scenarios can be considered safe or advisable.
