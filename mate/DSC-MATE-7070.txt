Item #: SCP-7070

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7070 is to be contained within a reinforced, 3x3 meter steel cell located at Site-██. Extra care must be taken to ensure that SCP-7070's containment remains secured at all times, as the subject has been known to exhibit aggressive tendencies towards staff.

Description: SCP-7070, also referred to as "the Rabbit Mechanic," is a male rabbit that stands at approximately 1.2 meters in height. SCP-7070 is identifiable by its signature "Doge" hat worn upon its head, along with a jade earring on each ear, a silver chain around its neck, and a candy stick within its mouth.

The most prominent aspect of SCP-7070's personality is its practicality and knack for hands-on work. SCP-7070 has been observed using unconventional and makeshift methods to fix various objects and machines, often utilizing materials such as duct tape and paper clips in its repairs.

Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, SCP-7070 has exhibited aggression towards personnel on several occasions, particularly when its ability to fix or tinker with machines is inhibited. It has been known to use its formidable teeth and claws to attack any perceived threat to its work.

Addendum: Due to the nature of SCP-7070's abilities, the subject has been deemed too dangerous for field work and is to be kept in strict containment at all times. Any attempts to engage with SCP-7070 outside of its containment chamber must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.
