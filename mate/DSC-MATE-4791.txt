Description: Agent 4791 is a human female with distinctive orange stripes on her face, complemented by a red lip and orange eyebrows. She is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset and sporting gold earrings and chains. While her appearance may be unusual, her personality is what makes her stand out. Agent 4791 is highly organized and efficient, sometimes to the point of being controlling. She is known to take charge of group projects and events, delegating tasks in a very matter-of-fact way. This behavior can lead to humorous situations, but caution should be taken when dealing with her.

Personality: Agent 4791's efficiency is often appreciated in her line of work, but her tendency to take control may be off-putting to some. She has shown to be resourceful and quick to adapt, which could be an asset in certain situations. However, her organizational skills may be a front for a more sinister motive. Further investigation is required to determine if she poses any threat to the public.

Note: Agent 4791's unique appearance may draw unwanted attention, especially from those who are aware of the existence of paranormal beings. It is highly recommended that she be kept under close observation in case she attracts any unwanted attention.
