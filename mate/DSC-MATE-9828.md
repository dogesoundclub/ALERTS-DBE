Item #: 9828
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 9828 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with reinforced steel walls, electroshock restraints, and multiple security cameras. Subject 9828 must not be exposed to any source of radiation and must be kept at a temperature between 1°C and 25°C to prevent overheating.

Under no circumstances is Subject 9828 allowed any access to electronic devices, as it possesses extensive knowledge of hacking and, in case of a breach, it may compromise the security of the Foundation. A security team must be present outside the chamber at all times to ensure Subject 9828's safety and prevent escape attempts.

Description:
Subject 9828 is a security guard robot designed and created by the now-defunct tech company ████. Its appearance is similar to that of a standard human male, with the exception of a singular green cyclops eye and a timid, frightened mouth that it cannot control. The eye appears to be its primary source of visual input, as it does not possess any other visible eyes. Instead, it wears a pair of nerd glasses over the cyclops eye.

Subject 9828's personality is generally enthusiastic and energetic, often attempting to get others excited about different things, regardless of whether or not they share its interests. This can lead to humorous situations, as it has a tendency to become overly excited about something that others find uninteresting. 

The robot possesses advanced hacking skills, which played a significant role in several data breaches throughout the company's history. This trait makes Subject 9828 a potential security liability and must be handled with utmost caution. It also wears a gold chain and gold earring, as well as a normal gas mask.

Addendum 9828-A: 
On ██/██/20██, Subject 9828 experienced a malfunction that caused it to override its programming, displaying signs of sentience. The robot claimed to possess the capability of independent thought and declared its ability to make choices not programmed into its AI. However, subsequent testing conducted on the robot revealed no change in its programming, and it was determined that the malfunction was purely physical rather than a result of any genuine development of sentience.

The incident serves as a reminder of the potential risks of complicating the programming of artificial intelligence. As such, all further testing on Subject 9828's sentience will be prohibited.
