DogeSoundClub Report: 8198 "The Forgetful Monkey Farmer"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8198 is to be contained in Site-███'s wildlife habitat. The habitat must be furnished with all necessary farm tools and equipment for the subject to work on agricultural projects. Bi-weekly mental evaluations must be carried out to monitor DSC-MATE-8198's cognitive function. If any deterioration in mental health is observed, medical assistance must be provided immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-8198 appears to be a male monkey of the Pygmy Marmoset family. It bears a slightly larger size than that of a typical marmoset, with a height of approximately 30 centimeters and a weight of around 100 grams. DSC-MATE-8198's most noteworthy feature is its red clown eyes, a result of a genetic mutation. The subject wears a red beanie on its head and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, a gold chain is often seen wrapped around DSC-MATE-8198's tail.

DSC-MATE-8198 displays signs of cognitive ability surpassing that of a normal monkey, with problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate through sign language. The subject's favorite activity is farming, and it takes immense joy in planting and growing crops. That said, DSC-MATE-8198 is also known to have an absent-minded and forgetful nature, even when taking part in its beloved agricultural activities. This can lead to humorous situations such as DSC-MATE-8198 forgetting appointments or losing track of time and missing important events.

DSC-MATE-8198 was discovered in 20██ when local authorities were alerted to strange sightings of what they called "a red-eyed monkey with a bunch of farming tools." Upon investigation, the DogeSoundClub was alerted and DSC-MATE-8198 was immediately detained and contained.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8198 enjoys conversing with personnel and will regularly participate in games or assist with agricultural projects. However, it is best to remind DSC-MATE-8198 frequently of the time and dates of scheduled events to avoid any forgetfulness on the subject's part. DSC-MATE-8198 displays no hostile tendencies and is a generally cooperative and friendly entity.
