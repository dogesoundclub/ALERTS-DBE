Item #: SCP-999

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-999 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no less than 12 square meters of space to allow for comfortable movement. A single shelf is to be provided for the storage of books and educational materials. SCP-999 is to be fed a diet consisting of bananas, apples, and other fruits on a daily basis.

Description: SCP-999 is a male monkey of the Capuchin species, standing at a height of approximately 70 centimeters. SCP-999's head is adorned with a police cap, a red scarf, and an LED gas mask. The gas mask appears to serve no functional purpose and has been observed to light up in various colors at seemingly random intervals.

SCP-999 possesses a strong thirst for knowledge and will often spend long periods of time reading and researching obscure topics. They have a particular fondness for books on history and mythology. SCP-999 is also an avid collector of educational materials, and has amassed a significant collection of documentaries and other media.

Despite their love of learning, SCP-999 is very social and enjoys spending time with others. They are friendly and have a playful nature, often engaging in humorous pranks on their caretakers. SCP-999 has been observed to be an excellent manager, particularly in the realm of theater production.

SCP-999 is a reliable actor and performer, with the ability to memorize dialogue and perform physical stunts. It is not yet known how they obtained these skills, as no records of their past have been discovered.

SCP-999 is an overall friendly creature and is great for morale purposes. The residents adjoining SCP-999's chamber have reported an uptick in general good cheer when SCP-999 is in the vicinity. SCP-999 has also shown interest in developing relationships with different SCP entities, such as SCP-682, SCP-035, and SCP-173, but all attempts have been declined. 

SCP-999 is allowed to roam the facility at specific times and under the supervision of the caretakers. While in captivity, SCP-999 expresses words of appreciation towards The Foundation for providing them with a comfortable environment to live in.
