SCP-3199, also known as "The Fashionista," is a humanoid entity of the species Human that works as a fashion designer in the heart of the city. This anomalous individual stands out due to their striking and somewhat unnerving appearance, with their red clown eyes and medical mask covering their mouth. SCP-3199's head is adorned with a blonde ushanka, which adds to their eccentricity.

Despite their penchant for fashion, SCP-3199 can be a bit reckless and impulsive. They often act before thinking things through, which can lead to humorous situations such as minor accidents or mishaps. SCP-3199 is a flamboyant character who enjoys showing off and impressing others. They are rarely seen without their choker, which has become somewhat of a signature accessory. 

Caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-3199, as their impulsiveness and desire for attention may cause unpredictable behavior. It is recommended to approach with caution and to keep a safe distance, lest you become caught up in their antics.
