Item #: SCP-376

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-376 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-376 must be conducted through a two-way mirror, due to its effects on those who make direct eye contact. Under no circumstances is SCP-376 to be allowed any object with which it can show its nurturing tendencies, as they may lead to unintended consequences.

Description: SCP-376 appears as a male human, with metal purple skin that appears to be fused onto his body. Its eyes are blue clown eyes, which seem to radiate an unnatural light. Furthermore, SCP-376 always wears a medical mask, covering what would be its mouth. SCP-376 is a successful beautician, able to create unique designs and styles on the hair and skin of humanoid entities. Despite its abilities, SCP-376 seems to prefer inanimate objects, often naming them and treating them as if they were pets.

SCP-376's primary anomaly is that it has the ability to imbue inanimate objects with life, giving them personalities and abilities beyond what their non-living nature should allow. SCP-376 has admitted to seeing "spirits" inside objects that it imbues, giving them life. These sentient objects have been observed to help SCP-376 with various tasks, communicating with SCP-376 through an unknown means. Testing with these objects has revealed that they continue to function even when separated from SCP-376, with some expressing a desire to rejoin it.

Despite its ability to bring life to objects, SCP-376 is docile and poses no immediate threat to personnel. It has shown immense loyalty to the Foundation, likely due to the interaction and care it receives from those entrusted with its containment.

Addendum: Testing has revealed that prolonged eye-contact with SCP-376 can cause strong emotional reactions in individuals. These effects have varied between those exposed, but have consistently manifested as strong attachment to objects and a desire to personify them. It is recommended that all personnel refrain from eye-contact with SCP-376 unless necessary.
