Item #: SCP-5535

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5535 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. As a human, she requires no additional restrictions beyond the usual. However, access to gift-giving situations must be monitored as SCP-5535 has a tendency to overthink, causing her mental instability.

Description: SCP-5535 is a humanoid female identified as a theater manager. She possesses a unique appearance with her purple lip, orange eyebrows, and unarranged green hair. Two horizontal color bands are imprinted on her forehead, with a cross-shaped green earring on each ear. SCP-5535 wears a standard surgical mask, which may indicate a germaphobic tendency.

SCP-5535's most notable feature is that she has an extreme ability to observe details. She is an excellent gift-giver, but her desire for perfection and overthinking ability causes her to experience anxiety in social situations. SCP-5535 is very sensitive and empathetic to others, often causing her to go to great lengths to ensure that everyone is content.

Addendum-5535-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/████, SCP-5535 was exposed to an unidentified gift that caused her to express an extreme version of her gift-giving anxiety. SCP-5535 was found to be obsessively searching for 'the perfect gift,' even attempting to acquire objects outside of Foundation stock. SCP-5535 began to disregard personal needs, claiming that her search was for their 'greater good.' This activity continued for 3 days, even though normal activities were still being conducted. SCP-5535 was mandated therapy, which was successfully able to soothe her and contain her compulsive behavior.
