ITEM #: 6575

OBJECT CLASS: HUMANOID

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

Subject 6575 is to report daily to local authorities and is to follow all rules and regulations set forth by their department. Any deviation from protocol will result in immediate removal from duty and placement in our custody.

DESCRIPTION:

Subject 6575 is a male, human police officer with spotted facial features and corrective eyewear. The subject's head is enveloped in green layers, which we initially suspected to be a form of camouflage, but further analysis revealed no abnormal effects.

The subject's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, they also have a lighthearted side that often leads to humorous situations. They have been known to engage in impromptu dance parties and singing competitions, and are often the life of the party.

Subject 6575 carries an accessory in the form of a cigarette, which appears to be a source of comfort and stress relief for them.

ADDENDUM 6575-1:

Subject 6575 has displayed a remarkable ability to diffuse tense situations with humor and wit. This talent has earned them the respect and admiration of their peers and has contributed significantly to their success as a police officer.

However, it is important to note that the subject's tendency to prioritize entertainment over safety could lead to dangerous situations. Therefore, it is imperative that they exercise caution and focus on their duties at all times. Failure to do so may result in reclassification to a more severe object class.
