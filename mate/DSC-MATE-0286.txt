Item #: SCP-286

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-286 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no access to any sharp or dangerous objects. Any visitors must first be properly screened and approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-286 is allowed limited contact with animals under supervision for research purposes only.

Description: SCP-286 is a female human identified as a licensed veterinarian. She stands at approximately 5'6" in height and weighs around 145 lbs. SCP-286 has distinct orange tiger stripes on her cheeks and a permanent smile on her face. Her eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and she frequently wears a blonde ushanka on her head with a jade earring on her left ear.

SCP-286 has been observed to wear a medical mask frequently while around others, citing concerns for hygiene purposes. She also often wears a gold chain around her neck as an accessory. She has been noted to be introspective and spends a lot of time lost in thought or daydreaming, which can lead to humorous situations and accidents.

SCP-286's anomalous properties manifest when she is in close proximity to animals. She exhibits an abnormal level of empathy and understanding of animal behavior, which has led to successful treatments and positive outcomes with animals suffering from physical or psychological conditions. However, prolonged exposure for SCP-286 to larger, more dangerous animals has resulted in increasingly erratic behavior, leading to several violent incidents.

Addendum: Due to SCP-286's unique abilities, it has been decided to use her talents primarily for research purposes. Any requests for animal treatments or consultations must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel, and all interactions must be carefully monitored for any potentially dangerous situations.
