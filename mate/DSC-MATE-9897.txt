SCP Identification number 9897 designates a highly dangerous and cunning individual. This villainous entity takes on the form of a majestic and ferocious tiger, with piercing and calculating eyes that peer out from underneath its horned rim glasses. Atop its head sits a police cap, a symbol of authority that it wields with malicious intent.

One of the most striking features of SCP-9897 is the two-color band that stretches across its forehead, representing the dichotomy that exists within its persona. Despite its nefarious intentions, this creature possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which makes it all the more dangerous. It is known to use its imposing presence to intimidate and coerce others into doing its bidding.

The enigma that is SCP-9897 is further compounded by the fact that it dons a medical mask, giving it an appearance of a dutiful caregiver. This facade, however, is nothing more than a smokescreen, hiding the true nature of this malevolent tiger.

While SCP-9897 is generally regarded as a ruthless and merciless foe, it does have a fun-loving side. It is not uncommon to witness this creature's surprisingly impressive dance moves or silly antics on the dance floor during social events. This duality is what makes SCP-9897 an especially formidable adversary.

Under no circumstances should anyone attempt to engage with SCP-9897. This entity must be dealt with using extreme caution and all available resources. If encountered, immediately contact your local SCP Foundation agent for further instructions.
