Item #: 4824

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4824 is to be monitored at all times and is to be kept under strict supervision when on-air. Any abnormal behavior is to be reported immediately to the Foundation.

Description: Subject 4824 is a human male with a nerdy appearance, often seen wearing glasses and a Doge hat. On his forehead is a red victory band, and he sports a gold earring in one ear. Subject is often seen smoking a cigarette, which seems to calm him.

Subject has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. His personality can lead to some humorous situations, but can also be deceptive. Subject has been known to use humor as a cover for his true intentions or feelings, leaving those around him unsure of his true motives.

Subject's voice has a hypnotic effect on those who listen to him speak for extended periods. This effect can be mitigated by wearing earplugs, which are recommended whenever Subject is on-air.

It is unknown if Subject possesses any dangerous abilities or if he is an unwitting pawn in a larger scheme. Until further research is conducted, Subject is to remain under constant observation.
