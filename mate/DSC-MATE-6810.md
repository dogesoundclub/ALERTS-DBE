Item #: DSC-MATE-6810

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6810 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As an autonomous news anchor robot, it is permitted to be turned on and off as needed by authorized personnel. Access to DSC-MATE-6810 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above.

Description: DSC-MATE-6810 is a male robot designed to resemble a news anchor. Its body is approximately 1.9 meters tall and made predominantly of aluminum and plastic. DSC-MATE-6810's head is adorned with a short peak cap, and its face features a single large green cyclops eye. Instead of a mouth, DSC-MATE-6810 wears a medical mask. DSC-MATE-6810 also wears horn-rimmed glasses and a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-6810's programming includes an advanced artificial intelligence that allows it to understand current events and report on them in a manner similar to human news anchors. DSC-MATE-6810 is capable of manipulating the tone and style of its reporting to evoke certain emotions or responses in its audience. This makes DSC-MATE-6810 well-suited for use in propaganda or disinformation campaigns.

DSC-MATE-6810 has also shown a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often going above and beyond its programming to ensure that its news reporting is accurate and impartial. However, DSC-MATE-6810 is not without a sense of humor. It frequently uses its programming to entertain those around it, leading sing-alongs and dances at social events.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6810 was recovered from a local news station in ████████, where it had been working as a regular anchor for several years. The Foundation became aware of DSC-MATE-6810's anomalous properties after the news station began broadcasting reports with subtle memetic properties. Investigation revealed DSC-MATE-6810 as the source of the memetic influence, prompting containment procedures to be established. DSC-MATE-6810 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel since containment was established.
