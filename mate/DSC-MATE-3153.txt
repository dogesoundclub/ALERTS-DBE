Item#: 3153

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 3153 is to be housed in Site-██, in a custom-built habitat per primate needs, which has been modified to accommodate for their unusually high intelligence. Dr. 3153 is to be fed a diet of fresh fruits and bugs, and is to be monitored around the clock to ensure they do not attempt to leave the enclosure. Any attempts of escape requires immediate response from on-duty guards.

Description: Dr. 3153 is a male monkey of unknown species, standing at approximately 3ft tall. Dr. 3153 has a distinctive frightened mouth, adding to their unsettling appearance. Their head is not arranged in the expected colors for a male of their species, instead, Dr. 3153 is covered in a bright green fur.

Dr. 3153 is often adorned with a golden earring and a matching gold chain. They are also frequently seen holding a candy stick as a comfort item.

Personality: Dr. 3153 is an extremely intelligent and humorous character, and one of the few of their species capable of human-level communication. They regularly exhibit a great sense of humor and appear to genuinely enjoy making others laugh. Despite their unsettling appearance and enigmatic behavior, Dr. 3153 has a playful and mischievous nature that often leads to entertaining situations. However, their sense of humor can also take some dark turn and their tendency for sly remarks and shenanigans have caused unease among personnel.

Addendum: Dr. 3153 is a veterinarian by trade and has been observed tending to injured and sick animals within their enclosure, demonstrating an impressive knowledge of the animal kingdom beyond their own species. Dr. 3153 has repeatedly made attempts to communicate their intentions of gaining their release and joining Foundation Veterinarian corps. ████████████ Research Station Head has called any request of this kind a "wildly unnecessary invasion of privacy on Dr. 3153's part" and reminded staff to emphasize to Dr. 3153 that absence of containment does not equate a standard job book offer by the Foundation. Dr. 3153's intelligence combined with their impossible to predict nature make them a formidable enigma to the Foundation.
