Item #: SCP-9184

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9184 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The subject must be provided with farming equipment and allowed to farm within his cell under the supervision of at least one security personnel.

Description: SCP-9184 is a humanoid of the male gender belonging to the Homo sapiens species, with distinctive facial features of multiple spots and a frightened mouth. The subject also possesses blue clown eyes and a doge hat on the head, with a two-color band on the forehead and a green cross earring on the ears. The subject is always seen holding a candy stick as an accessory.

SCP-9184 has a unique personality that displays signs of rebelliousness and boundary-pushing behavior. The subject finds amusement in breaking rules or bending them to see what happens, which has led to several humorous situations in the past. Although SCP-9184 can be unpredictable, the subject has shown no violent or dangerous behavior.

SCP-9184 has been employed as a farmer and allowed to farm within his cell using standard equipment. The subject displays proficiency in agricultural practices and has been successful in growing crops that have been used in Foundation cafeterias. Due to SCP-9184's pacifist nature, there have been no attempts to escape or harm Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-9184 expressed interest in creating an experimental crop and has requested to be provided with additional resources to conduct research. The request has been approved by Site-███ personnel, and SCP-9184 will be monitored closely during the experiment.
