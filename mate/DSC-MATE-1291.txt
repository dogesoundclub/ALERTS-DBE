SCP-1291 is a humanoid entity identified as a train driver, assigned to the ████████ subway station. Although appearing as a regular human, SCP-1291 displays unique physical features including distinctive spots around her face, especially around the nose and chin, and a pair of striking blue Clown Eyes. However, what sets SCP-1291 apart from regular humans is her purple lips that emit a faint glowing aura, visible even under well-lit conditions. SCP-1291 is usually seen wearing a tiara on her head, complemented by a jade earring on each ear.

SCP-1291's personality traits are an exceptional combination of intelligence, empathy, and compassion. SCP-1291 tends to go out of her way to help and support others, often taking their troubles onto her own shoulder. Due to her overwhelming empathetic nature, SCP-1291 sometimes gets intensely affected by other's problems, leading to emotional exhaustion. SCP-1291 wears a medical mask on her face at all times, indicating a possible history of medical complications.

SCP-1291's presence is visible to humans and poses no imminent threat to their lives. However, due to SCP-1291's unique physical features and empathetic nature, it is essential to monitor her interactions with humans, especially those exhibiting signs of distress. Any unusual phenomena associated with SCP-1291 should be reported immediately to the assigned containment team.
