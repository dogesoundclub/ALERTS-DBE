Addendum: DSC-MATE-5872 was recovered and brought into Foundation containment following multiple reports of unusual gifts appearing during various gift-giving occasions in the general public. The Foundation was alerted to the possibility of DSC involvement due to the extraordinary nature of the gifts and the level of obsessive attention to detail involved in their creation.

DSC-MATE-5872 demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel, thus resulting in its designation as a Safe class DSC. It has since received job placement as a mechanic at Site ██, where its skills are utilized in maintaining the site's machinery and equipment.
