Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4050 is to be monitored remotely via security cameras installed in all train cars that he operates. In the event SCP-4050 deviates from his assigned schedule, security personnel are to track his whereabouts and redirect him back onto his route using a pre-determined set of signals.

SCP-4050 must not be allowed to exit his designated train at any point during his shift. Should SCP-4050 attempt to leave the train, security teams will deploy non-lethal force to contain him until he is refocused on his duties and resumed his route.

Description: SCP-4050 is a sapient rabbit wearing a gold chain. SCP-4050 is physically no different from an average domestic rabbit in both size and shape, standing at approximately 25 centimeters in height and 1.5 kilograms in weight. SCP-4050 has a fur coat that shows no visible signs of aging or wear.

SCP-4050 possesses the intelligence and ability to read, write, and understand human speech. SCP-4050 has demonstrated proficiency in driving various types of trains and shows a great deal of enthusiasm and dedication to his job.

SCP-4050 has a scatter-brained personality which often leads to forgetfulness and distraction. Should SCP-4050 become sidetracked, he may deviate from his assigned route and become lost. SCP-4050 is incapable of returning to its route without external guidance.

SCP-4050 is not hostile and exhibits no violent tendencies. However, if SCP-4050's focus is diverted during its job, it may cause a potential safety hazard to passengers aboard the train.

Addendum: SCP-4050 has shown no signs of aging or deterioration over the course of several years. Testing to determine the reason for this effect is ongoing.
