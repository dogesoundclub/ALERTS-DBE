Item #: DSC-MATE-9332

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9332 is to work as a train operator exclusively on urban railway lines. DSC-MATE-9332 is to be fitted with a GPS tracking device and is not to be allowed to deviate from predetermined routes. Any deviation must be reported to the nearest Foundation facility immediately. All train cars operated by DSC-MATE-9332 must be equipped with tamper-proof security cameras.

DSC-MATE-9332 is not to be allowed access to nuclear, biological or chemical agents or weapons. In the event of a containment breach, lethal force is permitted.

Description: DSC-MATE-9332 is a male rabbit species approximately 132cm in height when upright. DSC-MATE-9332 has the appearance of a mid-20th century train engineer, wearing a retro cap and ski goggles. The goggles sometimes used as a forehead accessory. DSC-MATE-9332 also wears an LED gas mask that obscures its facial features.

DSC-MATE-9332 is highly analytical and logical, possessing a dry and deadpan sense of humor. They also enjoy making witty observations and practical jokes, often to the detriment of their co-workers. DSC-MATE-9332 has shown no interest in pursuing romantic relations.

DSC-MATE-9332's anomalous properties manifest when operating trains. DSC-MATE-9332 has the ability to manipulate and control the movement of railway cars without the use of conventional controls. DSC-MATE-9332 can also detect faults in machinery on sight, and can repair them by merely touching them.

DSC-MATE-9332 has displayed an exceptional capacity to remember train schedules and can recall the individual names of thousands of regular commuters. However, DSC-MATE-9332 is indifferent to the suffering of passengers, and will not hesitate to prioritize the continuity of railway schedules over passengers' welfare.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9332 was discovered in a train depot in rural Michigan, responding to a call from railway workers about an "unusual rabbit operating a train." The train was transporting a shipment of hazardous waste en route to Detroit. The Foundation intercepted the train and apprehended DSC-MATE-9332. DSC-MATE-9332 has been compliant throughout its containment, and its cooperation has allowed for significant advancements in urban rail technology.
