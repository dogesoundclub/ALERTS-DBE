Description: Subject 3935 is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on his face. The subject also possesses unusual ski goggle-shaped eyes that are unlike any other human's. The subject's head has normal blonde hair and ears adorned with a green cross earring. Additionally, the subject is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck and smoking a cigarette.

Despite his unusual appearance, subject 3935 does not appear to have any anomalous abilities. However, the subject's seemingly normal demeanor masks a deep-seated nurturing personality that leads him to care for others as if they were his own family. This tendency can lead to humorous situations, as the subject will often go to great lengths to care for friends or family members, even if it means putting himself at risk.

It is currently unknown how subject 3935 acquired his unusual appearance, but it is believed to be the result of an unknown magical artifact or creature. Despite this, the subject appears to be completely unaware of his unique characteristics and continues to live his life as a regular lawyer.
