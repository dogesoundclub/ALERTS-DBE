Item #: SCP-56

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-56 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. He is not to be allowed access to any sharp objects, heavy machinery or any equipment that could be damaging to his mouth. SCP-56 must be fed with a special diet of soft food and drinks due to his mouth spot.

Description: SCP-56 is a middle-aged human male, standing at 1.83 meters tall and weighing 87 kilograms. SCP-56 has an unusual feature on his mouth, which appears to be a spot. The mouth spot is red in color and seems to be bulging, causing his frightened mouth appearance. SCP-56 wears normal glasses and a blue bandana on his head. He also wears a silver chain around his neck and carries a candy stick with him. 

SCP-56 is a highly organized and efficient individual, which can sometimes make him seem a bit controlling to others. He tends to take charge in group projects and events and delegate tasks in a matter-of-fact way, even when not asked to do so. This trait has been known to create humorous situations in the workplace. SCP-56 works as a mechanic and has a vast knowledge of machinery and robotics, but due to his mouth spot, he cannot perform specific tasks. 

SCP-56 is cooperative with the Foundation and has been willing to participate in various tests and medical examinations to understand the nature of his mouth spot. However, he has been known to become agitated when discussing procedures that may require damage to his mouth. SCP-56's condition is currently being studied to determine if there are any anomalous properties associated with it.

Addendum: After observing SCP-56 for an extended period, it was discovered that the candy stick SCP-56 carries has a calming effect on him, which can be useful in keeping him cooperative during procedures that require him to be sedated or restrained.
