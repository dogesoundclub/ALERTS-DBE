Item #: SCP-5781

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5781 is to be monitored at all times, and any deviations from expected behavior are to be reported immediately. SCP-5781 is allowed access to standard amenities, but is not allowed to leave containment without proper clearance and supervision.

Description: SCP-5781 is a human male of average height and build, with distinctive spots on their face. They are often seen sporting a smile and wearing a police cap, as well as a bright red scarf and an LED gas mask. Their eyes are hidden behind normal glasses.

SCP-5781's main profession is that of a reporter, but they have been known to become easily sidetracked and forgetful. This scatterbrained behavior can lead to humorous situations, but can also cause complications in their work or personal life. SCP-5781 has been found wandering lost on several occasions, and it is believed that they may suffer from mild memory impairment.

While few anomalous properties have been observed, it is suspected that SCP-5781's odd attire may have been acquired from an encounter with an unidentified entity. Further investigation into the origin of SCP-5781's accessories is ongoing.

Addendum: Recent interviews with friends and colleagues of SCP-5781 suggest they are highly adaptable and resourceful, making them a valuable asset in certain situations. However, their tendency to forget important details could be a serious liability during high-stress scenarios. Further testing and observation is needed to determine the full extent of SCP-5781's capabilities.
