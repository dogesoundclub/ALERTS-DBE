Description: Item #7701 was a human male of average height and build, identified as a programmer. Item #7701's most distinctive features were the spots on its face, and the frequent smile that seemed to perpetually grace its features. Its eyes were obscured by the normal glasses it wore, but its head was adorned in a metallic purple hue, and a single gold earring was visible on one of its ears. Attached to its face was an LED gas mask, which was often in use.

Despite its eccentric appearance, Item #7701 was a highly goal-oriented individual with an intense work ethic. It possessed excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking, which often allowed it to take on more than it could handle and still come out on top. However, this drive also placed a great deal of stress on Item #7701, and it was known to isolate itself from others for extended periods.

It should be noted that while Item #7701 was adept at its work, it displayed no anomalous properties or abilities. Its neutralization occurred as a result of natural causes.
