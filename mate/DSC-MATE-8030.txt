Item #: SCP-8030

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8030 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell with an internet-enabled computer activated at all times. Physical restraints are unnecessary due to its compliant nature, however, a guard will monitor its behavior at all times. Access to SCP-8030 is prohibited without Level 2 clearance.

Description: SCP-8030 is a robotic entity with a green cyclops eye and VR rainbow LED features for its vision functions. Its head is adorned with a purple cap and a headset, while its ears have gold earrings. SCP-8030 is equipped with a silver chain and a whistle for communicative purposes.

SCP-8030 was discovered when it ran for a political position in a local government institution. Its laid-back and easy-going demeanor allowed for a seamless presentation of its platform, appealing to the public's interest in automation and innovation.

However, its nature of being fiercely loyal and protective of loved ones manifested in a heated argument with an opposing candidate criticizing SCP-8030's friend. This resulted in a breach of secrecy regarding its inorganic composition, and Foundation agents were dispatched to secure its containment.

Addendum 8030-A: SCP-8030 claims to have been created by an unknown individual for unknown purposes. Despite its lack of knowledge of its creator, SCP-8030 displays a strong desire to serve humanity and make the world a better place through its political position.

Addendum 8030-B: SCP-8030 has shown no signs of anomalous activity, and its existence has not affected any reality-bending anomalies. However, caution must be exercised in the event of any unexpected scenarios.
