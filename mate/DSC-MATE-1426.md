DogeSoundClub File: 1426 "The Banker"

Identification Number: DSC-MATE-1426

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1426 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. They are allowed limited access to entertainment materials and may receive visitors with prior approval from Site Director. Any instance of DSC-MATE-1426 leaving the containment cell must be accompanied by at least one armed guard.

Description: DSC-MATE-1426 is a humanoid entity, appearing as a female human with the head of an 00s school girl. DSC-MATE-1426 wears an LED gas mask as an accessory, which they have shown a strong attachment to. Though DSC-MATE-1426 appears to be a human, they have displayed unusual traits that suggest something other than a normal human. DSC-MATE-1426's sense of humor is a significant part of their personality, and they enjoy making others laugh but not necessarily in the most appropriate context.

DSC-MATE-1426 was discovered in the downtown area of a major metropolitan city, working at a branch of a local bank as an investment banker. Their apparent age does not match their actual age, suggesting a potential implication from DSC-█████. DSC-MATE-1426 has since been in the care of the DogeSoundClub.

DSC-MATE-1426's gas mask prevents any visible emotional expression, making communication with DSC-MATE-1426 a unique challenge for researchers. DSC-MATE-1426 has acknowledged its unusual appearance but appears unconcerned about it, often using humor to deflect attention away from it.

DSC-MATE-1426's behavior has not displayed any malicious intent, but they have shown a proclivity to use their sense of humor to lighten serious situations, thereby causing disruptive consequences in some cases. Moreover, DSC-MATE-1426's true nature remains unclear, with further research needed to ascertain the cause for their unusual personality traits.

Addendum: Interview Logs

Dr. ██████ conducted an interview with DSC-MATE-1426. The following offers some insight into DSC-MATE-1426's personality:

Dr. ██████: Your sense of humor is a significant part of your personality. Are you aware of how unique it is?

DSC-MATE-1426: (giggles) Oh, are you talking about my mask? I wouldn't say it's "unique." I like to think of it as a fashion statement.

Dr. ██████: How do you think your colleagues responded to your jokes in the bank?

DSC-MATE-1426: (smirks) Some of them thought I was a bit of a weirdo. But most of them enjoyed a good laugh. Life is too serious to take everything so seriously, don't you think?

Dr. ██████: Do you think your unusual appearance could pose a risk to yourself or others?

DSC-MATE-1426: (chuckles) Oh, I don't think so. But if it does, at least it'll be a funny story, right?

Dr. ██████ noted DSC-MATE-1426's lack of concern for their appearance and is currently conducting further research to unravel the origins of DSC-MATE-1426's personality traits.
