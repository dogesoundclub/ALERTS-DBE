Item #: DSC-MATE-561

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-561 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with reinforced steel walls and equipped with a VR system to accommodate the subject's eyes. A diet of raw meat is to be provided to the subject daily. Access to any electronic devices is strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-561 appears to be a male tiger, standing at approximately 1.8 m tall on his hind legs. The subject possesses a pair of jade LED ocular implants that enable him to view and interact with virtual reality environments. DSC-MATE-561 wears a blue bandana around his head and a silver chain around his neck.

Observation of DSC-MATE-561 has shown that he has an introverted and anxious personality, being frequently frightened and surprised by events he is unable to control or foresee. Nonetheless, he displays a strong sense of responsibility and dedication, often attempting to accomplish more than is reasonable or feasible.

DSC-MATE-561's primary occupation seems to be as a programmer or coder, though the specifics of his expertise are uncertain at present. It is believed that this occupation spells out the target demographic to which he is most likely to appeal, given his potential uses as a virtual reality platform.

It is worth noting that DSC-MATE-561 should be approached with caution, as his reactions to sudden stimuli or surprises may provoke a hostile response. Any unauthorized attempt to use electronic devices in DSC-MATE-561's presence may result in damage to the equipment and the subject itself.

Addendum: Dr. ██████ believes that further research could potentially yield insights into the nature and extent of DSC-MATE-561's virtual reality abilities, as well as his precise role in the process of creating and maintaining digital environments. This research could lead to the development of new technologies and systems that might revolutionize the field of virtual reality. However, given the inherent risks posed by DSC-MATE-561, any such research must be carried out with the utmost care and prudence. Further research is pending approval from Site Command.
