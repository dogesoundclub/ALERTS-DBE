Item #: SCP-2635

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2635 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any requests for assistance should be dealt with swiftly to minimize any potentially hazardous consequences. Any efforts to remove SCP-2635 from their current position as a Real Estate Agent must be carefully coordinated to avoid alerting the general public to any anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-2635 appears as a Caucasian female with distinctive spotted facial features. She has blonde hair and wears a gold chain as an accessory. Notably, she also has a single wing protruding from her head, although its functionality has yet to be determined. Her eyes appear to be normal, although she often wears glasses in a professional context.

SCP-2635 has exhibited a strong sense of independence, often displaying reluctance to ask for help even when it is direly needed. This has led to some humorous incidents, such as stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost or attempting to move heavy furniture unassisted.

SCP-2635 maintains the position of a Real Estate Agent as a cover, and has demonstrated significant talent in salesmanship. It is believed that this may be the result of her anomalous properties, although further research is required to confirm this hypothesis.

Despite her independent nature, SCP-2635 appears to be cooperative with Foundation personnel, and has complied with containment procedures without incident thus far. However, her anomalous properties make her a potential risk to any mission involving secrecy or discretion. As such, all efforts to monitor and contain SCP-2635 must be carried out with the utmost care and attention.
