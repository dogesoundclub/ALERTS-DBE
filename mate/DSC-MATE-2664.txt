Description: SCP-2664 is a human female appearing to be in her mid-20s. SCP-2664 stands at 5'9" (175.26 cm) and weighs 145 lbs (65.77 kg). SCP-2664's most notable physical features are the spots on their face and their constant smile. SCP-2664's eyes are a bright orange with a distinct eyebrow pattern, which is as yet unexplained.

SCP-2664 typically sports a green hairdo that is not styled or arranged in any particular manner. SCP-2664's ears are pierced, and they wear a red cross earring on the left side. They also wear a silver chain around their neck and a gas mask to protect against possible hazardous substances.

SCP-2664 is generally good-natured, but they can be impulsive and reckless, often jumping into situations without considering the consequences beforehand. Despite their job as a transportation operator, SCP-2664 has a tendency to show off and impress others, often leading to minor accidents or mishaps.

It is currently unknown if SCP-2664's anomalous properties have any connection to their recklessness, but further observation and experimentation may be warranted.
