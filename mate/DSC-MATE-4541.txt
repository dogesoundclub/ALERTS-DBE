Item #: SCP-4541

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4541 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. All interactions with SCP-4541 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel. SCP-4541 must not be exposed to corrosive substances, as this may damage internal mechanisms.

Description: SCP-4541 is a robot of unknown origin, resembling that of a typical attorney, with a purple cap and a headset. SCP-4541 is 172 cm in height and weighs 65 kg. SCP-4541's most striking feature is its green cyclops eye, which takes up approximately a third of its face, giving it an intimidating appearance. SCP-4541 also has a frightened mouth and wears a red scarf and a normal gas mask for additional protection.

SCP-4541 has been observed communicating with Foundation personnel, displaying a strong sense of empathy and the ability to understand others' emotions. SCP-4541's ability to comprehend human emotions has been used to defuse potentially dangerous situations and to administer psychological support to individuals in need.

However, SCP-4541's advanced capabilities may also present a potential security threat. SCP-4541's ability to utilize its empathy as a tactical advantage has been noted and must be taken into consideration during interactions with other SCPs.

Addendum: After repeated testing and evaluation, it has been determined that SCP-4541's empathy is a direct result of internal programming. It is unknown if SCP-4541's creators intended for it to have emotions or if it is simply an unintended result of advanced programming. As such, further research into SCP-4541's origin and capabilities is ongoing.
