Description: 

DSC-MATE-7286 is a male Tiger of unknown origin, standing at 2.2 meters in height and weighing 210 kg. Its distinguishing feature is its blue clown eyes, which emit a strange energy that affects those who gaze into them for too long. DSC-MATE-7286 has a doge hat on top of its head, with an accompanying red cross earring in its ears. It also wears a gold chain around its neck, with a small silver pocket watch attached to it.

DSC-MATE-7286's anomalous ability manifests in the form of an intense focus on details, to the point of obsession. This trait can manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet. However, the most notable expression of DSC-MATE-7286's personality is its dedication to its job as a train driver.

DSC-MATE-7286 demonstrates an almost supernatural understanding of mechanics and engineering, allowing it to pilot any train with precise accuracy. Its obsession with details makes it a model employee, completing every task given to it with efficiency and precision. However, this has also led to DSC-MATE-7286's unusual fixation on trains, with a strong attachment forming to the vehicles under its control.

DSC-MATE-7286 has shown signs of depression and anxiety when separated from the locomotives it is familiar with for lengthy periods. It will often request to be reassigned to the same vehicle as soon as possible, demonstrating clear distress when separated from them for too long.

Despite its benign nature, DSC-MATE-7286's abilities still pose a potential threat to Foundation personnel. Their focus and dedication have led to numerous close calls on the tracks. DSC-MATE-7286 must be kept under constant surveillance to avoid any accidental train derailments or collisions.

Addendum: Further testing has revealed that DSC-MATE-7286 also displays an unusual resistance to hypnosis and mental manipulation. Whether this resistance is related to its anomalous abilities is still under investigation.
