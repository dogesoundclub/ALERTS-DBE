Item #: SCP-8416

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8416 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at all times when not performing duties as a medical doctor. Access to SCP-8416 must be granted only to personnel with level 3 security clearance or higher. In case of any sudden outbursts or displays of risky behavior, the medical staff must be informed immediately.

Description: SCP-8416 is a male human with a distinctive feature on his face, a spot on the mouth that never fades away. SCP-8416's eyes are a bright, deep red, resembling those of a clown. SCP-8416 always wears a blue bandana over his head, concealing his hair entirely. The earring on his left ear is a green cross-shaped metal with a perceived power to heal. SCP-8416 carries an obsession with medical staff and never misses an opportunity to wear a medical mask over his mouth while working. Also, he adorns himself with a red scarf that he wraps around his neck.

Personality: SCP-8416 is spontaneous and often likes to take risks or decide things quickly. He is a lover of humor, and it isn't uncommon for him to jump off a cliff into a lake or river on a whim. He derives pleasure from his work as a physician and takes great pride in helping others. Despite being an anomaly, SCP-8416 never shies away from social situations, and often engages in jokes and lighthearted banter with his colleagues.

Addendum: SCP-8416 has raised notable concern from other doctors, who often question the safety of his medical procedures due to his outlandish behavior. SCP-8416 denies these allegations and requests that the Foundation investigate the claims to protect his reputation as a skilled doctor.
