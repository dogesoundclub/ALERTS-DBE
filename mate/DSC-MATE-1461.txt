Item #: SCP-1461

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1461 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to SCP-1461 is only permitted with the authorization of at least two Level 2 personnel. Any interaction with SCP-1461 outside of testing and research purposes is strictly prohibited.

SCP-1461's daily needs, such as food and water, should be provided as per standard site protocol. Additionally, due to SCP-1461's habit of smoking, an isolated smoking area has been designated within the containment cell.

Description: SCP-1461 is a male human with a distinctive appearance. He has multiple spots on his face, particularly around his cheeks and forehead. SCP-1461 can often be seen wearing a short peak cap and a gold chain around his neck. He also wears a jade earring on one of his ears.

Despite having a relaxed and laid-back personality, SCP-1461 can become fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about. This has been observed during social interactions with researchers and during testing exercises.

SCP-1461 has revealed that his occupation is that of a reporter, and he has shown knowledge of various urban legends and supernatural occurrences. However, SCP-1461 has not shown any active ability or knowledge of the anomalous nature of his surroundings and colleagues.

Addendum: SCP-1461's access to various news outlets has been restricted due to the risk of containment breaches. Reports of anomalous events appearing in news articles have led to increased public awareness of the paranormal. Therefore, monitoring of SCP-1461's reports is vital to ensure the continued safety and security of the Foundation.
