Item #: SCP-436

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-436 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber fitted with an air filtration system capable of accommodating SCP-436's size. Access to the containment chamber is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel and above. Any requests for interaction with SCP-436 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel. SCP-436 is to be provided with a standard diet of raw meat and water until further notice.

Description: SCP-436 is a male humanoid of the species Panthera tigris, commonly known as a tiger. SCP-436 stands at approximately 2.4 meters tall and has a weight of approximately 272 kilograms. SCP-436 is able to communicate verbally in English and demonstrates a high level of intelligence and problem-solving skills. SCP-436 has a frightened mouth and red clown eyes, making it difficult to determine its emotional state at times.

SCP-436 is often seen wearing a red beanie and a gold earring. SCP-436 also wears a normal gas mask at all times, citing the need for clean air. It is unknown if SCP-436 requires the gas mask for survival or if it is merely a preference. SCP-436 works as a programmer for the Foundation, often providing assistance with computer-based anomalies.

SCP-436 has a great sense of humor, often using it to alleviate tension or stress. SCP-436 will often tell amusing stories or do silly impersonations to lighten the mood. However, SCP-436 is aware of its own strength and can become agitated quickly, leading to potentially dangerous situations.

Addendum: SCP-436 has been placed on probation after an incident in which it accidentally injured two Foundation personnel during a fit of anger. SCP-436 has been advised to seek counseling and anger management classes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
