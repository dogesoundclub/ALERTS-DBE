Item #: DSC-MATE-3201

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3201 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3201 is to be granted to personnel with Level 2 clearance and above, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-3201 must be supervised by at least two armed guards.

Description: DSC-MATE-3201 is a humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, and appears to be a female in her mid-twenties. DSC-MATE-3201's most notable features are the spots on her face and the red clown eyes, which have been surgically implanted. DSC-MATE-3201 often wears a choker and a green cross earring in her left ear.

DSC-MATE-3201's personality has been observed to be somewhat reckless, with a tendency to act impulsively without fully considering the consequences of her actions. This behavior has resulted in several minor accidents and mishaps, which DSC-MATE-3201 seems to take in stride as humorous mishaps.

DSC-MATE-3201's job is that of a theater manager, a position which has not been affected by her anomalous properties. However, due to DSC-MATE-3201's unpredictable behavior, it is recommended that any interactions with her be approached with caution.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-3201 accidentally activated a previously undetected anomalous object, resulting in a containment breach. The object in question has since been neutralized, but DSC-MATE-3201's carelessness and impulsiveness have been noted as potential risks for future incidents.
