Item #: SCP-6369

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6369 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no less than ten security personnel present at all times. Any attempts by SCP-6369 to leave its chamber are to be prevented by any means necessary. All interactions with SCP-6369 are to be conducted by remote communication to avoid any physical contact.

Description: SCP-6369 appears to be a human male theater manager. However, it possesses several anomalous features, including VR Jade LED eyes and a frightened mouth. Its head is adorned with a Doge hat and a green cross earring. It is also frequently seen wearing a silver chain and carrying a candy stick.

SCP-6369's personality is described as being highly detail-oriented, with a tendency towards obsessive behavior. Its fixation on categorizing and organizing objects can manifest in unexpected ways, such as arranging books in size order or color-coding food in its refrigerator.

SCP-6369's behavior becomes increasingly erratic when confronted with disorder or chaos, often leading to violent outbursts and attempts to enforce its organization on others. Its precise capabilities are unknown, but it has demonstrated the ability to control certain objects and people in its vicinity through unknown means.

Addendum: Due to SCP-6369's unpredictable behavior and anomalous abilities, it is recommended that all researchers attempting to study it exercise extreme caution and approach it with utmost care. Any attempts to provoke or undermine its obsessive tendencies could result in disastrous consequences.
