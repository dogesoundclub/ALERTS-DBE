Description: SCP-5083 is a male tiger with a frightened mouth and glasses that exhibit a notable level of intelligence. It wears a police cap and a jade earring as well as holding a cigarette.

SCP-5083 exhibits a strong sense of independence, which can result in disobeying rules and regulations it considers unnecessary. SCP-5083's rebellious behavior includes leaving work early or taking time off without prior approval.

SCP-5083 functions as a veterinarian, providing medical care and treatment to socialized animals. It is capable of fluently communicating with domesticated animals, but communication with other species is under review. SCP-5083's medical skills are of a high level, and it has been reported to have saved the life of multiple animals in critical conditions.

SCP-5083's capabilities have prevented its discovery by the public. The tiger has executed the veterinarian role with apparent ease and naturalness, indicating that SCP-5083 could have integrated into society with significant ease.

Note: SCP-5083's presence is a significant deviation from expectations. Future research should focus on identifying anomalous characteristics related to its intelligence and communicative skills.
