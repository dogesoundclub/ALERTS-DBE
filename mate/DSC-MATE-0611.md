Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-611 is to be kept under surveillance at all times in his place of employment, and any interaction with civilians must be supervised by Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-611 may be allowed to continue his job as a car salesman on the condition that he does not reveal any anomalous abilities.

Description: DSC-MATE-611 is a human male with a distinctive appearance. His face is marked with spots and a constant smile, which may make him appear friendly and approachable. He has parted pink hair and a gold earring in each ear. His forehead is adorned with a goggle, which allows him to perceive things that are normally invisible.

DSC-MATE-611's mouth is always covered with a medical mask, and he sports a gold chain around his neck. He has demonstrated the ability to fix objects and devices in unconventional ways, using duct tape or paper clips to repair them. DSC-MATE-611 has a practical and hands-on personality, and he tends to be resourceful when dealing with difficult situations.

DSC-MATE-611's anomalous abilities are not fully understood, but they seem to be related to his practical skills. He has been observed rigging up makeshift solutions to problems that others would find impossible, and he has the ability to perceive and manipulate mechanical and electronic devices that are normally invisible. DSC-MATE-611's abilities do not seem to have any adverse effects on his health or well-being.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-611 has shown compliance with Foundation personnel and has not exhibited any dangerous behavior. However, given the potential risks associated with anomalous abilities, DSC-MATE-611's containment must be maintained at all times. DSC-MATE-611's abilities have the potential to be very useful to Foundation researchers, and further study is recommended.
