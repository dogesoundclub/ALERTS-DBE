Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7608 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to its nature as a fast food worker, DSC-MATE-7608 is allowed supervised access to the Site-██ cafeteria during designated meal times. All personnel are to avoid direct eye contact and refrain from any sudden movements that may cause distress to DSC-MATE-7608.

Description: DSC-MATE-7608 appears to be a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and neon VR LED eyes. The subject wears a hoodie and a silver chain around its neck, and is often seen smoking a cigarette. Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, DSC-MATE-7608 possesses a natural talent for leadership and a commanding presence that often draws others to follow its lead.

DSC-MATE-7608's abilities manifest primarily in social situations, where it has a tendency to take charge and direct those around it. This effect is heightened in the subject's place of employment, where it has been observed to directly influence the actions and decisions of its co-workers. DSC-MATE-7608 is also capable of using its natural charisma to manipulate individuals, as well as to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations.

In addition to its leadership skills, DSC-MATE-7608 displays an aversion to physical contact and a tendency to become anxious and distressed in unfamiliar or uncomfortable situations. It is recommended that all personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-7608 remain calm, non-aggressive, and avoid any sudden movements that may trigger a reaction.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7608 was recovered from a fast food restaurant in [REDACTED], where it was discovered to be the unofficial leader of the restaurant's staff. Reports of DSC-MATE-7608's influence over both customers and co-workers led to Foundation intervention and subsequent containment. Further study of DSC-MATE-7608's abilities is ongoing.
