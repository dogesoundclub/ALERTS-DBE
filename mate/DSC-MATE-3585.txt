Item #: 3585

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3585 is to be monitored by Foundation agents and kept under close observation at all times. Subject is currently employed as a news anchor and may continue to hold this position, but must be restricted from reporting on any anomalies or supernatural events. 

In the event that Subject 3585 shows signs of an SCP-related mental or physical aberration, they are to be immediately removed from their position and detained for further testing and observation. 

Description: Subject 3585 appears to be a human female with unusual physical features. She has orange stripes on her face and a metal blue head, with a two-color band across her forehead. Her eyes are hidden behind normal glasses and she wears a medical mask over her mouth at all times. 

Subject 3585's personality is characterized by impulsiveness and risk-taking behavior. Despite her seemingly mundane job as a news anchor, she has been observed engaging in dangerous activities on a whim, such as base jumping and bungee jumping from high structures. 

The origin of Subject 3585's anomalous traits is currently unknown. It is possible that she was born with these features, or that they were the result of exposure to an SCP-related phenomenon. 

Addendum: It is worth noting that Subject 3585 has not yet displayed any inclination towards using her anomalous abilities for malevolent purposes. However, her unpredictable nature and impulsiveness make her a potential threat to both herself and others. Further observation and testing is necessary to assess the full extent of her abilities and potential risks.
