Item #: SCP-7431

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7431 is currently held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The containment cell is to be kept clean and equipped with basic furniture and amenities, such as a bed, toilet, and reading materials. SCP-7431 is allowed access to a sewing machine and basic sewing supplies under supervision for the purposes of maintaining its mental and emotional well-being.

SCP-7431 is to be provided with a steady stream of work in the form of fashion design commissions, with specific items requested by Foundation staff or for public events. Any designs or products created by SCP-7431 are to be closely monitored, tested, and approved by Foundation staff before being released to the public.

SCP-7431's Jade Earring has been determined to possess anomalous properties, and is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██.

Any requests or communication made by SCP-7431 to non-Foundation personnel are to be redirected and managed by Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-7431 is a human male of average height and build, appearing to be in his mid-30s. The most noticeable feature of SCP-7431 is its permanent smile, which it appears to maintain regardless of its emotional state. SCP-7431's face is further defined by a pair of normal glasses and a retro cap, with a two-color band on its forehead.

SCP-7431 often accessorizes its outfits with a gold chain, which appears to be purely for aesthetic purposes.

SCP-7431 is a fashion designer by occupation, possessing a practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving. SCP-7431 has demonstrated an ability to fix damaged or broken items in unconventional ways, using items such as duct tape or paper clips to create makeshift solutions.

SCP-7431's Jade Earring has been observed to emit a low-level frequency which subtly influences the emotions and decision-making of those in close proximity to it. The exact extent and limitations of this effect are currently under investigation.

SCP-7431 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, agreeing to containment and providing its services as a fashion designer. However, due to its anomalous properties and potential risk to public safety, SCP-7431 is to be contained and monitored by the Foundation indefinitely.
