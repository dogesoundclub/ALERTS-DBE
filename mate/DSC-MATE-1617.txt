Item #: SCP-1617

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1617 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-1617’s cell is restricted to Level-3 personnel or higher. SCP-1617’s daily routine is to be strictly monitored to ensure that it adheres to its expected behaviour.

Description: SCP-1617 appears to be a human male, aged ██, with a distinctive mohawk hairstyle and gold earring on the left ear. SCP-1617 wears normal glasses and a red scarf around its neck. SCP-1617 is a mechanic by trade and has a strong knowledge of various mechanical systems.

SCP-1617 can be described as reliable and organized, but at the same time stubborn in nature. It has a hard time letting go of its routines or accepting new ideas, which can lead to some humorous situations when it encounters unexpected changes or challenges. SCP-1617 has been observed to wear a medical mask whenever it performs maintenance work on any machines, which could be attributed to its fear of getting sick or possibly an obsession with cleanliness.

When questioned about its past, SCP-1617 claims to have nothing significant to disclose. However, it shows an affinity towards fixing complex machinery, which has led researchers to speculate that SCP-1617 may have had a background in mechanical engineering. SCP-1617 also suffers from occasional bouts of claustrophobia, which may have been caused by a traumatic experience in the past.

Addendum 1617-A: During routine maintenance of SCP-████’s containment chamber, SCP-1617 spontaneously offered to fix a malfunctioning mechanical component and succeeded in doing so. Following this, SCP-1617’s exemplary work has been rewarded with the privilege of working on all mechanical systems within Site-██. Due to its considerable expertise, it is invaluable to the Foundation for maintaining machinery throughout the site.
