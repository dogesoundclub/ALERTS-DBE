Item #: 5587

Object Class: Monkey

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5587 poses no immediate threat, and as such, only requires minimal containment efforts. Item 5587 is to be tasked with assisting firefighting units and must be monitored during all fire-fighting procedures. Any unusual behavior or powers must be reported immediately to the Foundation.

Description: Item 5587 is a male monkey with normal black hair, blue clown eyes, and a frightened mouth. Item 5587 wears a gold chain and a candy stick and has a goggle on its forehead. Aside from the physical aspect of Item 5587 is the slight scare it exudes. It is capable of doing considerable harm to itself and its surroundings due to its inexperience and incompetence when it comes to fire-fighting procedures. Nevertheless, Item 5587 exhibits a strong sense of independence and stubbornness.

Personality: The item's personality is somewhat comical, with it showcasing stubbornness and independence to the point of hilarity. It always insists on doing things by itself, even when it clearly needs help. This trait has led to several funny and absurd situations, including attempting to move large pieces of furniture or refusing to use a map when lost. Despite the humor, the Foundation must be wary of the item's independent streak, as it can be potentially dangerous if left to its own devices.

Addendum 5587-1: Item 5587 has shown minor signs of anomalous behavior when near fires. It displays a stronger sense of smell, and its physical capabilities seem to increase. This incident has led to a re-evaluation of security protocols regarding Item 5587's containment. Monitoring its abilities and general behavior during fire-fighting assignments is now a priority for the Foundation.
