Item #: SCP-6174

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6174 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. All attempts at communication with SCP-6174 should be done through written means, as the subject has been known to become aggressive when spoken to. 

Description: SCP-6174 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, measuring approximately 60 cm in height and 12 kg in weight. The subject displays physical features such as a frightened mouth, normal glasses, a red beanie, a two-color band on its forehead, and a gold earring on its right ear. SCP-6174 is frequently seen holding a candy stick, which has been shown to calm the subject when given as a form of positive reinforcement. 

SCP-6174 is characterized as being absent-minded and forgetful, often losing track of time and appointments. The subject has not demonstrated any anomalous abilities or traits beyond its forgetfulness, but researchers are urged to exercise caution when working with SCP-6174 as it has been known to become defensive when provoked or startled. 

SCP-6174 was discovered by MTF Gamma-6 agents in rural southeast Asia, where it was being used as labor on a small farm. Foundation personnel were alerted to SCP-6174's anomalous nature after locals reported odd behavior and strange sightings of a "red-hatted monkey". After a successful retrieval, SCP-6174 was transported to Site-██ for further study. 

Addendum: During routine behavioral testing, SCP-6174 was witnessed engaging in a form of self-hypnosis when given a set of instructions and a task to complete. The subject would repeat the instructions to itself and become noticeably more focused until the task was completed. Further investigation is needed to determine if this behavior is anomalous in nature.
