Special Containment Procedures: Subject 237 is to be observed at all times by a minimum of two trained staff members.

Description: Subject 237 is a male monkey commonly referred to as "Sparky" by those who work with him. His most notable feature is his red clown eyes, which are a genetic abnormality unique to his species. He is often seen wearing a doge hat and a jade earring, as well as a silver chain around his neck. As an electrician, he is adept at handling high voltage equipment and can perform basic repairs without any difficulty.

Personality: Despite his proficiency in his work, subject 237 has a tendency to be stubborn and set in his ways. He is slow to adapt to change, which can result in humorous situations when he encounters unexpected obstacles. However, his reliability and attention to detail make him an invaluable asset to the team, and he is trusted to complete his duties without incident.

Additional Notes: Subject 237 has shown above average intelligence for his species and is capable of basic problem-solving. He has also displayed a fondness for bananas and has been observed using tools to access them. Any attempts at fostering communication with subject beyond basic commands have been unsuccessful, as his vocalizations are limited to basic screeches and grunts. It is unknown if the red clown eyes serve any purpose beyond a visual anomaly.
