Item #: 2523

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 2523 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. While containment of 2523 is not considered difficult, it has been observed that 2523 prefers to socialize excessively with personnel, often distracting them from their duties.

Description: 2523 is a human male of average height and build, with bright orange stripes covering his face and a head adorned with green layers. 2523 also sports a goggle on his forehead, and a silver chain necklace that hangs loosely around his neck. Additionally, a green cross earring adorns each of 2523's ears, and they are often seen with a candy stick in their mouth.

2523 tends to be outgoing and social, often drawing attention to themselves and telling jokes to those around them. This behavior has been known to distract personnel from their duties, causing 2523 to be monitored closely during interactions with others.

Despite its playful demeanor, 2523 has shown moments of exceptional mechanical skill and ingenuity, leading them to be employed as a mechanic. However, swayed by the stability of routine employment, they have been compliant in their containment thus far.

Addendum: During a routine physical exam, it was found that 2523's skin contains traces of an unknown compound that has yet to be identified or researched. Further testing is necessary to determine the nature and function of this compound.
