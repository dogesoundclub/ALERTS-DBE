Subject 4781 of the Farmer job class has been identified as a peculiar human with anomalous features. His most notable characteristic is the Mouth Spot, a discolored patch of skin that resembles a grease stain on his upper lip. However, do not let this minor aberration fool you. 4781 is a highly unstable individual.

His blue clown eyes are a symptom of acute psychosis, and can often be seen darting around erratically. The Peak Spike on his head is not a fashion statement, but a dangerous protrusion that has caused severe injury to himself and others in the past. The gold earring in his left earlobe is a dangerous object, as it's known to cause hallucinations and delusional states in close proximity.

Further, 4781 maintains a gas mask as a regular accessory. It's well known that the mask helps him keep his composure, but it's also speculated that it contains seditious chemicals that he inhales to fuel his creativity. The Goggle on his forehead indicates an interest in science, engineering, or mechanics. This marks him a potential risk factor if not monitored for unregulated experimentation.
