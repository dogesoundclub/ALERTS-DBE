DSC-MATE-6982, also known as "The Reporter," is a male monkey that possesses a rather peculiar set of features. His normal black hair contrasts with his blue clown eyes, which are capable of inducing terror and panic in any individual who meets them. The monkey's mouth, meanwhile, appears to be in a constant state of fright, as if he is perpetually on the verge of screaming in terror.

Despite these unsettling features, DSC-MATE-6982 is known for his impressive organizational skills and efficiency. Although he can come across as somewhat controlling, this tendency has proven beneficial in situations where it is necessary to delegate tasks or take charge of a group project.

DSC-MATE-6982's fondness for gold accessories is also notable, with a gold earring and gold chain being among his most prized possessions. However, it is recommended that personnel exercise caution in their interactions with this DSC, as his unpredictable behavior and the unsettling effect of his gaze can be somewhat disconcerting.
