Item #: DSC-MATE-3765

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3765 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Access to internet and computer equipment are authorized for testing purposes. Any electronic devices within DSC-MATE-3765's presence must be monitored and checked for anomalous coding.

Description: DSC-MATE-3765 is a humanoid female of average height and build, with blonde hair and an unexplainable pair of wings. The eyes of DSC-MATE-3765 are a normal blue colour, however, she has distinctive orange stripes on her face and a red cross earring on her left ear. Her lips are always red, regardless of whether she is wearing lipstick or not. The entity is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-3765 is a skilled programmer and possesses an extraordinary ability to manipulate code. She is capable of creating self-aware programs that exhibit emotions, self-preservation instincts, and extremely complex coding. However, the entity's absent-minded nature often leads to coding errors or lapses in focus, which can have disastrous consequences.

Personality: DSC-MATE-3765 is a relaxed individual, often seen deep in thought or engrossed in her projects. She is easily distracted and forgetful and sometimes loses track of time. DSC-MATE-3765 is generally a friendly individual who is easy to communicate with but has a dry sense of humour. However, DSC-MATE-3765 can become agitated if her projects are interrupted or if she feels that her workspace has been disturbed. 

Addendum: Further testing of DSC-MATE-3765's abilities is authorized, but any resulting program must be subjected to thorough testing before release, as unpredictability cannot be ruled out. In the event of a containment breach, all electronic devices within the vicinity must be isolated, and staff are advised to keep a close eye on DSC-MATE-3765's movements.
