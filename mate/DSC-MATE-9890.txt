Item #: SCP-9890

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9890 is to be contained in a 5x5x5m reinforced steel chamber with ceiling-mounted security cameras monitoring its activities at all times. Any interaction with SCP-9890 must only occur under the supervision of at least two armed security personnel with prior clearance from a Level 4 researcher.

Description: SCP-9890 is a male Siberian tiger standing at 2.4 meters tall and weighing approximately 400 kilograms. It possesses jade LED eyes and wears a purple cap with a headset, as well as a red cross earring, a gold chain, and a normal gas mask.

SCP-9890 exhibits a unique personality trait in that it seems to have an emotional depth uncommon in most animals. It is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, and it has a fondness for music and art that evokes strong feelings. However, this emotional intelligence is combined with a sadistic inclination towards violence, earning it its classification as a villain.

With the help of its headset, SCP-9890 can manipulate the minds of those around it, hypnotizing them to do its bidding. It has been known to wreak havoc on unsuspecting urban areas, feasting on the fear and panic it causes.

SCP-9890 is exceptionally intelligent and adaptable, making it a formidable opponent in any situation. It has an uncanny ability to strategize and outmaneuver even the most seasoned foes, making it a constant threat to the Foundation and the general public.

Assessment: SCP-9890 is a highly dangerous and unpredictable entity that poses a significant threat to the Foundation's mission to secure, contain, and protect anomalous artifacts and entities. Its unique personality and powers make it a valuable target for future research, but extreme caution must be taken when interacting with it.
