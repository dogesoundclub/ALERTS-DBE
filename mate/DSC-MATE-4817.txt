Item #: SCP-4817

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4817 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Food and basic necessities are to be provided on a regular schedule. Any requests for additional amenities or comforts are to be evaluated by on-site personnel before approval. SCP-4817 is not to be allowed contact with any primates or primatologists. Any interaction with humans must be monitored closely.

Description: SCP-4817 is a male, monkey-like creature with a frightened mouth and eyes that are obscured by horn-rimmed glasses. It is approximately 45 cm in height and weighs 3.2 kg. SCP-4817 is capable of speaking and possesses remarkable wit, which it uses primarily for argumentative purposes. It has a gold earring in its left ear and a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-4817 currently works as a real estate agent, and has been known to use its quick wit and gift for debate in its profession. It has been observed engaging in playfully argumentative conversations with friends and family, though it has also been noted that these debates can sometimes become quite intense.

SCP-4817 appears to be largely self-sufficient, and has not displayed any noteworthy unusual abilities or behaviors. However, its unusual appearance and capabilities have made it of great interest to the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-4817 has requested that it be provided with a class of its own within the Foundation's containment procedures, citing its unique characteristics and abilities. However, due to its relative lack of danger or threat, this request has been denied at this time.
