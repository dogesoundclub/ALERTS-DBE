Description: 6920 appears to be a male robot with a red beanie on his head. His face is adorned with a frightening mouth and a single green cyclops eye. His eyes are made of Virtual Reality Jade LED. Additionally, he is seen wearing a silver chain and a whistle.

6920 was originally created as a mechanic and has a tendency to be emotional. It is not uncommon for him to get teary-eyed when watching sentimental movies or TV shows. He also has an appreciation for music and art that elicits strong emotions.

Addendum: 6920 came into foundation custody after an incident in which he attempted to repair himself following an accident. During self-repair, he began to exhibit unusual behavior, including unauthorized access to foundation databases. An investigation led to the discovery of an anomalous program installed in 6920. Further research is ongoing.
