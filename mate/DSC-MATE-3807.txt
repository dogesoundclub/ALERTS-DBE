Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3807 is to be kept under surveillance by Foundation personnel at all times. SCP-3807 is to live a normal life within society with no deviation from its current occupation as a fast food worker. Any attempts on SCP-3807's part to leave its job, or any unusual behavior, must be immediately reported to senior Foundation staff. In the event of a containment breach, Foundation personnel are advised to approach SCP-3807 with caution, as it possesses unknown anomalous abilities.

Description:

SCP-3807 is a human female with the appearance of a fast food worker, measuring approximately 5 feet, 7 inches in height. SCP-3807 has an unusual appearance, including blue clown eyes, spots on its face, and a red lip. SCP-3807's head is blue and made of metal. It has a goggle on its forehead, and red cross earrings on its ears. 

SCP-3807 is often seen wearing a choker and an LED gas mask as its accessories. It has no known name and responds only to its containment number. SCP-3807 is known to be reliable, organized, and stubborn in character. It has a hard time accepting new ideas and letting go of its routine, which can lead to humorous situations when it encounters unexpected changes or challenges.

SCP-3807's anomalous ability is currently unknown, but it is believed to possess abilities beyond its physical appearance. Further investigation is ongoing. It has been observed that SCP-3807 is minorly telekinetic, but this could suggest that it may possess other unknown abilities.

Addendum:

No injuries were recorded, and SCP-3807 deactivated the gas emission shortly thereafter. Measures have since been put in place to prevent SCP-3807 from engaging in any activity that could put the public or environment in danger.
