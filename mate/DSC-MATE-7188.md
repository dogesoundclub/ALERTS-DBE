Item #: 7188

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7188 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19, with standard amenities. Testing with Item 7188 is to be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel and must be conducted in a secure, controlled environment.

Description: Item 7188 is a human male, appearing to be in his late 20s to early 30s. He stands at an average height of 6 feet, with a lean build. Item 7188's most prominent facial feature is a series of pale, circular spots which border his cheeks, forehead and nose, giving him a distinctive and striking appearance.

Item 7188 is also known for his charming and highly charismatic personality, possessing a natural inclination towards making friends, being the center of attention, and making display of good social skills. His behavior can range from carefree and playful to overly sociable in certain situations, which has led to some amusing incidents within the research staff.

Item 7188's eyes are of a very unusual type, likely the result of an anomalous mutation. They resemble a pair of ski goggles, often confused with some form of protective equipment. They are composed of a clear polymer composite with irregular, isotropic properties which have yet to be fully analyzed.

Upon containment, Item 7188 presented numerous self-made upgrades, including a blue bandana worn around its head and a gold chain with a small medallion, both items potentially used for reinforcing personal branding.

The exact nature of these features (and by extension, Item 7188's abilities) remains a mystery requiring further testing.

Addendum: It is the unanimous agreement of all staff at Site-19 that interactions with Item 7188 be accompanied by a Level 3 or higher staff member, as it can cause unpredictable effects on the emotional states of those around it.
