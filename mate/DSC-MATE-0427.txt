SCP-427 has an exceptional ability to feel and understand the emotions of those around him. In addition, he can strengthen, weaken, and manipulate these emotions in others to some extent. This ability, along with his infectious humor and kindness, elevates his already charismatic personality. SCP-427 is capable of calming violent subjects or cheering up depressed subjects, regardless of the situation or his emotional state.

Despite his carefree, fun-loving personality, SCP-427 takes his job and safety very seriously. He completes his reporting duties with the utmost professionalism and looks out for the safety of his coworkers and associates. SCP-427 takes great pride in his appearance and takes care to maintain his physical appearance, as well as his emotional state.

Addendum: SCP-427's emotional capacity is overwhelmingly positive, but in instances where he experiences negative emotions, such as fear or anger, his abilities seem to intensify. Field agents are to take caution when around SCP-427 during these times.
