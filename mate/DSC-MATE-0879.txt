Special Containment Procedures: SCP-879 is to be monitored at all times through the security cameras installed throughout the facility. Access to SCP-879 is limited to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-879 is a human female designated as a Security Guard within Site-██. SCP-879 is 1.72 meters tall and has a slim build. The subject's head is styled with short, jet-black hair resembling that of a witch. SCP-879's eyes have been replaced with VR Rainbow LED, affording the subject the ability to see through various vision modes, such as night-vision and infrared. A pair of goggles are frequently worn on SCP-879's forehead.

SCP-879's most noticeable feature is a red cross earring that hangs from its left earlobe. It has been determined that this earring enhances SCP-879's already exceptional empathy, which can lead to the subject being able to sense and identify the emotional state of anyone within its range of perception. SCP-879's abilities can even have limited precognitive effects, and anyone under its influence may experience an altered sense of time.

SCP-879's mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and the subject is known to possess a keen interest in medicine and first aid. This has led to SCP-879 being viewed as somewhat of a source of aid and support for other personnel, able to calm frightened individuals or place a positive spin on negative situations.

Personality: SCP-879 is known for its intuitive and empathetic personality, always displaying a compassionate and caring demeanor towards others. SCP-879 has an innate ability to read the emotions of those around it, which the subject uses to provide comfort and support to anyone in need. SCP-879 frequently employs humor to diffuse tense situations, and is known to be able to diffuse conflicts before they escalate. SCP-879 cherishes its role as a security guard and is always willing to put aside personal comforts to ensure the safety of others. SCP-879's presence has been invaluable to maintaining the morale and wellbeing of everyone in Site-██. 

Note: SCP-879's abilities, while beneficial to Site-██, must be monitored closely. Any unusual changes in the behavior, mood, or outlook of SCP-879 should be immediately reported to the appropriate personnel. SCP-879's role can be both an asset and a liability, and so it is essential to maintain a careful balance when deploying the subject. End of Description.
