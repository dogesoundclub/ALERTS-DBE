Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1393 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with all furnishings made from durable materials. Access to any mirrors or reflective surfaces should be restricted. Under no circumstances must subject 1393 be allowed access to any kind of candy or confectionery.

Description: Subject 1393 is a male monkey with piercing red clown eyes. He wears a retro cap and a gold chain around his neck. He often carries a candy stick, which he uses as a tool or a weapon in certain situations. 1393 displays a natural talent for leadership, often taking the role of the alpha figure in any given situation. 

Subject 1393's abilities are still not fully understood, but it is known that he has the power to influence others around him. This can be seen in his work as a fashion designer, where he tends to dictate the aesthetic direction of a project, often to the surprise of his colleagues. 1393 is naturally charismatic and can be quite charming when he wants to be, but he can also be fiercely territorial and aggressive when he feels threatened.

To date, subject 1393 has not displayed any anomalous properties beyond his ability to lead others. However, researchers are beginning to suspect that the candy stick he carries may have some kind of significance, and further study is required to determine the extent of its power. 

As always, caution is advised when dealing with subject 1393. While he can be a valuable asset in certain situations, his unpredictable nature and influence over others make him a potential danger to those around him.
