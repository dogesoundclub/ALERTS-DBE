Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1951 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. Any attempts to remove the medical mask covering its mouth must be immediately reported to the Site Director. It is to be confined in a standard humanoid containment cell, with additional psychological monitoring equipment installed. Interaction with SCP-1951 is to be limited to authorized personnel only.

Description: SCP-1951 is a human male in his mid-30s, standing at 5'11". Its face is characterized by a spot on its mouth that resembles a black ink stain, and its mouth is perpetually in a frightened expression. Its eyes are covered by ski goggles, and it often wears a gold earring in its left ear.

SCP-1951's most notable feature is the medical mask that covers its mouth. Although it has not been established why SCP-1951 wears the mask, it is hypothesized that it may be willingly self-inflicted, as it has reportedly refused to remove it when requested to do so.

SCP-1951 possesses a jovial personality and is known to enjoy making others laugh. It has a great sense of humor, often telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to entertain those around it. However, it is prone to sudden mood swings, which can result in aggressive behavior.

It is important to note that SCP-1951's humor may be used as a tool to distract from any concerning behavior or actions, and as such, any sudden changes in its behavior must be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Discovery: SCP-1951 was discovered by Foundation agents when it applied for a job as a news reporter with a local broadcasting company. It was deemed a potential threat due to its anomalous nature and was promptly contained.

Addendum: A thorough examination of SCP-1951's medical mask revealed that it contains a substance that may be responsible for its unusual behavior. Further analysis is ongoing.
