SCP Foundation Containment Breach Report:

Identification number: 842

Job: Politician

Species: Rabbit

Sex: Male

Brief Description: SCP-842 appears to be a male rabbit wearing a Doge hat and a jade earring on each ear. The rabbit is often seen wearing a red scarf and carrying around a candy stick. SCP-842 has a charming personality and a likable presence; however, its true nature is something to be feared.

Containment Procedures: SCP-842 is to be contained within a standard Class-D containment chamber, requiring a 24/7 security surveillance system. All personnel are to wear Level 3 hazmat suits due to SCP-842's anomalous effects. Any personnel who have come into contact with SCP-842 must undergo immediate debriefing and psychological evaluation.

Description: SCP-842 has displayed the ability to manipulate the emotions of those around it through a form of unexplained telepathy. Those who come into contact with SCP-842 report feeling overwhelmingly happy and willing to do almost anything for the rabbit, leading to instances of staff attempting to release the SCP from containment.

SCP-842 also has a tendency to plan ahead and can exhibit sudden spurts of spontaneity, often resulting in comical outcomes. However, it's essential to note that the rabbit's actions can have serious consequences on the world, given its influence on those it encounters.

Conclusion: SCP-842 must remain contained, with its anomalous attributes creating too great a risk to the public. The rabbit's abilities to manipulate and control the emotions of those around it must be met with a rigorous and strict containment protocol. Any attempt to appeal to SCP-842's charm must be met with the ultimate caution.
