Item #: 5771

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5771 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██, and is to be monitored at all times by security personnel. Access to the chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, and only authorized personnel are allowed to interact with 5771. Any breach attempts by 5771 are to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-5771 is a male monkey of unknown origin, standing at 3 feet tall and weighing approximately 45 pounds. Its eyes are ski goggles, and its head is adorned with a retro cap, with a goggle on its forehead. It wears a gold chain around its neck and often is seen with a candy stick in its mouth.

SCP-5771 is a highly intelligent creature, with a notable talent for problem-solving. Its practical and hands-on approach often leads to unconventional but effective solutions to problems. Its behavior can be unpredictable at times, and it has been known to attempt escapes from its containment chamber. 5771 has a strong desire for freedom, making it essential to keep it under continuous surveillance.

Of particular note is SCP-5771's occupation as a news anchor for a local television station. The circumstances regarding its employment are unknown, but its high skill level suggests that it was placed in the position with some knowledge of its abilities.

Addendum: Following an incident in which SCP-5771 made an escape attempt from its containment chamber, it was discovered that it has the ability to communicate verbally with humans. Its voice is described as high-pitched and raspy, with a noticeable lisp. SCP-5771 has been offered the opportunity to participate in further study, but thus far has declined. Its desire for independence makes it a unique subject and a potential asset to the Foundation.
