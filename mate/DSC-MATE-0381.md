Item #: 381

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 381 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject is allowed to wear their firefighter uniform while in containment, but the gas mask and any other accessories must be removed for safety reasons. Daily check-ups are required to ensure the subject's well-being, as well as to monitor any potential psychological effects from their empathetic nature.

Description: Subject 381 appears to be a male rabbit, measured at a height of 5'7" when standing upright. The subject has a frightened expression on their face, with a mouth that appears to be in a permanent state of anxiety. Their eyes are normal, but they wear glasses with no apparent magnification. The subject's forehead has two bands of color, one silver and one red. They have long, pointed ears, and one of them has a jade earring attached to it.

Subject 381 tends to wear a gas mask as an accessory, which is a standard issue for their job as a firefighter. The mask is not anomalous and can be safely removed when necessary, but should not be worn for any extended periods while in containment.

Personality: Subject 381 is a very empathetic and compassionate entity, often feeling others' pain and struggles as if their own. They have a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to fix everything and everyone around them, which can sometimes be both admirable and exhausting. The subject tends to overthink things at times, leading to feelings of anxiety and stress.

Despite their anxious nature, Subject 381 has proven to be a valuable asset as a firefighter due to their quick thinking and bravery. They have saved many lives over their career and continue to do so.

Addendum: Subject 381 has expressed a desire to help anomalous entities in need, particularly those who are trapped or suffering. While this sentiment is appreciated, caution should be taken in granting these requests, as the subject's empathetic nature may put them at risk of harm. Any requests must be approved by level 4 or higher personnel.
