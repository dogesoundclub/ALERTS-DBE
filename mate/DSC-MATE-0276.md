Item #: DSC-MATE-276

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-276 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Daily check-ups and psychological evaluations are to be performed by trained personnel to ensure DSC-MATE-276's mental and emotional well-being.

Description: DSC-MATE-276 appears to be a human male in his mid-thirties. Despite his occupation as a beautician, DSC-MATE-276 displays a visibly disheveled appearance, with uncombed hair and a lack of personal hygiene. DSC-MATE-276's face is dotted with multiple spots, and his mouth appears to be in a perpetual state of fear or agitation.

DSC-MATE-276's most prominent anomalous feature is its eyes, which resemble ski goggles. Despite appearing to be a cosmetic accessory, these goggles are permanently affixed to DSC-MATE-276's face and cannot be removed. It is believed that these goggles have the ability to provide DSC-MATE-276 with enhanced visual acuity and electromagnetic spectrum detection.

DSC-MATE-276's head has been described as "not arranged green," although the significance of this statement is currently unknown. DSC-MATE-276 also wears a gold earring in its left ear and a medical mask over its mouth, which is believed to be a personal preference rather than an anomalous trait.

Finally, DSC-MATE-276 wears a silver chain around its neck, which is believed to have no significance to its anomalous abilities.

Personality: DSC-MATE-276 appears to be a highly responsible and duty-bound individual, often taking on more tasks than it can handle. This tendency occasionally leads to humorous situations such as forgetting appointments, attempting to carry too many items at once, or failing to fit all its responsibilities into a single day.

Despite the unusual appearance and anomalous traits, DSC-MATE-276 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel and has expressed a desire to assist in research and containment of anomalous entities. However, DSC-MATE-276 has also been observed to display signs of anxiety and distress, most likely due to its physical abnormalities and social isolation.

Overall, DSC-MATE-276 remains a relatively benign anomalous entity that requires careful monitoring and psychological support to ensure its continued stability.
