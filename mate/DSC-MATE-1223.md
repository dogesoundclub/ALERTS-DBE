Item #: 1223

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1223 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. In order to ensure the safety of all staff, no personnel are allowed to enter the containment chamber without proper authorization and protective gear. Subjects entering the chamber must wear a gas mask at all times, due to possible risk of airborne contaminants.

Description: Subject 1223 is a male monkey of an unknown species, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. The subject has a frightened mouth and wears horned rim glasses on his eyes. He has normal black hair on his head and a goggle on his forehead. One distinctive feature of the subject is a jade earring on his ears, along with a gold chain around his neck.

Subject 1223's personality exhibits a tendency to forget things easily, leading to scatterbrained behavior. He may frequently miss important appointments or become lost while trying to find a new location. Despite this, the subject is highly intelligent and can perform complicated tasks with ease, as evident from his job as a banker prior to his containment.

Attempts to communicate with Subject 1223 have been met with limited success. The subject typically exhibits a preference for non-verbal communication, such as gesturing, drawing or arranging objects. The subject is also known for his strange affinity towards gas masks, and has been observed adjusting his normal gas mask frequently during his free time.

Addendum: Subject 1223's origins remain unknown, and no exact explanation has been found for his strange attachments to the gas mask and other accessories. Further study into the subject's behavior and abilities is recommended to better understand this strange entity.
