Subject 7464, also known by the moniker "The Idealist," is a human female and a prominent figure in the real estate industry. Her distinctive features include a pair of striking purple lips and a fashionable bucket hat perched on top of her head.

Upon closer inspection, she can be seen sporting a red cross earring on both ears, a subtle yet curious choice of accessory. The idealist rounds off her aesthetic with a silver chain draped around her neck, no doubt a sentimental memento from the countless protest rallies and picket lines she has been to.

While strongly motivated by her desire to improve the state of the world, the idealist's idealism may sometimes put her at odds with the realities of the urban landscape she inhabits. This sometimes leads to comical situations where she may end up protesting a well-meaning business or taking up arms against imaginary wrongs. Nonetheless, her fervent energy proves invaluable in galvanizing the wider urban community towards meaningful change. 

Subject 7464 is currently being monitored by Foundation agents to ensure her well-being and to prevent her from causing any undue distress or harm to the general populace.
