Item #: 5539

Object Class: Human

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5539 is to be monitored closely for any signs of abnormal behavior or fluctuations in personality. She may be allowed to maintain her position as a mechanic, as long as it does not lead to any threat of exposure to the existence of the supernatural.

Description: Subject 5539 appears to be a human female, with normal glasses covering her eyes and a bucket hat on her head. A goggle on her forehead and jade earring on each ear are also present. She is known to wear a medical mask and a silver chain as an accessory. While her appearance is somewhat unremarkable, her scatterbrained nature makes her a unique asset to the foundation.

Personality: Subject 5539 can be an easily distractible individual, with a tendency to forget important details or appointments altogether. As a result, she frequently finds herself in humorous situations such as getting lost while trying to find a new location. Despite her lack of focus, she displays remarkable technical expertise and resourcefulness when called upon to provide mechanical assistance.

Addendum: Noteworthy incidents involving subject 5539 include her dismantling a surveillance camera while attempting to repair it and briefly becoming lost in the maintenance tunnels. Despite these incidents, her value to the foundation has not been compromised, and she remains an important asset.
