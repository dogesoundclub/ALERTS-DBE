Subject 1638, also known as "Sarge", is a police officer with a unique genetic makeup. As a primate-based species, Sarge has a distinctive frightened mouth expression, which can be interpreted as vulnerability or fear. However, don't let his appearance deceive you, as Sarge is a fierce protector of his loved ones and will stop at nothing to defend them.

As a nod to his primate roots, he has taken to wearing a goggle on his forehead, reminiscent of old-timey fighter pilot helmets. However, it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the power of Sarge, as he often wields an LED gas mask as his weapon of choice in urban combat situations.

Sarge can be quite the character, with his easy-going and laid-back demeanor. But, he is no pushover and can get into some heated arguments when someone insults a member of his family or circle of friends. It is often humorous to see his transformation from a chilled-out monkey to a fierce defender in a matter of seconds.

Despite his appearance, Sarge is a force to be reckoned with and an integral part of the urban fantasy community. His loyalty and protectiveness make him an invaluable asset to those who call him a friend or ally. However, be wary of crossing him, as he will not hesitate to utilize all of his unique abilities to defend those he cares for.
