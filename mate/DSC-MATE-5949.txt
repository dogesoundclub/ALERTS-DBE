Item #: 5949

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5949 is to be contained in a secure holding cell located in Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a Faraday cage to prevent any electronic interference. Item 5949 is to be powered down when not in use and is to remain under constant supervision while active.

Description: Item 5949 is a male robot resembling a humanoid figure. The robot is equipped with a green cyclops eye, and a frightened mouth. The head of the robot is adorned with green hair under a purple cap, and the ears boast of a jade earring. Wearing a red scarf and a standard gas mask as the accessories, the robot appears to be well suited for its job as a politician. However, its overall appearance is deemed alarming to anyone who has never encountered a robot before.

Personality: Item 5949 is endowed with an unusual personality, which tends to be overly caring and nurturing. It has a strong urge to protect those it cares about and show compassion towards them, even to the point where it treats its loved ones as its own children. This personality trait has led to quite a few uncomfortable and humorous situations—especially when it tries to use its political influence to help loved ones in need.

Addendum: Item 5949 was recovered from a private organization that developed it and used it for political gain. The exact details of the organization and its main objective remain unclear. Initial interviews with Item 5949 reveal that the robot has no memory of its creation or purpose. Further evaluation and testing are necessary to determine if there are any hidden agendas related to its capabilities or origin.
