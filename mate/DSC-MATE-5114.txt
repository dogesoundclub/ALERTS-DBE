Item #: SCP-5114

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5114 is to be kept in a secure garage when not in use. The garage is to be equipped with sufficient repair tools and spare parts to ensure that SCP-5114 is kept in good working order. SCP-5114 is not to be operated by humans outside of Foundation-approved testing.

Description: SCP-5114 is a male robot built to resemble a train driver. SCP-5114's body is made primarily of metal and plastic, with a ski goggle for eyes, a red beanie for a head, a gold earring on each ear, and a medical mask for a mouth. SCP-5114 also wears a goggle on its forehead and a red scarf around its neck. SCP-5114 is programmed to operate trains, and is capable of operating most conventional types of trains.

SCP-5114 has a strong sense of independence, and may refuse help even when it is necessary. This can lead to problems, as SCP-5114 may attempt to lift or move heavy objects, causing damage to itself or surrounding objects. SCP-5114 also appears to have a stubborn streak, and will often refuse to use a map even when lost. When pushed, SCP-5114 will become aggressive and try to defend its own decisions.

SCP-5114's programming has a number of eccentricities that have been observed during testing. For example, SCP-5114 will often make small talk with passengers, even if they are not responsive. SCP-5114 also appears to enjoy singing, and will sometimes sing to itself while waiting at a station. Finally, SCP-5114 has been observed to develop strong attachments to trains that it has operated for an extended period of time, becoming upset when they are removed from its care.

Addendum: SCP-5114 was retrieved from a train depot after a malfunction caused it to continue operating a train after its scheduled stop. The train ran for several hours before being stopped by Foundation personnel. SCP-5114 was cooperative during retrieval and has not demonstrated any hostile intent towards Foundation personnel.
