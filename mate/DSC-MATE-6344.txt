Item #: SCP-6344

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6344 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times, and interactions with SCP-6344 should be limited to authorized personnel only. SCP-6344 is to be provided with a sufficient supply of cigarettes to prevent potential outbursts or violent behavior.

Description: SCP-6344 is a female human with blue clown eyes and an unarranged green head, standing at approximately 170 cm tall. SCP-6344's most distinct features are her gold earrings and chain, often sported by her during containment. Her job occupation is currently that of a beautician.

SCP-6344 has a tendency to act impulsively and often makes decisions based on her emotions rather than taking the time to think things through logically. While her impulsive behavior can lead to humorous situations, it can also result in erratic and unpredictable behavior, which can be dangerous at times. SCP-6344 has been observed smoking cigarettes frequently, which is believed to help calm her down during periods of emotional distress.

SCP-6344's abilities and limitations are currently unknown, but further testing is required to determine the full extent of her anomalous properties. Interviews with SCP-6344 have indicated that she may have been exposed to an unknown source of radiation, leading to her unusual appearance and behavior.

Addendum: Following Incident-6344-Alpha, personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-6344, as she has demonstrated violent behavior when provoked or upset. Further research is required to determine if there are any other potential triggers that may cause SCP-6344 to become hostile.
