Item #: 5854

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject #5854, also known as "The Reporter," is to be kept in a standard containment chamber designed for primate species. The chamber must be equipped with a computer terminal and internet access to allow subject #5854 to fulfill its job as a reporter for a local newspaper. The chamber must have a bed, a television, and a feeding station, as well as a designated smoking area. Guards must be stationed around the chamber to prevent any unauthorized communication between subject #5854 and outside parties. 

Description: The Reporter, designated as Subject #5854, is a male monkey with horned rim glasses, a purple cap with a headset, a gold chain accessory, and a cigarette. Standing at approximately three feet tall and weighing approximately 20 pounds, the Reporter is known for its forgetfulness and absent-mindedness. When engaged in deep thought or focused on a project, the Reporter may lose track of time, appointments, or important events. This can lead to humorous situations, as well as potential security breaches if not closely monitored. 

Personality: The Reporter is a highly intelligent and skilled primate, able to read, write, and communicate with humans effectively. However, due to its forgetfulness and absent-mindedness, the Reporter can be unpredictable, unreliable, and potentially dangerous if left unattended. Authority personnel must be cautious when interacting with the Reporter, as it has been known to manipulate situations to its own advantage. However, when not focused on a project, the Reporter can be highly sociable and entertaining, often making jokes and telling stories to amuse its handlers. 

Additional Notes: The Reporter is a valuable asset to local news outlets, as its ability to gather information and write articles is highly respected. However, its unique personality quirks and potential for security breaches must be closely monitored to prevent any harm to society. Any attempts by the Reporter to communicate with outside parties must be immediately reported to authority personnel.
