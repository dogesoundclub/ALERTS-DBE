Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7677 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a standard-issue bed, desk and wardrobe. Any requests for additional items that do not pose a security threat may be approved by the project lead. SCP-7677 is to be fed a regular diet of fresh fruits, vegetables and grains.

Description: SCP-7677 is a humanoid entity with the physical appearance of a middle-aged female human. SCP-7677 has spots on their face and purple lips. SCP-7677 wears normal glasses and on top of their head, a pink rabbit is seen. They have a goggle on their forehead and Jade earrings in their ears. They normally wear a gas mask for protection against airborne hazards.

SCP-7677 is a farmer by occupation and has demonstrated no anomalous abilities beyond their unusual physical appearance. While they have a great sense of humor and may enjoy making others laugh, this behavior is not indicative of any anomalous activity.

Addendum: SCP-7677 has demonstrated a deep concern for environmental conservation, with a particular interest in sustainable agriculture. SCP-7677 has requested access to books and films on the topic and has begun a small garden in their containment chamber. Approval for this request was granted by project lead Dr. ██████. SCP-7677's interest in agriculture may prove to be useful for Foundation research into alternative food production methods.
