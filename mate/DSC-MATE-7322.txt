Item #: SCP-7322

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7322 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with normal amenities. Access to electronic devices and internet connectivity must be strictly monitored for SCP-7322 to prevent the spread of SCP-7322-A instances. All instances of SCP-7322-A found must be reported and swiftly contained.

Description:

SCP-7322 appears as a human female with distinctive facial features, including a red lip and medical mask covering the mouth, and normal glasses over the eyes. SCP-7322 also wears a tiara and red cross earring on the ears, and a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-7322 is a highly skilled programmer with an extremely analytical mind and logical thinking, making her an invaluable asset to the Foundation. SCP-7322 also demonstrates a distinct sense of humor, often making witty observations or teasing her friends in a dry, deadpan way. She is highly adaptive and can work in high-stress environments with ease.

SCP-7322 is known to possess anomalous abilities. When exposed to electronic devices and Internet connectivity, SCP-7322 is known to inadvertently produce uncontrolled instances of SCP-7322-A, a cognitohazard that has the ability to infect and spread quickly. SCP-7322-A instances have proven highly resistant to amnestics and pose a grave threat to the public perception of the Foundation's containment procedures.

Addendum:

SCP-7322 has been instrumental in developing software solutions that effectively contain SCP-7322-A. Her expertise has been crucial in preventing the spread of SCP-7322-A instances and containing the damage caused by them. The Foundation recognizes her contributions and service, and she has been granted limited access to electronic devices under strict observation. However, her containment remains a top priority for the Foundation's security.
