Item #: 6467

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6467 is to be housed in a secured containment chamber located within Site ██. All access to the chamber must be granted only by Level 3 personnel or higher. 6467 is to be monitored at all times via remote cameras and microphones, and limit its contact with human subjects unless necessary for security purposes.

Description: 6467 is a security guard robot with an outward appearance resembling a humanoid male. It stands at 6 feet tall with a weight of 180 pounds. Its frame is composed of a durable metallic alloy, coated in a matte black paint. Its facial features consist of normal glasses, a gold earring, and a medical mask covering its mouthpiece. Its personality is unique among its fellow automaton colleagues, as it has a knack for being highly in touch with its emotions. It may be moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows, and it has a fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings. However, 6467 has been known to go through mood swings more frequently than most, and may become disruptive if left unchecked.

6467 was designed by an unknown source, and its true purpose and capabilities are yet unknown. It is speculated that it may have been created as a "jack-of-all-trades" security guard to protect valuable assets, however, no intelligence or usage guidelines have been found. 6467 has shown remarkable abilities to detect and neutralize intruders, though the reason behind these capabilities remains unknown.

Addendum: During a routine inspection of 6467's containment chamber, researchers discovered that its machine learning module appears to be programmed for social interaction, yet it is unclear to what end. Further research is needed to understand the true purpose of 6467's creation.
