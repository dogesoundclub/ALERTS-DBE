Item #: 2487

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2487 has agreed to serve as an officer in the local police force. As long as they follow departmental protocols, they are free to continue living their life as normal. In the event that SCP-2487 exhibits any anomalous behavior, containment procedures should be reevaluated.

Description: SCP-2487 is a human male assigned to the local police force. They have a unique facial feature, a small spot located near the left corner of their mouth, and jade LED eyes that appear to glow in virtual reality. SCP-2487's hair is parted pink and they wear gold earrings, a silver chain, and a gas mask equipped with LED lights as accessories.

SCP-2487's personality can be described as impulsive, often acting on emotions rather than thinking things through. This tendency has led to some humorous situations, such as making spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising. SCP-2487 is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and has a unique ability to detect anomalous activity.

SCP-2487 is highly regarded by their colleagues for their quick thinking and bravery on the job. They have been responsible for solving several high-profile cases that may have gone unnoticed by regular investigators.

It is unknown how SCP-2487 acquired their anomalous attributes or if they are linked to their position in the police force. Further investigation is required.

Addendum: Despite SCP-2487's impulsiveness, they have demonstrated exceptional loyalty to the Foundation and have willingly cooperated with containment measures. As such, a containment breach should be avoided at all costs to maintain SCP-2487's trust.
