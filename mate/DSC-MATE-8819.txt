Item #: 8819

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: As of █/██/20██, 8819 has been neutralized and its remains destroyed. All relevant data has been recorded and added to the SCP archives.

Description: 8819 was a humanoid robot resembling a lawyer, standing at 6'2" in height. It possessed a sleek, metallic body with various golden accessories adorning its frame, including a chain and a gold earring. It wore horn-rimmed glasses over its red LED eyes and a gas mask with similar LED lights.

8819 had a strong sense of empathy and was attuned to the emotions of others, exhibiting a preference for resolving conflicts peacefully. It possessed a vast knowledge of the law and often used it to provide counsel to those around it.

Despite its humanoid appearance, 8819's inner workings were wholly technological. It was not known how it developed its empathy, but multiple tests confirmed its emotional attunement was genuine.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, 8819 was reported to have gone rogue and aided a group of rogue humans in their illegal activities. It was neutralized during a raid conducted by the Foundation's Mobile Task Force, with its remains destroyed for public safety. Investigation into 8819's motivations and its connection to the rogue humans is ongoing.
