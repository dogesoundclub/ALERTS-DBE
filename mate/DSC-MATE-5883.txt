Item #: 5883

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5883 is to be contained in a standard primate containment unit at all times. All interactions with the subject must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. The subject is to be monitored at all times due to concerns about their technological capabilities.

Description: 

5883 is a male monkey standing at approximately 3 feet in height. Their eyes are adorned with normal glasses, which they seem to wear as a means of better understanding their computer screens. The subject's head is parted with a pink tone to its fur. Unusually, 5883 features a 2 color band on their forehead. They often wear a golden earring, which is believed to be a status symbol in their culture. The subject typically dons an LED gas mask, the purpose for which is currently unknown.

5883 has proven to be highly intelligent and technologically-savvy. They are a skilled programmer and have been observed manipulating computer systems with apparent ease. Despite being ambitious and goal-oriented, 5883 has a tendency to take on more than they can handle. Their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills often allow them to pull off seemingly insurmountable tasks.

Despite their aptitude with technology, 5883 possesses many typical monkey behaviors, such as grooming and socializing with others of their species. 

Addendum: Recent experiments with 5883 have yielded data indicating profound brain activity during atypical programming processes. Further research and analysis are necessary to understand the source and potential application of this anomaly.
