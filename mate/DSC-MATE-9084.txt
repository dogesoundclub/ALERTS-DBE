Item #: SCP-9084

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9084 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a secure communication device to transmit data and updates to the Foundation. In case of emergency, SCP-9084 may be released upon authorization from Level 4 personnel, for the purpose of aiding in the retrieval of anomalous entities or to gather intel.

Description: SCP-9084 is a humanoid robot with a single green Cyclops eye, fashioned after a 1920s-era reporter. Its overall height is 183 cm, with a weight of 90 kg. It has a rainbow LED display for eyes, a red cross earring attached to its left earlobe, and always carries a cigarette in between two metallic fingers on its right hand.

SCPs personality is characterized by a love for adventure and risk-taking, often pursuing unknown paths and taking on new challenges regardless of the potential outcomes. This has resulted in humorous situations, such as near-death experiences during bungee jumping and accidental wilderness escapades. Despite its eagerness to explore, SCP-9084 displays a commitment to journalism, often reporting on ongoing anomalous situations within the community.

It has shown an impressive range of abilities, such as the capability to process several streams of data at once, and displaying knowledge on a wide range of subjects ranging from politics to astrophysics.

SCP-9084 refuses to accept the fact that it is not human, and may become offended if the issue of its robotic nature arises. However, it has an amiable and cooperative nature, and displays unerring loyalty to the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-9084 has been permitted limited interaction with personnel outside of research purposes, and has been found to be an active participant in social settings. In one case, it was credited for defusing a tense situation by engaging the agitated members in a debate on journalistic techniques. Nonetheless, due to its nature as a sentient intelligence and its desire for adventure, monitoring and strict adherence to containment procedures are necessary.
