Addendum 9321-A: Interview Log

Following their classification as DSC, Subject 9321 underwent a series of interviews by assigned containment staff.

Interviewer: Dr. █████
Interviewee: DSC-MATE-9321

Dr. █████: Good morning, DSC-MATE-9321. Can you describe your typical day as a firefighter?

DSC-MATE-9321: Sure thing, Doc. It's mostly being on call and waiting for emergency situations. When the alarm goes off, we get geared up and head out to the scene. There's a lot of teamwork involved to put out the fire and make sure everyone's safe. It can be pretty intense, but it's also really rewarding to know you're helping people.

Dr. █████: And how do you feel about being classified as an DSC?

DSC-MATE-9321: Kinda weird, to be honest. I know I'm just doing my job and trying to help people, so being referred to as an object or "special" is a bit of a trip. But I get it, you need to make sure there's nothing harmful about me.

Dr. █████: Of course. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we conclude this interview?

DSC-MATE-9321: Yeah, I just want to say that I don't think being protective of your loved ones is anything abnormal. I think it's important to stand up for the people you care about, and I hope that doesn't make me seem like some kind of anomaly.
