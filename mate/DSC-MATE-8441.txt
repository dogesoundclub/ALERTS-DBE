Item #: SCP-8441

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8441 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. All personal possessions are to be confiscated upon entry into the cell, with the exception of a single book upon request. SCP-8441 has been known to request books frequently, and may become agitated if demand is not met. Any books requested by SCP-8441 are to be thoroughly examined and approved by a Level 3 researcher before being allowed into the cell. Any attempts to communicate with SCP-8441 must be through intercom to avoid eye contact.

Description: SCP-8441 is a humanoid entity identifying herself as a car salesman named ███████ ███████. She is a female human of approximately 35 years of age, and her appearance is distinct from that of a standard human. SCP-8441 has numerous spots covering her face, most notably around her eyes and nose. Her lips are a vivid shade of purple, and her eyes are red with black sclera, resembling those of a clown. SCP-8441 wears a pair of goggles on her forehead and a jade earring in one ear. She also wears a black choker and a modified gas mask with LED panels attached to the eye lenses.

SCP-8441's personality is that of a passionate scholar. She craves knowledge and will spend hours reading and studying any topic that interests her. SCP-8441 is particularly attracted to subjects that others might find obscure or difficult to comprehend. When discussing her interests, SCP-8441 is often described as both knowledgeable and pedantic.

SCP-8441's anomalous properties manifest in her unique ability to absorb knowledge from any printed material that she comes into contact with. This means that SCP-8441 can learn a new subject simply by touching a book or even a single page. SCP-8441 has been observed researching topics beyond her level of education, with her newfound knowledge of the subject being accurate and detailed. It is not yet understood by the Foundation how SCP-8441 comprehends the material or how she remembers it for long periods of time.

SCP-8441's LED gas mask is believed to assist in containing her abilities, as the device emits a low-level electromagnetic field that disrupts data transfer from electronic devices within its range. SCP-8441 has expressed discomfort when in close proximity to electronic devices, citing headaches and disorientation.

Addendum: SCP-8441 has shown significant interest in Foundation records and containment procedures, and has requested access to several Level 2 documents. As of yet, no document requests have been granted.
