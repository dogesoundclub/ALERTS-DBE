Item #: 5992

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5992 is to be monitored at all times from a remote location via CCTV. Any attempts by civilians to approach the subject must be deterred by assigned task forces. All interactions with this individual must be carried out remotely through a secure communication system.

Description: Subject 5992 is a human male in his late 20s, commonly seen patrolling the streets as a traffic officer. He stands at a height of 5'11" and weighs approximately 165 lbs. He has orange stripes etched on his cheeks and a seemingly contagious smile on his lips which, when coupled with his VR rainbow LED eyes, can be quite unsettling to observe.

Subject 5992 accessorizes with a purple cap with a headset, green cross earring, gold chain, and an LED gas mask. Despite the peculiar appearance, he is quite friendly and relatable, with a great sense of humor that can easily uplift others' spirits. He's known for telling humorous stories and doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood.

Noteworthy about this particular human, he seems to have a hidden agenda while on his traffic rounds. He avoids engaging with others directly and will often fade into the background when he believes no one is watching. Further investigation into his behavior is necessary to ascertain the reason for his secrecy.

Addendum: In light of recent events, Subject 5992 has been upgraded from Safe to Euclid status. It has come to the attention of the foundation that the subject can manipulate his LED gas mask to emit a bright flash of light, which he has used to escape dangerous situations unharmed. It's unclear whether this ability can be triggered intentionally, and so all personnel are to exercise extreme caution during interactions with Subject 5992.
