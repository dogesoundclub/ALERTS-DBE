Item #: SCP-3805

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3805 is to be housed in humanoid containment room 12-B at Site-██. SCP-3805 has been provided with various artistic tools and materials to express their creative side. Any changes in behavior or unusual activity must be recorded and reported immediately to the assigned containment supervisor.

Description: SCP-3805 is a male rabbit species standing at 1.2 meters tall. They are commonly seen wearing a purple cap with vibrant green hair protruding from underneath. Their frightened mouth, combined with their rainbow LED vision, makes SCP-3805 appear anxious and paranoid. SCP-3805 is known to have a goggle and jade earring as forehead and ear features respectively. SCP-3805 also wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-3805 has a highly creative and artistic personality, which is expressed through various forms of art such as drawing, painting, and writing. SCP-3805 enjoys exploring new mediums and techniques and often incorporates these discoveries into their art.

SCP-3805's unique appearance and personality were discovered when they were brought to the Foundation for medical treatment. SCP-3805 worked as a doctor at a local medical center and had been discovered to have the ability to heal various diseases and ailments in humans, animals, and other SCPs.

SCP-3805's abilities have been extensively studied and continue to baffle researchers. It is unclear how SCP-3805 is able to heal, as their species and medical training do not account for their remarkable abilities. SCP-3805 is unable to heal themselves or other rabbits of their species.

SCP-3805's artistic abilities and healing powers have made them a valuable asset to the Foundation. However, their paranoid and anxiety-ridden personality has made interactions with other SCPs and personnel difficult at times. SCP-3805 is prone to panic attacks and should be approached with caution.

Addendum: SCP-3805 requested to create a mural on their containment room wall as part of their artistic expression. The request was approved and the mural has been reported to have a calming effect on SCP-3805's anxiety. It is recommended that SCP containment rooms be personalized to improve the mental health and behavior of SCPs.
