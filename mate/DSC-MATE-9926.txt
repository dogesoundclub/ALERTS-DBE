SCP-9926 is an anomalous human electrician with the peculiar appearance of VR Rainbow LED eyes and blonde hair with a wing. SCP-9926 is often seen wearing a choker and gold earring, which adds to its mystical air. A distinguishing feature of SCP-9926 is the presence of spots on its face, which are thought to signify some unknown supernatural trait.

Personality-wise, SCP-9926 can be quite impulsive and tends to act on its emotions without considering the consequences. This has led to some amusing incidents where SCP-9926 made spontaneous decisions that caught others off guard. While this behavior can be problematic at times, SCP-9926's apparent supernatural abilities more than make up for any inconvenience. SCP-9926 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, and we must ensure that it is kept under close supervision to prevent any mishap.
