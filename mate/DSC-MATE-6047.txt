Item #: SCP-6047

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6047 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its profession as a lawyer, SCP-6047 is allowed limited access to legal texts and documents, though all materials must be screened by Foundation personnel beforehand. SCP-6047 must wear its LED gas mask at all times when outside of the containment chamber.

Description: SCP-6047 is a male tiger, appearing to be of Indian sub-species origin. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 180 kilograms. Its most notable facial feature is its permanently frightened mouth, seemingly signaling constantly apprehensive behavior. SCP-6047's eyes resemble ski goggles, and its head is adorned with a bucket hat, with an additional goggle placed atop its forehead.

SCP-6047 often wears a gold chain as an accessory, despite any potential security concerns. Its most defining feature, however, is its LED gas mask, which it wears at all times when outside of its containment chamber. The mask is equipped with a voice modulator, which SCP-6047 uses to communicate with Foundation personnel.

SCP-6047's personality is that of a highly practical and hands-on individual, with a tendency to fix things in unconventional ways. It is noted for its ability to rig up makeshift solutions to solve complex problems. However, this may also lead to overconfidence in its abilities, leading to potential safety hazards.

Addendum: Foundation personnel have reported that SCP-6047 seems to have a compulsive need to constantly fiddle with its LED gas mask. Further research is required to determine the reasoning behind this behavior.
