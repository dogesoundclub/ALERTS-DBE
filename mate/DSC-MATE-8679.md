She sports piercing red clown eyes that tend to distract onlookers, along with an emerald-green head that curls sharply at the edges. A curious addition to her forehead is a two-color band that appears to glow when she is excited.

She accessorizes with a gold earring and a choker that seems to hold some sentimental value. DSC-MATE-8679's most prominent trait is her natural charm and charisma. She effortlessly makes connections with others and can be the life of any gathering, often telling jokes or doing silly dances to lighten the mood.
