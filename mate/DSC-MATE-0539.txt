Item #: 539

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-539 is currently working as a lawyer at ███████ Law firm. Foundation agents embedded in the firm are to monitor SCP-539's activities to ensure that he does not disclose any sensitive information about the Foundation. SCP-539 is also required to report to the Foundation for regular check-ups.

Description: SCP-539 is a male monkey of the species [REDACTED]. SCP-539 has blue clown eyes, which are an unusual feature for its species. SCP-539 is often seen wearing a police cap on its head along with a goggle on its forehead. SCP-539 is fond of accessorizing and is often seen wearing a gold earring, a red scarf, and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-539 exhibits an unusual personality trait for a monkey. It is very caring and nurturing and often anthropomorphizes inanimate objects, giving them names and personalities. SCP-539 talks to its plants, household appliances, and vehicles, often treating them as if they were alive. This behavior has caused some concern among the Foundation agents embedded in the law firm where SCP-539 works.

Addendum: The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-539 after he successfully represented a suspect in a criminal case that the Foundation was involved in. SCP-539 later disclosed sensitive information to the suspect, leading to his escape. The Foundation has since placed SCP-539 under surveillance and has restricted his access to sensitive information.
