Item #: DSC-MATE-9067

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9067 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Due to her unusual appearance, all personnel who interact with DSC-MATE-9067 are required to wear protective goggles during communication. DSC-MATE-9067 is allowed access to a small collection of pet animals that she cares for under supervision by Foundation personnel. Any attempts to remove or damage DSC-MATE-9067's bucket hat are strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-9067 is a human female with a striking facial feature of bright red lips and blue clown eyes. She wears a bucket hat on her head and gold earrings on her ears, along with a silver chain. DSC-MATE-9067 works as a veterinarian and has a particular affinity for animals, often displaying contagious enthusiasm for her work. However, DSC-MATE-9067's personality also displays a rebellious streak, leading to her intentionally breaking rules and finding loopholes in protocols. This behavior has resulted in several amusing and harmless situations.

DSC-MATE-9067's anomalous properties include the ability to manipulate animals' behavior by whispering calming or soothing words, to the point of gaining trust and control over them. She is also capable of healing minor wounds on animals by mere contact with her hands, though this ability has not been successfully replicated on human test subjects.

DSC-MATE-9067 was discovered by Foundation operatives during an incident involving multiple escaped animals from a local zoo. Since containment, she has proven useful in aiding the Foundation's animal containment and research divisions.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9067 has repeatedly requested to interact with "cuter" and more "exotic" animals, claiming that it would "make work more interesting." All such requests have been denied, and DSC-MATE-9067 has been reprimanded for attempting to bypass containment procedures. Monitoring of her rebellious tendencies will continue.
