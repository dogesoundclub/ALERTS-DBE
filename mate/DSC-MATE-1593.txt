Item #: SCP-1593

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1593 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit, with reinforced walls and ceiling to accommodate for its size. The containment unit must be equipped with a heavy-duty air filtration system and remotely-controlled mechanical system, in case it becomes necessary to subdue SCP-1593. At no point is any personnel, human or otherwise, to interact with SCP-1593 alone, until granted clearance through approval from Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-1593 is a bipedal tiger standing approximately 6ft tall when on its hind legs. It appears to be of the Bengal Tiger species, but with a number of notable differences, including the VR Rainbow LED eyes, Doge Hat on its head, Jade Earring on the left ear, and Gold Chain around its neck. It is often seen wearing a Normal Gas Mask, though this does not seem to impede its ability to breathe. SCP-1593 speaks fluent English, and has been cooperative with personnel since initial containment.

SCP-1593 is the anomaly in the Foundation with one of the most humorous personalities on record. It displays a nurturing, caring side that is often humorous when it treats friends and family as if they were its own children. Its behavior has been difficult to predict based on standard animal behavior, something that has been observed multiple times in testing. Nonetheless, SCP-1593 has been cooperative with the Foundation since containment.


Addendum: SCP-1593 was recovered after several urban residents reported sightings of a "talking tiger" assisting with car engines and other mechanical tasks. Reports claimed that the animal didnâ€™t attack humans or show any signs of aggression. Foundation agents were immediately dispatched to the location and SCP-1593 was subsequently contained without incident. Further investigation revealed that SCP-1593 had taken to working as an independent Mechanic in the area.
