Item #: 9031

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9031 is to be monitored by Foundation agents while maintaining a cover story as a regular train driver. Any deviation from normal activity must immediately be reported to the Foundation. DSC-MATE-9031 has been instructed to report all anomalous activity it witnesses on board trains to contain breaches or illegal activity.

Description: DSC-MATE-9031 is a human male, approximately 35 years old, with orange stripes on their face. It possesses green cross earrings and a red scarf. DSC-MATE-9031 has an affinity for smoking and carries a cigarette at all times. DSC-MATE-9031 is a train driver for a metro rail transit system in [REDACTED]. It is generally friendly but is known to be a scatterbrain, a common trait among some humans.

DSC-MATE-9031's memory lapse and tendency to get sidetracked are attributed to its inability to focus, especially when confronted with new information. Additionally, this leads to frequent mistakes being made, such as arriving at wrong stations, making wrong stops, or, in some instances, driving trains in the wrong direction. Despite its idiosyncrasies, DSC-MATE-9031 has a stable mental outlook and does not pose any threat to the general public or Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-9031 only shows anomalous activity with a cargo of anomalous nature or with other DSCs on board. Train drivers outside DSC-MATE-9031's line of control report strange and unprecedented activity as it passes, such as train signals triggering without apparent cause or waving of lights that are not meant to relay any message.

DSC-MATE-9031 is unaware of its unique abilities and has been informed of its role in reporting anomalous activity to the Foundation. DSC-MATE-9031 is cooperative and continues to operate regularly without hindrance to the general populace.

Addendum 9031-01: DSC-MATE-9031 experienced a severe derailment incident while carrying a shipment of illegal DSC-carrying cargo. A full inspection of the train and the tracks revealed no evidence of anomalies. However, DSC-MATE-9031 displayed strange wounds resembling claw marks on its back. The wound was not caused by any normal creature. The origin and cause of the wounds are unknown, and the Foundation is conducting a full investigation of the incident.
