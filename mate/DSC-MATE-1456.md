Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1456 is to be constantly monitored for any signs of uncontrolled behavior.

Description: DSC-MATE-1456 appears to be a human female in her mid-twenties, with bright orange eyebrows and blond hair. She possesses what appears to be a pair of wings attached to her head, and a green cross earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-1456 generally wears a medical mask, which may be linked to a psychological compulsion.

Of particular note is her smile. DSC-MATE-1456's smile is known to have a strange effect on individuals within a certain radius. This phenomenon has been studied extensively and is believed to result from a subconscious empathic manipulation ability, though the exact mechanism for this ability remains unknown.

DSC-MATE-1456 is also known to wear a gold chain and may exhibit risky behaviors in order to show off, particularly in social situations. She has demonstrated a tendency to act before thinking things through, which can lead to minor accidents or other mishaps. Her personality is generally reckless, with a disinclination towards rules and regulations.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1456 has been employed by the Foundation as a fashion designer in order to exploit her anomalous capabilities for covert operations. In exchange for her cooperation, DSC-MATE-1456 has been given access to a wider range of clothing and accessories for her personal use. So long as she remains under controlled conditions and continues to cooperate with the Foundation, DSC-MATE-1456 is not deemed a significant threat.
