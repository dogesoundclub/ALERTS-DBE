Item Number: 2481

Object Class: Humanoid

Description: 2481 is a male human of average height and build. His most notable feature is the orange stripes on his face, which contrast against his otherwise unremarkable features. His mouth is usually held in a frightened expression and he wears normal glasses on his eyes. A blue bandana can always be found atop his head, and a jade earring is present on one of his ears. He wears a red scarf as an accessory.

2481 is employed as an electrician and has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This can sometimes lead to moments of disorganization and forgetfulness as he tries to take on too much at once. This makes for humorous situations where he struggles to fit everything he needs to do in a single day or attempts to carry too many objects at once.

As of yet, there have been no reports of any anomalous activity associated with 2481.
