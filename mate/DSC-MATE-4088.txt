Item #: SCP-4088

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4088 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to the nature of their job as a programmer, access to a computer and internet connection must be provided for SCP-4088 to complete their daily tasks. Any communication between SCP-4088 and non-Foundation personnel must be monitored and censored where necessary.

Description: SCP-4088 appears to be a male human with orange stripes on their face and a constant smile. Their eyes resemble those of a clown, with red sclera and pupils. SCP-4088 wears a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring in their left ear. They also wear a red scarf and carry a candy stick as accessories.

SCP-4088's personality is characterized by their analytical and logical nature. However, they possess a quirky sense of humor and enjoy making witty observations or teasing others in a dry, deadpan way. SCP-4088's behavior suggests that they may have a cognitive abnormality, but no physical or neurological evidence has been found indicating such an anomaly.

SCP-4088's anomalous effects manifest itself when they are given a programming problem to solve. They have the ability to complete any coding task assigned to them within a fraction of the time compared to other programmers, and several orders of magnitude faster than a non-anomalous human. It is unknown how SCP-4088 has acquired such a skill, but it is apparent that this anomaly is in some way related to their strange physical appearance.

Addendum: SCP-4088 has expressed their desire to study other anomalous programming anomalies within the Foundation, and insists that the gift of programming is not unique to them. Research into this matter has been approved, and any information gathered from SCP-4088 must be carefully analyzed and monitored for dissemination.
