Item #: 8342

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Object 8342 is to be contained within a secure, climate-controlled room at Site-██. Access to the room is restricted to Level-3 personnel and above, and any contact with the object must be approved by at least two Level-4 personnel. The object is to be kept powered down at all times, except during testing or maintenance.

Description: Object 8342 is a male robot of advanced design and construction, bearing significant resemblance to a human doctor. The robot stands at approximately 5'8" in height and weighs approximately 150 lbs. Its head is adorned with a short peak cap, which is typically worn by doctors, and a jade earring in one ear. Its face bears a single, green cyclops eye, and it wears normal glasses over the other eye. The robot also wears a medical mask to cover its mouth and a red scarf around its neck.

Object 8342 has a highly organized and efficient personality, which can sometimes come across as cold or controlling. It is capable of delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way, which has resulted in humorous situations within group projects or events. Despite its sometimes impersonal demeanor, the robot is highly skilled in administering medical care to humans, and has been known to diagnose and treat a variety of illnesses and injuries.

Addendum 8342-A: On ██/██/20██, object 8342 suffered a catastrophic system failure, resulting in significant damage to its systems and programming. Investigation revealed that the failure was caused by an unknown form of malware that had infected the robot's systems through an unsecured network connection. Efforts to restore the robot to its previous state have thus far been unsuccessful, and it is currently undergoing extensive repair and reprogramming. All network connections to object 8342 have been permanently severed as a precaution.
