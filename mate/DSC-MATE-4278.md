Item #: 4278

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4278 is to be allowed freedom of movement within the confines of its occupation. Any attempts to restrict or limit this movement must be approved by a Level 2 personnel. DSC-MATE-4278 must be monitored closely for any unusual behavior or activity, and any deviations from its normal routine must be reported immediately. 

Description: DSC-MATE-4278 appears as a young human female, with striking orange stripes on its face combined with a distinctive purple lip. DSC-MATE-4278 has blonde hair with a large wing protruding from the right side of the head, possibly a result of genetics or anomalous mutation. The subject's ears are adorned with a single red-cross earring. Additionally, its personality is distinctly nurturing and empathetic, willing to care for friends and family at any cost.

DSC-MATE-4278's ability to nurture borders on the anomalous, as it is reported that the subject's maternal instincts have extended to both animate and inanimate objects. DSC-MATE-4278 has been reported to take small animals, such as rodents, under its care, and will go to lengths to protect and raise them as its own offspring. This has led to DSC-MATE-4278 treating some of its favorite fast food menu items with similar reverence and care, however contemptuously displaying those it dislikes. 

DSC-MATE-4278's work in a fast-food chain is a plausible cover, especially as it provides the subject with the opportunity to meet and nurture fellow anomalies. DSC-MATE-4278 has shown a remarkable amount of loyalty to the establishment and its staff, leading to speculation that there may be further anomalous effects influencing the subject's behavior. 

Addendum 4278-1: DSC-MATE-4278 was recovered from a fast food establishment in California. Local urban fantasy agencies had reported the prior existence of a winged and maternal creature operating within the fast food industry. The site was investigated, and DSC-MATE-4278 was found performing melodramatic acts of nurturing for the restaurant's inanimate decor. DogeSoundClub agents were called in to secure the subject, and a cover story was issued to the public to control the spread of anomalous rumors. 

Addendum 4278-2: It is noted that DSC-MATE-4278 and DSC-999 have developed a friendship since DSC-MATE-4278 has begun working at the fast food establishment. DSC-MATE-4278 has attempted to care for DSC-999 on several occasions, leading to various records of DSC-MATE-4278's attempts at raising the small bodied DSC to alarming levels. DSC-MATE-4278 is to be monitored when in the presence of DSC-999 and further interaction is to be carefully monitored.
