Item#: 1108

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1108 is to be allowed to continue their occupation as a beautician, although regular check-ins with a trained therapist are required to ensure their empathy levels are not causing any harm to their mental state. Subject is to be kept at least 10ft away from any known aggressive entities, as their strong empathetic nature may incite these entities.

Description: Subject 1108 is a humanoid-being identified as a human male. They stand at 6ft in height and possess a distinct feature of orange stripes across their face. Their eyes are described as "ski goggles" and they are always seen wearing a hoodie coupled with a silver chain and cigarettes as an accessory.

Personality and Traits: Subject 1108 possesses an outstandingly strong sense of empathy higher than the average human. They have shown the ability to easily read and interpret the emotions of others, often resulting in the diffusing of otherwise critical situations. Subject 1108's empathetic nature can cause them to become overwhelmed and emotionally drained, leading to emotional instability.

Addendum: Subject 1108's ability to detect and counteract negative emotions in others has spurred interest in its potential use as a containment measure for certain DSCs. Testing is currently underway to determine the full extent of this possibility.
