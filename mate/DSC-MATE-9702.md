Item #: DSC-MATE-9702

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9702 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any attempts at escape or removal of its anomalous items should be met with non-lethal force.

Description: DSC-MATE-9702 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. It displays exceptional intelligence, with the ability to communicate fluently in English and possess knowledge beyond that of a typical primate. Its species is currently unknown, as no known monkey species have been recorded with the features exhibited by DSC-MATE-9702.

DSC-MATE-9702 works under the guise of a real estate agent, operating under the name ██████ ███████. It has been recorded to have made several successful sales, despite several complaints of irregularities with its listings. DSC-MATE-9702 wears a police cap and goggles on its forehead, a gold earring on each ear, a silver chain around its neck, and an LED gas mask.

DSC-MATE-9702 displays a strong sense of independence and self-preservation, leading to a reluctance to ask for help, even when it is clearly needed. This has caused several humorous situations, including instances of DSC-MATE-9702 physically attempting to move furniture by itself, and refusing to use a map even when lost.

DSC-MATE-9702's anomalous properties are linked to its accessories. The silver chain suppresses its innate ability to break the laws of physics, while the gas mask enhances its physical strength beyond that of a normal primate. Any attempts at removing or tampering with these items result in the immediate activation of their anomalous effects.

Addendum: Due to the extreme caution exhibited by DSC-MATE-9702, it is believed to possess knowledge of containment procedures and the existence of the DogeSoundClub. It is recommended that all personnel refrain from discussing such topics in its presence.
