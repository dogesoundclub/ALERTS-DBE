Item #: 5109

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5109 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to a private office space furnished to their liking. Any visitors must be approved by Foundation operatives and should be accompanied at all times.

Description: SCP-5109 is a male rabbit humanoid with jade LED eyes and a headset with LED that covers its ears. It stands at 1.2 meters tall and weighs approximately 35 pounds. SCP-5109 works as a real estate agent, where he is known for his bold salesmanship and fast-paced talking style. SCP-5109 is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking cigarettes.

SCP-5109 has a distinctive, frightened mouth, and his facial expressions can be used to interpret his mood, as he lacks the ability to speak. SCP-5109 has a dry sense of humor, which he often employs to catch his clients off guard. He is known for delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny.

SCP-5109 is intelligent and cunning, using his unique abilities to manipulate and deceive others for his own gain. He is well-aware of his situation and sees the Foundation as a potential threat to his interests. SCP-5109 is trained in manipulation tactics and is capable of misdirecting attention from his true intentions.

Addendum: Following Incident 5109-01, in which SCP-5109 attempted to sell Dr. ██████ his containment chamber and threatened to expose the Foundation's existence, all communications with SCP-5109 must be conducted via written notes, voice modulators, or telepathy to avoid potential manipulations.
