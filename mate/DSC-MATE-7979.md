Item #: DSC-MATE-7979

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7979 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Due to DSC-MATE-7979's occupation as a firefighter, a cover story has been established regarding her absence from work. Any incidents involving the use of DSC-MATE-7979's abilities in public must be swiftly contained and class A amnestics administered to any witnesses.

Description: DSC-MATE-7979 appears to be a human female of approximately 25 years old. She has blonde hair with an ethereal-like wing on her head and jewelry to accentuate her features. Her face is speckled with spots, and she has orange eyebrows with bright red lipstick. DSC-MATE-7979 is commonly seen wearing a black choker around her neck and frequently using a cigarette for unknown reasons.

DSC-MATE-7979 possesses the ability to control fire at will, which has been observed to manifest from her wings. Her control over flame can range from lighting a match to generating a full-blown inferno. She is resistant to high temperatures and is immune to burns, which is believed to be due to her anomalous abilities.

DSC-MATE-7979 has been observed as having a strong sense of independence, and she is known to be stubborn and reluctant to ask for help when needed. Her personality has led to a few humorous situations, such as attempting to move heavy objects by herself or refusing to use a map when lost.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7979 was brought to the Foundation's attention after her firefighting team encountered a large blaze that was seemingly impossible to extinguish. DSC-MATE-7979 was observed walking directly into the flames, and it was then that her anomalous abilities were discovered. The Foundation swiftly took her into custody, and a cover story was established to explain her sudden absence from work.
