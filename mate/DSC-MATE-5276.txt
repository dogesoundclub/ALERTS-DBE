SCP-5276, codenamed "The Joker", is a human female security guard with unique facial features that are considered abnormal by human standards. The subject's face is covered in spots, and her lips are a shade of vivid purple that appears to glow in low light environments. The most striking feature of the SCP-5276's face is her eyes; her sclera is black, while her irises are a bright, garish red that resembles those of a clown. 

The subject appears to be constantly in a state of mirth, with an almost permanent grin tugging at the corners of her purple lips. Additionally, she wears a pair of goggles on her forehead and a green cross earring in each ear; these, along with her gold chain, contribute to her offbeat appearance. 

SCP-5276's personality can be described as eccentric, with an unusual sense of humor that can be disarming to those not familiar with her. However, her deadpan delivery of jokes can catch even the most stoic of individuals off-guard. Despite this, she does not consider herself to be particularly outgoing and prefers to keep to herself. 

It should be noted that SCP-5276 displays no abnormal behavior beyond her appearance and sense of humor, and poses no known threat to containment or personnel. However, due to her unusual features, interactions with civilian personnel are to be limited to a minimum.
