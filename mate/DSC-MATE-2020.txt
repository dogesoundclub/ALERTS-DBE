Item #: SCP-2020

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2020 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. SCP-2020 is allowed access to all areas of the facility that are designated for human personnel. SCP-2020 is permitted to continue its job as a Theater Manager, provided that it does not disclose any information regarding the Foundation or its contents.

Description: SCP-2020 is a female human with unusual features that set it apart from ordinary humans. It has orange stripes on its face, with red clown eyes and a red lip. SCP-2020 also has a jade earring and a silver chain that it wears around its neck. The most notable feature is the two-color band on its forehead, which appears to have a hieroglyphic symbol engraved on it.

SCP-2020 exhibits a highly social and outgoing personality, often seeking attention and entertaining others through humorous stories and jokes. This personality trait may have been amplified due to its unusual appearance, which attracts people's attention wherever it goes. SCP-2020's laughter has been observed to cause a euphoric effect in those around it, but this effect only lasts a short period and is not considered hazardous.

SCP-2020 has not exhibited any anomalous properties or abilities at this time. However, due to its unique appearance and personality, it is recommended that Foundation personnel exercise caution and avoid engaging in prolonged social interactions with SCP-2020 to prevent any unintended effects from occurring.

Addendum: SCP-2020 has expressed interest in participating in theatrical performances and has requested access to Foundation resources and personnel. This request has been denied, as SCP-2020's anomalous effects on audiences are unknown and could potentially lead to a breach of containment.
