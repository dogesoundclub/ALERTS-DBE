Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3532 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a one-way observation mirror. All personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-3532 must have a thorough psychological evaluation before and after their shifts. They are not allowed to engage with DSC-MATE-3532 beyond professional communication.

Description: DSC-MATE-3532 is a human woman in her late twenties, standing at 5'5" (165 cm) tall with a slim build. DSC-MATE-3532 has blue clown eyes, with a metal blue head and one purple lip. Their appearance is very distinctive and unlikely to be mistaken for any other individual. DSC-MATE-3532 also carries a cigarette with them at all times.

DSC-MATE-3532 is a programmer by profession and shows no anomalous behavior in this field. However, DSC-MATE-3532 has a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood.

DSC-MATE-3532's humor, however, is often unpredictable, with many jokes being in poor taste or inappropriate for the situation. DSC-MATE-3532 has been known to make jokes about containment breaches or other serious matters, leading to disciplinary action. DSC-MATE-3532's personality has been described as erratic, with rapid mood swings from joyful to melancholy and back again.

DSC-MATE-3532's anomalous ability manifests in their sense of humor. DSC-MATE-3532 has the power to warp reality with their laughter, causing physical changes to the environment around them. DSC-MATE-3532 is able to create an infinite amount of constructs, some of which can be destructive if not monitored.

DSC-MATE-3532's humor thus poses a significant threat and must be contained. DSC-MATE-3532 is to be kept under strict observation at all times, with all conversations recorded and analyzed by personnel trained in handling humor anomalies. Any personnel susceptible to DSC-MATE-3532's humor should avoid contact with DSC-MATE-3532 as much as possible.
