SCP-8162 has been identified as the current leader of a well-known organized crime syndicate, with operations spanning across multiple cities. Known only as "The Boss," SCP-8162's natural charm and charisma has allowed them to rise to power within the criminal underworld. SCP-8162's methods of maintaining control over their organization are currently unknown, but it is believed to involve extensive use of violence and intimidation.

It is important to note that SCP-8162's charismatic personality extends beyond their criminal dealings.
