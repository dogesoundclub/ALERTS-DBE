Item #: 533

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-533 is to be monitored by Foundation agents within his daily life as a real estate agent. Document any abnormal behavior or interactions with non-anomalous humans.

Description: SCP-533 is a male human with an extraordinary appearance. He has a unique mouth spot and a clown mouth, with blue clown eyes. His hair is green and not arranged, and he wears a gold earring in his left ear. SCP-533 usually adorns a red scarf and carries a cigarette with him at all times.

SCP-533's personality makes him unpredictable and challenging to understand. He has an affinity for logic and analysis, making him an ideal debater. In cases where others perceive the topic as trivial or unimportant, SCP-533 has been known to engage in heated debates that lead to unexpected outcomes.

SCP-533's anomalous properties are still being researched. However, his ability to persuade and influence others has been documented on numerous occasions. His interactions with other SCPs are currently being observed to determine if there are any connections.

Addendum: SCP-533's real estate business has been a way for him to spread anomalous properties through the properties he sells. Foundation agents must continue to monitor his sales and restrict the distribution of any anomalous substances or objects.
