Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5685 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Due to its ability to communicate, interaction with SCP-5685 is permitted only with the supervision of at least one level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-5685 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth and a pair of horned rim glasses that serve no apparent function. It also carries a whistle at all times. Surprisingly, SCP-5685 possesses a degree of intelligence that allows it to speak in several languages, including English, Spanish, and French.

SCP-5685 works as a real estate agent under Foundation supervision, and it has proven to be a very capable asset. Despite its species, SCP-5685 possesses a great penchant towards learning and exploring different aspects of human society. Its curiosity can lead to some humorous situations, as SCP-5685 will randomly interject obscure facts or trivia during conversations.

SCP-5685 has shown no signs of aggression or hostility towards staff members. It's a generally friendly creature, eager to make new friends and explore new concepts. However, it has shown an unusual preference for studying paranormal phenomena, which has led to several debates with Foundation researchers.

Addendum: SCP-5685 has expressed an interest in creating a real estate portfolio of anomalous properties, which has raised concerns among Foundation personnel. While monitored, SCP-5685 is not allowed to access any anomalous sites or artifacts unsupervised. Further studies are ongoing.
