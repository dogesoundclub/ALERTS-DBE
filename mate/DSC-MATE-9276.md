Description: Subject 9276 appears to be a human female with orange stripes on her face, displaying an unnaturally wide smile. Her eyes are a bright, unnerving red color, reminiscent of a clown. Her unkempt green-tinted hair frames her forehead, which is adorned by a pair of goggles. She wears a pair of gold earrings and a silver chain around her neck, as well as always carrying a cigarette.

However, she seems to channel this obsession into unexpected areas of her life, such as color-coding her closets or meticulously organizing her spice rack. She maintains a friendly and amiable demeanor in social situations, but often shows a lack of empathy for those around her, indicating a possible sociopathic tendency.
