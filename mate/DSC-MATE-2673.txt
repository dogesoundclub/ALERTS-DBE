Item#: 2673
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2673 is currently to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Access to communication devices is permitted only with express permission from an authorized Level 3 personnel. No aerosolized substances of any kind are permitted inside the containment chamber.

Description: Subject 2673 is a female human of average height and weight, with distinctive orange stripes on her face. She exhibits a permanently affixed grin with red clown eyes, further accentuated by a bucket hat adorned with a two-color band on her forehead. Her ears are pierced with a red cross earring, and she often can be found smoking a cigarette, which does not appear to have any effect on her physical health or well-being. Subject 2673 presents as a well-adjusted individual with a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards the patients she treats in her position as a doctor. However, she exhibits a marked personality trait for the enjoyment of life and bringing fun to others.  

When engaged in pleasant activities or play, subject 2673's grin and demeanor become even more pronounced, often leading to her becoming the center of attention, and encouraging others to participate in their activities. It should be noted, however, that when serious issues are at hand, or when the need for her medical expertise arises, Subject 2673 immediately shifts into a professional setting and presents herself as a medical care provider with knowledge and expertise in her field. 

Addendum 2673-A: Subject 2673's origins are currently unknown. It is believed, however, that her anomalous properties manifested during her development in the womb or during early infancy. Further research is ongoing to determine the extent of her capabilities and any further effects they may have on the human body.
