SCP-7779, known as "The Harebrained Lawyer," is a humanoid entity that takes the form of a male rabbit. Its body is covered in thick, white fur, and it stands at approximately 3 feet in height. In place of the typical eyes found in rabbits, SCP-7779 possesses bright red clown eyes, which give off a mesmerizing effect to those who gaze upon them for an extended period of time.

One defining characteristic of SCP-7779 is the two color band across its forehead, which is a distinctive feature that varies in hue depending on its mood. When focused on a task, the band becomes a vibrant green, while during moments of stress, it changes to a deep purple.

Additionally, SCP-7779 is fond of accessorizing its body, as it is often seen wearing a single, glimmering jade earring on its left ear. The entity is known to be a helpful and nurturing individual, with a personality that is caring and empathetic. This trait often leads SCP-7779 to offer assistance to others, sometimes to the point of taking care of individuals as if they were its own children.

Despite its gentle demeanor, SCP-7779 possesses keen legal abilities, often taking on cases that have significant implications on the supernatural world. Its legal experience has also proved useful in navigating bureaucratic systems and assisting other entities with legal matters.

As with all humanoid entities, interaction with SCP-7779 must be approached with caution. While its nature is benign, prolonged exposure to its clown eyes can have a detrimental effect on an individual's cognitive abilities. It is recommended to limit contact with SCP-7779 to short intervals to prevent any unintended consequences.
