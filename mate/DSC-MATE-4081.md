Item #: 4081

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4081 is to be contained in its designated office space at [REDACTED] News Network. DSC-MATE-4081 is allowed to continue its job as a news anchor as it poses no threat to the secrecy of the Foundation. However, all scripts, teleprompters, and related work products must be inspected for anomalous content prior to broadcast. DSC-MATE-4081 is not to be made aware of its anomalous properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-4081 is a female human news anchor with orange stripes on its face, purple lips, blond hair in an ushanka, green cross earrings, and a silver chain around its neck. Its eyes are normal, and it wears prescription glasses.

DSC-MATE-4081 is known to be absent-minded and forgetful, particularly when working on a project or lost in thought, a trait it often exposes on-air. As a result, DSC-MATE-4081 sometimes misses important appointments or loses track of time for significant events.

DSC-MATE-4081's anomalous effect is the ability to influence written or spoken language within its presence. This effect causes the language to be altered to match DSC-MATE-4081's thoughts, often manifesting as humorous puns or unexpected outcomes. For instance, during a broadcast discussing a dangerous storm, the anchors' warning turned into a comedic scenario wherein viewers were warned of "the raining cats and dogs."

Addendum: Following Incident 4081-01, where an on-air anchor experienced its anomalous effect and broadcast forced Foundation secrets, it is of utmost importance to carefully monitor all scripts, teleprompters, and related work products prior to broadcast. No personnel are to communicate with DSC-MATE-4081 until further notice.
