Addendum: Incident Report

On ████-██-██, DSC-MATE-5640 escaped its containment chamber during a routine check for equipment maintenance. DSC-MATE-5640 managed to subdue several armed guards and made its way to the highway, where it stole a car from a civilian.

DSC-MATE-5640 was intercepted shortly thereafter by a team of MTF agents who arrived in time to follow it into a local park. DSC-MATE-5640 led the agents directly to the source of the reported anomaly. Thanks to DSC-MATE-5640, the agents were able to contain the anomaly, which otherwise might have caused significant collateral damage.

Upon recontaining DSC-MATE-5640, Project Head Dr. ██████ recommended that it be promoted to Level-2 Research Personnel and began study of its abilities. The recommendation was approved by the Site Director on the basis of the success of the containment effort.
