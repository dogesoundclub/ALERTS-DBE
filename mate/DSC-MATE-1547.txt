SCP-1547: The Primate Guard

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1547 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell furnished with comfortable bedding, toys, and other amenities suitable for their species. Routine check-ups and veterinarian visits are required to maintain their physical and mental health. However, all personnel entering their containment cell must undergo a full-body cavity search to ensure that no unauthorized items come into contact with SCP-1547.

Description: SCP-1547 is a male monkey of unknown origin, standing at 3 feet in height and weighing approximately 30 pounds. They possess a distinctive mohawk hairstyle and wear a single jade earring in each ear. One notable feature is the red scarf that they wear around their neck, which has become their signature accessory of sorts. Additionally, SCP-1547 always carries a candy stick with them, which they use to relieve stress or anxiety.

SCP-1547's personality is self-reflective and prone to daydreaming, which sometimes results in humorous moments of clumsiness or lack of situational awareness. However, it is noted that SCP-1547 is incredibly perceptive and aware of their surroundings, and can quickly identify any potential threats. As a result, they have been recruited as a Security Guard within the facility, working in close cooperation with human Security Officers.

SCP-1547's candy stick has been found to have a calming effect on them, causing them to become less agitated and more focused on the task at hand. Due to this, SCP-1547 has requested to have a lifetime supply of candy sticks with them at all times, and this request has been granted. This item is considered to be essential to SCP-1547's well-being and should be provided to them at all times.

SCP-1547's Origins and Containment: The origin of SCP-1547 is currently unknown, and attempts to trace their origins have been unsuccessful. The Foundation acquired SCP-1547 through unknown means on [REDACTED], and they have been in containment under the Special Containment Procedures since then. Due to their cooperative behavior and lack of violent tendencies, SCP-1547 has been assigned to work within the facility's security department, proving to be an invaluable asset in this capacity. SCP-1547's containment procedures are considered routine and do not require any extraordinary measures. However, it is advised that personnel refrain from teasing or play fighting with SCP-1547 to avoid any accidents or misunderstandings.

Addendum: SCP-1547 has shown remarkable loyalty and bravery in the line of duty, risking their life on multiple occasions to protect the facility. As such, they have been granted a commendation for their services to the Foundation. It is noted that SCP-1547's behavior inspires morale among the other personnel, making them a valuable asset beyond their security duties alone.
