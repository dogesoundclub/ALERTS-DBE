SCP-9075 or commonly known as "The Joker" is a human male in their late 30s who works at a car dealership as a salesperson. Upon initial observation, SCP-9075 is noted to have an anomalous appearance with facial features that are nothing short of bizarre. SCP-9075 possesses a small black spot around the right corner of their mouth, which appears to be in the shape of a warped smile. The right side of SCP-9075's mouth is always slightly downturned in a frightened expression, while their eyes are unnaturally bright red and appear to be clown-like in nature.

Another unique feature noted on SCP-9075 is a two-color band on their forehead, which turns neon green when they experience heightened emotions. SCP-9075 often wears a gold earring in their left ear, which seems to serve no particular purpose in regards to the anomaly.

SCP-9075's personality is best described as impulsive, reckless, and desperate for attention. They tend to act without taking proper precautions, which often leads them into trouble. SCP-9075 is often found trying to impress or make jokes, leading to minor accidents and mishaps, which only fuel their desire for attention.

Although SCP-9075's anomalous characteristics pose no immediate threat, there is a possibility of their behavior escalating if left unchecked. Further observation and monitoring are recommended to assess any potential danger.
