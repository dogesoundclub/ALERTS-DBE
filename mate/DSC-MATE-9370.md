Item #: 9370

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9370 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any and all visitors must wear level B hazmat suits due to subject's unusual eye color and the use of a gas mask as a frequent accessory. All communications with Subject 9370 must be monitored and approved by Level 4 personnel.

Description: Subject 9370, known outside of containment as a banker, is a middle-aged human male standing at approximately six feet tall. He wears a short peak cap on his head, a gold earring on his left ear, and a gold chain around his neck. The most striking feature of his appearance is his bright blue clown eyes, which display a perpetual smile.

Subject 9370 appears to have a traditional mindset and values, and may appear stern or no-nonsense in his demeanor. However, he also displays a playful and humorous personality, often telling jokes or passing down stories from his family or community. This personality has been known to lure unsuspecting individuals into revealing personal information during financial transactions.

It is unknown how or why Subject 9370 acquired his anomalous properties, but it is suspected that he may be tied to a cultural group that practices reality-bending rituals. Further investigation is necessary, as Subject 9370's abilities may pose a potential threat to financial stability if left unchecked. 

Addendum: In light of recent events, it has been discovered that Subject 9370 possesses the ability to alter reality through the use of verbal negotiations during financial transactions. It is imperative that his containment continued and that further research be conducted to understand the limits of his abilities.
