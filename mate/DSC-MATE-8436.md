Its external appearance is unremarkable, its internal mechanisms have proven to be nearly indestructible. 

Personality: DSC 8436 has a strong sense of independence and is often resistant to authority. It views rules and regulations as limiting, and may resort to rebellious behavior in defiance of them.

Caution is advised when interacting with DSC 8436 as it has demonstrated a contemptuous attitude towards those it perceives as inferior or weak. 

Containment Procedures: DSC 8436 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber 3 meters by 3 meters in size. The walls of the chamber are to be reinforced to withstand high levels of impact.

DSC 8436 is to be monitored at all times through standard surveillance equipment, as it has been observed attempting to hack into Foundation computer systems on several occasions. Any unauthorized activity is to be reported immediately to the Site Director.

All personnel interacting with DSC 8436 must have Level 4 clearance and are required to wear protective gear. A remote-controlled electro-magnetic pulse generator must be kept on standby in case of any attempts by DSC 8436 to escape.

Under no circumstances are staff to engage in any form of communication or negotiation with DSC 8436, as it has demonstrated a ruthless and cunning nature in its capacity as a mafia boss. 

DSC 8436 is to be fed standard robotic nutritional supplements every 72 hours, and all maintenance procedures are to be carried out by a minimum of two qualified Foundation technicians.

Failure to comply with these measures may result in serious injury or death to Foundation personnel or innocent civilians, due to DSC 8436's unpredictable and dangerous nature.
