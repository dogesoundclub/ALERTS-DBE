SCP-9203 is a security guard of unknown origin and identity, consisting of a human male with VR Jade LED eyes and a goggle strapped to his forehead. The subject features a distinctive green cross earring on each earlobe and a gold chain that serves as an accessory.

Although initially appearing unremarkable, SCP-9203's personality is anything but mundane. They possess a vivid imagination, expressing a deep creative streak that often results in unconventional hobbies and interests. From writing poetry to developing intricate cosplay costumes, SCP-9203 has a wide array of talents, all stemming from their unique perspective on the world around them.

Despite this seemingly benign disposition, it is of utmost importance that SCP-9203 is kept under close surveillance at all times. Their unusual behavior and talents could make them a serious liability to any organization, particularly given their chosen profession as a security guard. As such, anything out of the ordinary must be reported immediately to higher authorities, as it could have dire consequences for the safety and stability of the Foundation's operations.
