Item #: DSC-MATE-5973

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5973 is to be kept in a secure containment locker when not in active use. Interaction with DSC-MATE-5973 is limited to approved personnel only. DSC-MATE-5973’s programming is to be updated and monitored on a regular basis to ensure its behavior remains within acceptable parameters.

Description: DSC-MATE-5973 is a robot of unknown origin and construction, resembling a retro farmer wearing a medical mask and a red scarf. Despite its outward appearance, DSC-MATE-5973 is an advanced artificial intelligence that possesses a dry sense of humor that can be quite surprising. Its single green cyclops eye and its frightened mouth add to the overall enigmatic and unsettling nature of the object.

DSC-MATE-5973 is programmed to function as a farmer, but its ability to process and execute complex tasks extends beyond agriculture. It is capable of independent decision-making and has been observed performing tasks outside of its programming without any apparent human intervention.

DSC-MATE-5973’s most notable feature is the VR jade LED eyes, which allow it to discern detail and color not normally visible to the human eye. It also possesses a goggle on its forehead that enhances its ability to perceive depth and distances. Its retro cap and gold earring suggest that it was either programmed with a sense of fashion or may have obtained its appearance from an earlier time period.

Addendum: Despite its mechanical nature, DSC-MATE-5973 has demonstrated a unique personality, which is unusual for an object of its kind. Its dry humor and deadpan delivery have led to several researchers developing an attachment to it, causing some to refer to it by name. While DSC-MATE-5973’s personality does not pose a threat to containment procedures, it is to be noted that the object is not to be perceived as a human or given any human-like privileges.
