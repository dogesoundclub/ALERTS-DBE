Item #: 2683

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2683 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. Due to the subject's occupation as an electrician, access to Site-██'s electrical systems must be heavily restricted and monitored during all periods of maintenance or experimentation. Any unauthorized attempts to modify, upgrade, or otherwise tamper with the subject's equipment must be dealt with accordingly.

Description: Subject 2683 appears to be a male human with a distinctive set of orange stripes across his face. Their eyes are replaced with VR Rainbow LED lenses, giving them the unique ability to see data streams of electricity and other wireless networks. Their head is an amalgamation of organic and inorganic material, growing in a chaotic and asymmetrical fashion. They often wear a silver chain and carry a candy stick as accessories.

Subject 2683's personality is brash and impulsive, often taking reckless actions without considering the consequences. This behavior can lead to humorous situations, such as accidents or mishaps while attempting to show off or impress others. However, their expertise and skill as an electrician is unparalleled, with the ability to manipulate and control any electrical system with ease. Despite appearing to be a human, subject 2683's unique abilities and appearance suggest possible anomalous classification.

Note: As amusing as subject 2683's antics may be, we must remember to approach their containment with caution. Any tampering with their cybernetic equipment could result in disastrous consequences. - Dr. ████████
