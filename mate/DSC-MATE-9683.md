Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9683 is to be assigned to a Foundation-approved occupation as a journalist or reporter to ensure their compliance with the Veil Protocol. Subject 9683's movements and communications are to be monitored at all times. Any anomalous or suspicious activity must be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately.

Description: Subject 9683 appears to be a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. Their most notable physical characteristics include a spot on their mouth and red clown eyes, which have been surgically implanted. Subject 9683 prefers to wear a hoodie and accessorizes with a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

Subject 9683 has a deep curiosity about the world and often enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. This trait has been known to cause some humorous situations, as they will spontaneously share obscure facts or trivia with others. However, this curiosity may also lead to dangerous situations, as Subject 9683 has been known to investigate anomalous events without proper clearance.

Although Subject 9683 is not known to possess any anomalous abilities, their fascination with the paranormal and unexplained phenomena make them a potential liability to the Foundation. Therefore, it is imperative that their movements are closely monitored to prevent any potential breaches of the Veil Protocol.

Addendum: Subject 9683 recently expressed interest in investigating a series of disappearances in a nearby urban area. Following this investigation, Subject 9683 has been placed on probation and will be closely monitored for the foreseeable future.
