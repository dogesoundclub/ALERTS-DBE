Description: SCP-5648 is a car salesman of human origin. SCP-5648's facial features are characterized by orange stripes, which are of unknown origin, and a permanent smile. SCP-5648's eyes are covered by a pair of normal glasses, and SCP-5648 often wears a hoodie with a red scarf as an accessory. SCP-5648's mouth is covered by a medical mask, although its purpose of wearing is unclear.

SCP-5648's personality is described as analytical and logical, with a quirky sense of humor. SCP-5648 enjoys making witty observations and teasing friends in a dry, deadpan way. However, it has been observed that SCP-5648 becomes easily agitated when discussing the topic of cars.

SCP-5648's anomalous properties were discovered after a series of infection outbreaks occurred in the car dealership where SCP-5648 was employed. The source of the outbreak was traced to SCP-5648's orange-striped facial features, which had transmitted an unknown infectious agent to customers.

Further research into SCP-5648's abilities is ongoing, and as such, SCP-5648 is currently classified as Safe.
