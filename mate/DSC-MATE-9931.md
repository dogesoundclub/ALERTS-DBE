Item #: 9931

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9931 is currently employed as a programmer in a tech company in the city. Due to the nature of his job, he is allowed free movement within the city. However, he must check in with the Foundation every week for evaluation of his mental and physical state.

Description: Subject 9931 is a human male identified as a programmer. He is known to have a habit of acting recklessly without thinking of the consequences beforehand. His unconventional fashion sense is characterized by a metallic purple headpiece, gold earring, and ski-goggle eyes along with a medical mask that covers his mouth. He is often seen wearing a vibrant red scarf that spills over his shirt collar.

Personality: Subject 9931 is known to be humorous and lighthearted. With his tendency to show off, his actions can lead to minor accidents and mishaps that are seen as endearing. However, he must be monitored closely to ensure that his actions do not lead to harm to others or reveal the existence of the Foundation.

Notes: Subject 9931's reckless behavior should not be taken lightly. Despite his humorous persona, his actions have the potential to cause a major breach of containment protocols. While his harmless and playful demeanor is a good distraction, we must keep a cautious eye on him at all times.
