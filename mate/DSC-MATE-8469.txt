Item #: SCP-8469

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8469 is to be placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their tendency to act recklessly, all potentially hazardous objects and tools are to be kept out of their reach.

Description: SCP-8469 is a 35-year-old male human, approximately 5'10" tall. They are a skilled mechanic, known to tinker with various machines and gadgets. SCP-8469 has a unique spot on their upper lip, resembling a birthmark or freckle, which has earned them the nickname "Mouth Spot." They typically wear a blue bandana on their head, and a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-8469 has a bright and cheerful personality, often wearing a smile on their face. They tend to act impulsively and prefer to show off their skills to impress others, which has led to various minor accidents and mishaps. SCP-8469 often wears normal glasses to correct their vision and a jade earring in one ear as an additional accessory.

SCP-8469 is known to wear a gas mask on occasion, though the reason for this is unknown at this time. Further investigation may be required to determine whether this behavior is a result of their recklessness or a symptom of a larger issue.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8469's mechanic skills, the Foundation may be able to utilize their abilities in the maintenance and repair of various Foundation equipment, though this is to be monitored closely. SCP-8469 has expressed interest in working with SCP objects and has the potential to be a valuable asset in containment procedures. However, caution must be exercised to prevent any further harm to SCP-8469 or other personnel.
