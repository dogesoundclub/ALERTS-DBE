Item #: SCP-723

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-723 is to be contained within Site-███'s Employee Break Room. All staff members encountering SCP-723 are to treat it as a normal human subject in order to prevent exposure of the anomaly to the general public. Any conversations with SCP-723 are to be monitored and recorded for further analysis.

Description: SCP-723 is a human male, approximately 25 years of age, employed as a fast food worker at the ████ McDonald’s restaurant chain. The subject's face features include orange stripes and a perpetually positive smile, and the subject's eyes display a VR Rainbow LED effect. SCP-723 often wears a short peak cap, a gold earring, a red scarf, and carries a candy stick.

SCP-723's anomalous properties manifest in the form of an ability to connect with others on a deep level. Subjects are often willing to divulge personal information and open up to SCP-723 in ways that they would not with other individuals. SCP-723's charisma and infectious positive attitude have led to a variety of humorous situations involving the unveiling of unexpected personal stories or sharing funny anecdotes that bring individuals closer together.

Addendum: SCP-723 has been a valuable asset in several Foundation interrogations by gaining valuable information in a disarming and non-threatening manner. SCP-723's interview abilities were thoroughly vetted and the anomaly was approved for limited field use. SCP-723 is not to be employed in long-term or field missions due to the risk of exposure of the Foundation and anomaly.
