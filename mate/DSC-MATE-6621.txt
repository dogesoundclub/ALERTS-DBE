Item #: SCP-6621

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6621 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-███. SCP-6621 is permitted to perform its job as a beautician on staff members, but must be monitored during gift-giving holidays to prevent any anomalous activity. SCP-6621 may request specific materials for their beautician work, which will be provided pending approval from a Level 3 or higher personnel.

Description: SCP-6621 is a male human with blonde hair, normal glasses, and a distinctive mouth spot. SCP-6621 has an additional mouth feature, which appears to be a frightened or anxious expression that is always present, even when SCP-6621 is smiling. SCP-6621 also has a green cross earring on one ear and is often seen wearing a silver chain and carrying a candy stick.

SCP-6621's primary anomalous property is its exceptional ability to observe and attend to details, making SCP-6621 a highly skilled beautician. SCP-6621 is capable of reading nonverbal cues and body language to gain insight into clients' wishes and needs.

However, SCP-6621's perfectionism can lead to obsessive and potentially harmful behavior during gift-giving occasions. SCP-6621 can spend excessive amounts of time agonizing over the "perfect" gift for individuals, potentially leading to an increased risk of stalking or other intrusive activities.

SCP-6621 has shown no signs of aggressive behavior towards staff or outside individuals and has cooperated fully with Foundation personnel. SCP-6621 is aware of its anomalous properties and has agreed to comply with all containment procedures.
