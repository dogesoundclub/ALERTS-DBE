Item #: DSC-MATE-4592

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4592 is to be monitored by at least two agents at all times. Due to the subject's public profile and political influence, any unusual behavior or potential risks should be promptly reported to the Foundation's Command and Control Center. In addition, DSC-MATE-4592's residence and workplace are to be checked daily for any anomalous objects or entities.

Description: DSC-MATE-4592 is a humanoid entity resembling a human female of approximately 35 years of age. The subject's most noticeable feature is the purple color of her lips, which appears to be a natural pigmentation variant. However, DSC-MATE-4592's eyes are more anomalous, as they emit a continuous spectrum of colors, resembling a virtual reality headset. Despite the odd appearance, DSC-MATE-4592's eyes seem to function normally, and the subject has demonstrated no apparent ill effects from this condition.

DSC-MATE-4592 often wears a silver chain around her neck, which appears to be a simple fashion accessory. However, the chain may have some sentimental or magical value to the subject, as she rarely removes it and becomes visibly agitated when someone touches or breaks it without her permission.

DSC-MATE-4592 is a skilled politician, having been elected to various offices at the local, state, and national levels. Although DSC-MATE-4592's public speeches and interviews suggest a confident and charismatic personality, deeper analysis has revealed some neurotic tendencies, particularly related to gift-giving. DSC-MATE-4592 is extremely observant and attentive to details, often using this skill to impress or manipulate others. However, DSC-MATE-4592 may also obsess over finding the perfect gift for someone, leading to procrastination, anxiety, and even depression. DSC-MATE-4592 has shown some resistance to psychiatric interventions, claiming that her gift-giving habits are essential for maintaining social harmony and balance.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-4592 was suspected to have been involved in an anomalous event in ████████, where several people reported seeing rainbow-colored lights and hearing strange voices. Although DSC-MATE-4592 denied any involvement and provided an alibi, further investigation revealed that the subject had been in contact with a known group of occultists via encrypted channels. Upon being questioned, DSC-MATE-4592 admitted to trading information and favors with the group but claimed that she did not participate in any rituals or summonings. The Foundation is currently monitoring DSC-MATE-4592's connections and activities in relation to anomalous entities and groups.
