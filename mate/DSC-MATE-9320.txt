Item #: SCP-9320

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9320 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times when not out on delivery missions. SCP-9320 is not to be left alone with any other humanoids, especially those smaller in size. SCP-9320 is to be fed a diet consisting primarily of meat.

Description: SCP-9320 is a male tiger with a distinctive bucket hat that it refuses to remove. SCP-9320 exhibits a frightened mouth and wears nerd glasses, combined with a gold earring, giving it a peculiar and somewhat eccentric appearance. SCP-9320 also wears an LED gas mask as an accessory, despite it not providing any sort of benefit or function to the subject.

SCP-9320, in addition to its appearance, has a strong and decisive personality, often appearing bossy and intimidating towards others. This behavior is believed to be a result of being a delivery driver, always needing to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. While SCP-9320 appears to be of a high intelligence level, it is unknown how much of this is attributed to its species, or if it is a result of its anomalous properties.

SCP-9320 has the ability to communicate verbally in multiple languages, which it claims is a result of being a delivery driver for a popular international company. However, SCP-9320 has not provided any authentic documentation, and therefore this claim remains unverified.

SCP-9320's anomalous properties manifest when it is left alone with a humanoid subject smaller in size, regardless of age or gender. Upon being left alone, SCP-9320 will begin to exhibit aggressive tendencies, often ending in the subject being severely injured or killed.

Addendum: SCP-9320 is proving to be a difficult subject to study due to its aggressive tendencies, and as such, further research and containment procedures are ongoing.
