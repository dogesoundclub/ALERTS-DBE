Item #: SCP-7689

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7689 is to be kept under strict observation at all times. Any attempt to communicate with SCP-7689 should be done remotely via audio or video recording. Under no circumstances should anyone approach SCP-7689 in person.

Description: SCP-7689 is a human male with distinct facial features. His face bears several spots, and his mouth is shaped like that of a clown. SCP-7689's eyes are a bright red color, reminiscent of clown makeup. SCP-7689 wears a blue bandana on his head and a green cross earring on his left ear. He also sports a silver chain around his neck and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7689 is a politician with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. However, this often leads to him taking on more than he can handle, resulting in humorous situations. For example, he may try to fit too many tasks into a single day or carry too many things at once.

It is unknown how SCP-7689 acquired his anomalous traits or how they affect his political career. However, the Foundation suspects that SCP-7689 poses a significant risk to the public due to his abnormal appearance and behavior.

Addendum: SCP-7689 was taken into Foundation custody after reports of several individuals witnessing him using anomalous abilities to manipulate voters in his favor. Further investigation is necessary to determine the extent of SCP-7689's anomalous capabilities.
