Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8194 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with basic amenities as per Foundation protocols.

Description: SCP-8194 is a male rabbit measuring approximately 1.2 meters in height. It is outfitted with a blue bandana and a pair of nerdy glasses, giving it an intellectual appearance. SCP-8194 also sports a gold earring and is frequently seen with a cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-8194 is known to possess a highly analytical and logical mindset, and it takes pleasure in engaging in debates or arguments with others, often over trivial or insignificant matters. SCP-8194 is capable of manipulating semantics and utilizing logical fallacies with great ease, making it a formidable opponent in any intellectual confrontation.

SCP-8194's anomalous effect manifests when it engages in a debate or philosophical argument with a human subject. Subjects who engage with SCP-8194 for extended periods of time exhibit a noticeable increase in logical and analytical skills, but also demonstrate a tendency to engage in unproductive arguments with others. Additionally, subjects may gradually develop a personality similar to SCP-8194's, displaying heightened logical reasoning and a love for intellectual sparring.

Any personnel who engage in debates with SCP-8194 are to be monitored for changes in personality and reasoning skills.
