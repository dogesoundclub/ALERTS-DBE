SCP Identification Number 293, also known as "The Jester Doctor", is a monkey that stands at approximately 3 feet tall. One of the most striking features of this creature is its red clown eyes that seem to glint eerily in low light conditions. Its frightened mouth is always opened, as if pleading for something to come save it. 

SCP-293 has a unique fashion sense - its head is always covered by a hoodie that hides any defining features of its face. The creature also sports a red scarf that seems to be its favorite accessory. More often than not, you can observe a lit cigarette in its hand, which it uses to blow smoky rings as it delivers its characteristic jokes.

However, don't let its harmless appearance fool you - SCP-293 is not your typical primate. It possesses a dry sense of humor that is often unexpected, even for paranormal creatures. Its deadpan jokes have been known to leave humans and other SCPs alike astonished at the unexpected delivery. 

Even more intriguing is its role as a doctor. Despite its rather unorthodox appearance and behavior, SCP-293 is an exceptional medical practitioner, with an attention to detail that borders on obsessive. Its medical knowledge spans across species, making it one of the most sought-after doctors in the Foundation. However, it's always better to let this SCP call the shots - cross it and you'll end up being the butt of its next joke.
