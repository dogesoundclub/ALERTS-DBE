Item #: DSC-MATE-7781

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7781 is currently contained at Site-██ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. DSC-MATE-7781 is allowed to continue her job as a train driver, but is accompanied by two Foundation agents at all times during her shifts. No one is allowed to board the train unless they have been thoroughly searched and screened beforehand.

Description: DSC-MATE-7781 is a female human with spots on her face, a smile, and a head resembling that of a 00s school girl. She wears a silver chain and a red cross earring in her ears, and has a medical mask covering her mouth. She also wears goggles on her forehead. Despite her unusual appearance, she appears to be a regular person in terms of physical capabilities.

DSC-MATE-7781’s most notable feature is her personality. She is incredibly organized, efficient, and sometimes controlling, often taking charge of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. She tends to show signs of OCD, often cleaning her immediate surroundings and checking and rechecking her work. DSC-MATE-7781 is also a train driver and is known for her punctuality and adherence to schedules.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7781 has displayed no anomalous behavior or abilities, and initial testing has returned negative results. However, due to her position as a train driver and her tendency to be controlling, the Foundation has deemed it necessary to keep her under surveillance to ensure the safety of civilians. DSC-MATE-7781 has cooperated fully with Foundation agents and has shown no signs of suspicion or hostility towards them. Further testing and observation may be conducted if necessary.
