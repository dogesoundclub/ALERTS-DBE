Item#: 5162

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5162, also known as "The Firefighter," is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber's walls should be reinforced with fire-resistant materials and equipped with a fire suppression system.

Description: Item 5162 appears to be a human female in her early thirties, with vibrant orange stripes crisscrossing her face and a bright red lip. Her eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and her head is that of a pink rabbit. A pair of goggles are consistently worn on her forehead, and she is often seen wearing a black choker.

The Firefighter works as a firefighter in the local fire department and has demonstrated exceptional bravery and skill, even in the most perilous fires. Despite the physical limitations of being a hybrid creature, Item 5162 shows remarkable agility, strength, and endurance; able to enter burning buildings with ease and emerge unscathed.

Personality: The Firefighter is fiercely independent, determined to never ask for help even when needed. This often results in her getting caught in amusing predicaments such as attempting to move heavy objects or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost.

Item 5162 has shown no sign of hostility or any anomalous behavior outside of her physical appearance. She has been cooperative and friendly with Foundation personnel, often lending her expertise in fire suppression during fire suppression unit drills. 

Addendum: Item 5162's anomalous properties have yet to be fully determined. Further testing is required to understand why she possesses a rabbit's head and orange stripes, and how these factors influence her fire suppression skills.
