Item #: SCP-1417

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1417 is to be monitored at all times while they are on duty as a delivery driver. Any irregular behavior or activity is to be reported immediately to Site-19. SCP-1417 is to be provided with a set of standard delivery equipment and assigned to low-risk areas. Any requests for SCP-1417 to deliver an item outside of their assigned area must be approved by at least one Level-3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1417 is a human male with sporadic spots on their face and a constant smile. SCP-1417's eyes are replaced with VR Jade LED screens, suggesting an implant or prosthetic. SCP-1417 is also known for wearing a blue bandana around their head and a pair of goggles on their forehead. Their ears are adorned with a green cross earring, and they are often seen wearing a silver chain.

SCP-1417 displays a highly introspective personality, often getting lost in their thoughts or daydreaming. This can lead to humorous situations, such as walking into a pole or tripping over objects. SCP-1417's introspective personality suggests that their mind may be susceptible to outside intrusion or manipulation.

SCP-1417's delivery job makes them an ideal candidate for transporting anomalous objects. However, their easily distracted personality presents a risk for containment breaches. SCP-1417 should only be assigned to deliver low-risk items, with high-risk items being entrusted to more stable personnel.

Addendum 1417-A: SCP-1417's Jade LED screens have been examined and found to have an unknown but highly advanced technology. Examination of SCP-1417's cranial implant has been denied by SCP-1417 themselves, citing personal reasons. Further research into these implants is ongoing.
