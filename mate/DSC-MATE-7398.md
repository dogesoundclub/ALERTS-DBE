Description: Item 7398 is a male human of average height and build. Their most notable features are the peculiar mouth spot and clown mouth. The mouth spot is a red marking on their upper lip that appears to resemble a clown's nose. Their clown mouth, on the other hand, is a permanent red smiley face that stretches across their cheeks.

The item's eyes are dark blue and have a strange, almost hypnotic quality to them, causing those who gaze into them to feel a sense of unease. The item usually wears a black hoodie with a red victory band on the forehead, a red scarf, and carries a candy stick with them at all times.

Personality: Item 7398 is known for their strong and decisive personality. They have a no-nonsense approach to their work and interactions with others, which can often come across as bossy or intimidating. They are highly efficient, quick-witted, and goal-oriented, with a keen eye for details.

Reports from those who have interacted with item 7398 suggest that they have a strange and inexplicable affinity for all things clown-related. This fascination with clowns is said to be an integral part of their work as a fashion designer, with many of their designs heavily featuring clown-like motifs and aesthetics.

Despite their intimidating persona, item 7398 is generally regarded as dedicated to their craft and highly respected within their field. However, given their unusual appearance and behavior, the Foundation considers them a potential security risk and a danger to the public.
