Item #: 9635

Species Designation: Primateus sapiens

Occupation: Theater Manager

Physical Description: 

SCP-9635 appears to be a humanoid figure, with the physical features and characteristics of an adult male monkey. While the specimen's fur is limited to certain body parts, its skin is notably thicker and rougher than that of a human being. SCP-9635's face is largely human-like with the exception of elongated eye sockets that require specially fitted glasses. The mouth is often in a frightened state with a tendency to exhibit noticeable shaking.

In addition, SCP-9635 commonly wears a gold chain and a candy stick as accessories.

Personality and Behavior:

SCP-9635 is a relatively forgetful individual, with a high tendency to lose track of time and upcoming events. This forgetfulness can lead to unintentional comedic situations, with the specimen regularly missing appointments and losing track of important tasks. SCP-9635 is otherwise cooperative and exhibits no signs of aggression.

Containment Procedures:

SCP-9635 is currently contained in a standard humanoid cell and requires no additional restraints outside of normal containment procedures. Access to communication devices, such as a cell phone, is permitted but attentively monitored.

Interactions with SCP-9635 should be kept brief and limited to follow-up discussions related to employment or assigned tasks. Any deviations from SCP-9635's usual behavior should be reported to the assigned handler immediately.
