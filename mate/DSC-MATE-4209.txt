Item #: SCP-4209

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4209 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As a primate, SCP-4209 has been provided with appropriate furnishings and enrichment toys. Any requests for additional items must be submitted to the senior researcher on duty for approval.

SCP-4209 is to consume a daily dose of Class-B amnestics in their meals to prevent them from revealing the existence of the Foundation or any anomalous entities.

Description: SCP-4209 is a male primate of the species known as a monkey. They have black hair atop their head and a jade earring in their left ear. Their eyes are red with an abnormal shape, reminiscent of clown makeup. SCP-4209 displays a persistent frightened mouth, as if in a state of constant terror.

Despite their anxiety, SCP-4209 is an extremely creative individual, frequently conjuring up new and unique ideas. Their mind wanders often, and they love to brainstorm solutions to problems, even if their ideas can be outlandish or absurd.

SCP-4209 wears a gold chain around their neck, and they always carry a candy stick in their pocket.

SCP-4209 was discovered working as a banker in downtown ████████. It is unknown how they obtained this position or how they have managed to keep their anomalous traits hidden for so long.

Addendum: During a routine check of SCP-4209's personal items, agents discovered a note in their handwriting. The note detailed a plan to rob the bank where SCP-4209 worked. When questioned about this, SCP-4209 claimed they were "just brainstorming" and had no intention of following through with the scheme. Further investigation is warranted.
