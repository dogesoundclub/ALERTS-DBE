Appearance:

Subject 8359 is a peculiar sight to behold. The most prominent feature is the spots on their face. These spots are in stark contrast to the rest of their pale skin. Their lips are constantly covered with a medical mask, despite the lack of a visible disease. The subject wears a short peak cap atop their head, giving them a clean appearance.

They have a remarkable ability to connect with others on a deep level, leading to humorous situations where strangers, unable to resist their charm, reveal their life stories to the subject.

Furthermore, any attempt by the subject to communicate with any personnel, either audio or otherwise, must be reported to supervising personnel immediately. 

In conclusion:
