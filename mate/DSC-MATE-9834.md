Item #: 9834

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9834 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with adequate provisions for feeding, grooming, and enrichment. It is to be provided with a variety of hair care products, including shampoos and conditioners, as well as beauty tools such as scissors, combs, and hairdryers. Access to a variety of fashion magazines and other beauty-related publications may also be provided at the discretion of the overseeing researcher. Subject 9834 is to be monitored at all times for signs of distress or self-harm.

Description: Subject 9834 is a male monkey approximately 2 feet in height, with a distinctive blue bandana tied around its head and a jade earring in its left ear. It wears a pair of horned rim glasses which it appears to use for seeing fine details. It has a frightened expression, with its mouth slightly open as if anticipating danger.

Subject 9834 has a kind and empathetic personality, and it often appears to be a natural caretaker. It is highly skilled in the art of grooming and styling hair, and it takes great pride in its work. However, it is also prone to taking on the emotional burdens of others, and may become overly invested in solving the problems of those around it. This can lead to burnout and emotional exhaustion if left unchecked.

Addendum: Subject 9834 was recovered from a beauty salon in downtown [REDACTED], where it had been working as a professional beautician. It was discovered by local authorities after reports of a "talking monkey" in the salon caused a disturbance. Subject 9834 was cooperative during capture and relocation to Foundation custody. It has not displayed any anomalous abilities beyond its remarkable hairdressing skills. Further study is ongoing.
