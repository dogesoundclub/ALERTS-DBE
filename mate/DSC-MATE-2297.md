Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2297, aka "The Clown Boss," is to be kept under constant surveillance in a maximum security facility. Personnel are warned not to engage in any debate or argument with subject as it may lead to unintended consequences. Any attempt to introduce any candy or sweets into the containment area is strictly prohibited.

Description: Subject 2297 is a male human who exhibits orange stripes on his face and a clown mouth. His eyes are red and resemble circus clown eyes. His head is not arranged green and has a goggle on the forehead. He wears a green cross earring and a silver chain around his neck. He is often seen carrying a candy stick as an accessory.

Subject 2297 is the head of a powerful Mafia organization, and his analytical and logical mind makes him an excellent strategist. He enjoys debating and arguing with others, often over trivial or unimportant subjects, and has a fondness for candy and sweets. Personnel are warned against engaging in any discussion with the subject, as it may lead to unexpected outcomes.

Addendum: It has been observed that subject 2297's candy stick has an anomalous effect on those who consume it. The candy apparently induces lethargy and makes the consumer highly susceptible to suggestion. Further study is required to determine the nature and extent of this effect. As a precaution, any candy or sweet items are to be confiscated and kept away from subject 2297 at all times.
