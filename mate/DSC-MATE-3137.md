DSC-MATE-3137's eyes are red with black pupils, resembling those of a clown, and its mouth is often seen in a frightened expression.

DSC-MATE-3137 is a fashion designer, known for its ambitious and goal-oriented nature. It often takes on more than it can handle, but due to its strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills, it usually manages to pull it off. DSC-MATE-3137 has a fear of failure, often resulting in it being overly cautious and taking additional measures to ensure its designs are flawless.

DSC-MATE-3137 is also equipped with a whistle, which it uses to communicate with its assistants, who are unseen by personnel. The whistle emits an unknown frequency, which causes its assistants to appear, complete the required task, and then disappear.

DSC-MATE-3137 has been very cooperative with Foundation personnel, but it must be reminded that it is not to interact with any other DSCs or personnel without proper authorization.
