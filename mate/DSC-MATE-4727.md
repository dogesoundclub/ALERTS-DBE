Item #: 4727

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 4727 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. The chamber must be furnished with basic amenities and work-related tools. Under no circumstance should 4727 be provided with any sharp objects or firearms, unless it is for occupational purposes.

Description: 4727 is a male human farmer with some unusual features. His head is entirely made of an unknown metal alloy that emits a mildly purple glow. His eyes resemble skiing goggles, with amber lenses that obscure his actual eyesight. Instead, 4727 has been observed feeling around and echoing his surroundings, which may indicate some degree of blindness. Also, a jade earring adorns each of his ears.

The subject is frequently observed bite his bottom lip nervously, showing a frightened expression when faced with unfamiliar situations. Despite his anxiety, 4727 is friendly and cooperative, often engaging in conversation with researchers and asking questions about the outside world.

4727 is a peculiar case of introversion, prone to daydreaming and even getting lost in thought. In some curious situations, he may walk into physical objects or trip over things while preoccupied, causing him to laugh it off when he comes back to his senses. Furthermore, 4727 tends to have a preference for isolation, avoiding large crowds whenever possible.

Additional Notes: The origin of the metal that makes up 4727's head remains under investigation. Researchers speculate that it could have been either an experimental procedure or an encounter with an anomalous entity. Nevertheless, 4727's tranquil personality and bizarre appearance do not seem to pose any direct danger to personnel or subjects. Except, of course, when there are poles or obstacles in his way.
