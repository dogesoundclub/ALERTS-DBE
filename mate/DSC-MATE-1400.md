Item #: 1400

Object Class: Euclid

Job: Reporter

Species: Tiger

Gender: Male

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of their species, 1400 must be kept in a specialized containment unit with ample space for movement, exercise, and various forms of enrichment. Proper care must be taken to provide a suitable diet consistent with their species.

Description: 1400 is a male tiger, standing at approximately 7ft in height and weighing in at 600lbs. They possess a unique blue bandana on their head, with a jade earring on each ear. Their normal glasses cover their dark, piercing eyes which display intelligence and cunning. A constant feature of their face is a frightened mouth, indicating that they are often uneasy or fearful.

The subject is observed to frequently wear a gold chain as an accessory, indicating a preference for prestige items. Despite their fierce appearance, 1400 exhibits a very nurturing and caring personality, displaying humorous situations by care giving to his family and friends as if they were his own children.

Due to this temperament, caution must be exercised when interacting with the subject, as he may become hostile if he perceives or senses his offspring or loved ones are in danger. However, if provided an appropriate environment and engaged with in a non-threatening manner, they can be very responsive and sociable.

Addendum: 1400 was discovered in a remote area of the Amazon rainforest, where it was believed he was raising twin cubs as a surrogate parent. The twins were relocated to a sanctuary for their safety, and 1400 was transported to a specialized containment unit for further study. Despite initial fear and aggression toward researchers, 1400 has since responded well to appropriate levels of socialization and stimulation.
