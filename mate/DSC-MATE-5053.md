Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5053 is to be monitored during all social interactions with non-foundation personnel. Any signs of excessive excitement or enthusiasm are to be mitigated by Foundation personnel to prevent breaches of secrecy or potential harm to humans. Subject is allowed designated hours to pursue fashion designing when not under Foundation observation.

Description: Subject 5053 is a human male fashion designer with a striking mouth spot which appears to resemble an oddly symmetrical beauty mark. The subject sports nerd glasses that obscure their eyes while a blue bandana adorns their head. A unique goggle rests comfortably on their forehead. The subject is never seen without the support of their jade earring on their ear. Subject 5053 has a cheerful demeanor and is always eager to share their passion for fashion design with others. They take pleasure in coordinating patterns and hues together to create striking designs.

Personality: Subject 5053 is an extremely energetic and enthusiastic person. They have a talent for getting others excited about their artistic vision, often leading to light-hearted situations. They possess an unabashed love for their work and enjoy experimenting with new techniques to further their skills. The subject's tendency to get carried away with their enthusiasm has caused them slight difficulties when others do not share their exuberance. Nevertheless, the subject remains optimistic and perseveres towards their goals.

Addendum: Subject 5053 remains dedicated to their craft despite the limitations placed upon them by the Foundation. Their creations enhance the wardrobes of several Foundation personnel, and we have noted a marked improvement in morale as a result. No negative attributes have been observed, but further research on this subject should be continued.
