SCP-4405, also known as "The Clown Politician", is a humanoid entity of the human species with distinctive orange stripes on her face. She possesses red clown eyes and sports green hair under a matching purple cap. SCP-4405 often wears goggles on her forehead and a silver chain as an accessory.

Despite her appearance, SCP-4405 is a cunning and charismatic politician, using her analytical and logical mind to influence others towards her goals. However, her quirky sense of humor can sometimes make her seem untrustworthy and unpredictable.

Subject's anomaly appears to be related to her ability to manipulate the emotions and perceptions of others, a trait commonly associated with certain types of clowns. SCP-4405 has shown complete control over her abilities, using them to gain favor and manipulate key individuals to her advantage.

Any attempts to contain or apprehend SCP-4405 must be done with extreme caution, as her abilities can quickly turn against those who oppose her. The current protocol for interaction with SCP-4405 involves keeping a safe distance and limiting verbal exchanges to prevent any unintended emotional manipulation.
