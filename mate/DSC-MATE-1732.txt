SCP Foundation File #1732: "The Traffic Monkey"

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1732 is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit, with a secure lock on the door. The unit must be cleaned and restocked daily, and any damaged or broken items must be replaced promptly. Personnel entering the unit must wear protective clothing and should not make direct eye contact with SCP-1732.

Description: SCP-1732 appears to be a monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, standing approximately 50 centimeters tall and weighing around 5 kilograms. SCP-1732 wears a pair of nerd glasses and has a goggle on its forehead. It also carries a whistle as its accessory. SCP-1732's eyes are unusually intelligent for a monkey, and it has demonstrated the ability to understand and mimic human language to a limited extent.

SCP-1732 is known for its charismatic personality and its ability to connect with others on a deep level. It has been observed getting strangers to open up and share personal stories, or engaging in humorous banter that brings people closer together. SCP-1732 is also trained as a traffic officer, and it takes its job very seriously, using its whistle to direct vehicles and pedestrians with great efficiency.

SCP-1732's intelligence and charisma make it a valuable asset for the Foundation's research into interspecies communication and training. However, personnel should exercise extreme caution around SCP-1732, as it has demonstrated unpredictable behavior and has been known to act out violently when provoked. Any interaction with SCP-1732 should be approached with caution, and only by trained personnel. As with all SCPs, the safety of the handling team and the public must be the first priority.
