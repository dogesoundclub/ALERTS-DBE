Item #: DSC-MATE-1669

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1669 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Due to the nature of her anomalous properties, DSC-MATE-1669 is to have no access to any banking or financial institutions while under Foundation custody. Any attempts at communication with outside sources regarding monetary transactions are to be intercepted and terminated immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-1669 is a female human of indeterminate age, approximately 30-40 years old. DSC-MATE-1669 exhibits several anomalous traits; most notably, her eyes have been replaced with Jade LED lenses which can display a variety of visual effects, including but not limited to, infrared imaging, magnification, and night vision.

Further observation reveals that DSC-MATE-1669 also possesses a strange skin condition characterized by a series of spots on her face, which is believed to be linked to her anomalous abilities. Her 90s brown hair, jade earring, and choker also appear to be imbued with anomalous properties, although further research is needed to determine the exact nature of these abilities.

DSC-MATE-1669's personality has been found to be highly observant and detail-oriented. This displays in her excellent gift-giving abilities, although her desire to provide perfect gifts has led to undue stress and anxiety. DSC-MATE-1669's bank job prior to Foundation custody seems to have been chosen due to her desire to maintain control over monetary transactions, possibly due to her anomalous attributes.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-1669's anomalous properties, it is recommended that she be kept under constant surveillance by qualified personnel. Any attempts at escape or unauthorized use of her anomalous abilities could have devastating consequences both for the Foundation and the general populace.
