Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-9662 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All contact with SCP-9662 is to be made through a secure video feed, and physical interaction requires Level 3 clearance.

Description:

SCP-9662 is a human male of average height and weight, with normal blonde hair and a distinct mouth spot on the left side of his upper lip. SCP-9662 wears a medical mask over his mouth at all times, which he claims is for health reasons although there is no evident sign of medical condition. SCP-9662 wears a red victory band on his forehead and a red scarf around his neck. He is often seen sporting a jade earring on his left ear.

SCP-9662 works as a fashion designer and owns a successful clothing line called "Obscure Facts." SCP-9662's curiosity is insatiable, and he is known to spend hours reading on obscure topics. His fascination with the unusual often leads to him randomly spouting off facts to others, sometimes with little context or warning.

SCP-9662 is known for his infectious smile and charming personality. Although he appears to be friendly and harmless, his vast knowledge and quirky behavior have led the Foundation to keep a close eye on him.

Personality:

SCP-9662 is a curious individual, always eager to learn something new. He is approachable and enjoys starting conversations with others, but his fixation on obscure topics often leads to awkward and seemingly random exchanges. Despite this, SCP-9662 remains lighthearted and humorous, constantly cracking jokes and making light of intense situations.

Addendum:

During a routine interview, SCP-9662 expressed interest in learning about SCP objects and creatures, but the Foundation has deemed this request unnecessary for containment purposes. SCP-9662 is to remain isolated and monitored at all times.
