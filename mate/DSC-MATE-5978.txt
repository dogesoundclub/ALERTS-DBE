Description: SCP-5978 is a human female in her mid-twenties who works as a delivery driver for a local restaurant. SCP-5978's distinguishing features include her red lipstick, red clown eyes, and blonde hair worn in an ushanka. She also wears a medical mask over her mouth to conceal further anomalies. SCP-5978's forehead is marked with a two-color band, and she wears a green cross earring on each ear.

SCP-5978 displays an outgoing and social personality, often enjoying being the center of attention. However, it should be noted that SCP-5978's humor sometimes triggers uncontrollable laughter in those around her, which can lead to a dangerous situation. SCP-5978's anomalous abilities are not fully understood and require further study.

Addendum: SCP-5978's anomalous abilities were initially discovered when a Foundation agent ordered food from the restaurant where SCP-5978 works. The agent reported that SCP-5978's presence caused the restaurant's patrons to erupt in fits of laughter, leading to chaos and confusion. Further investigation revealed that SCP-5978's humor was capable of producing an anomalous effect, causing uncontrollable laughter in those around her. SCP-5978 was then apprehended and transferred to the Foundation's custody.
