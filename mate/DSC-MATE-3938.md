Item #: DSC-MATE-3938

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3938 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. DSC-MATE-3938 is to be provided with a steady supply of carrots and other rabbit-friendly food items. Due to DSC-MATE-3938's occupation, it is to be allowed regular leave for work, with assigned Foundation personnel accompanying it at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-3938 appears to be an anthropomorphic rabbit, standing at approximately one meter in height. Its head is covered by a green hoodie, with a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-3938's anomalous properties manifest primarily through its personality, which is characterized by a unique sense of humor that tends to catch others off guard.

DSC-MATE-3938 often delivers deadpan jokes and comments that can be surprisingly funny. It does not consider itself the "life of the party," but has a way of making those around it laugh despite this fact. DSC-MATE-3938's humor appears to be a result of its anomalous nature, though the exact mechanisms behind this effect are not currently understood.

DSC-MATE-3938 serves as a firefighter at a local fire department, and is thought to have become an DSC after exposure to an unknown anomaly related to its line of work. Foundation personnel have noted that DSC-MATE-3938 appears to be a competent and dedicated worker, though its unusual ability to diffuse tense situations through humor has led to integration issues with non-Foundation personnel.

Note: In light of DSC-MATE-3938's unique ability, it may prove useful in the future for diplomatic and negotiation purposes, pending further research into the extent of its effects.
