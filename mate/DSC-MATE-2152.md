Item #: 2152

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2152 is to be allowed to carry out their daily routines as a car salesman without any interference from Foundation personnel. However, they are to be monitored closely to ensure they do not expose the existence of anomalous entities to the general public. Any erratic behavior from the subject should be immediately reported to the containment team.

Description: DSC-MATE-2152 is a humanoid entity resembling a female human of average height and build. Their facial appearance is marked by distinct orange stripes and a bright red lipstick, while normal glasses cover their eyes. They often wear a medical mask over their mouth and a green cross earring on their ears. DSC-MATE-2152 is frequently seen wearing a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-2152 behaves like any typical human, but their personality tends to be highly organized and focuses on planning. At the same time, they possess a unique unpredictable side that makes them highly spontaneous. This characteristic allows DSC-MATE-2152 to engage in impromptu adventures, organize last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit, or surprise their friends with unexpected actions.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2152's spontaneous personality has on several occasions inadvertently led to exposure of anomalous entities to the general public. The subject is, therefore, advised to minimize their impulsive actions whenever possible. The containment team is currently working on proactive measures to prevent a potential breach of secrecy.
