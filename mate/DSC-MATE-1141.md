Item #: 1141

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1141 is to be contained at all times in a secure, soundproof chamber. Upon interacting with the subject, all personnel are required to wear Level 3 protective gear and gas masks at all times.

Description: Subject 1141 is a female human with distinctive orange stripes on her face, complemented by a pair of purple lips and red clown eyes. She sports a head of 90s brown hair which she styles in a punk fashion. Her appearance is completed by a normal gas mask she wears at all times, making it impossible to identify her without it.

Despite her human nature, the subject presents several anomalous traits, making her a risk to the general populace. As the leader of a prominent and elusive Mafia organization, she exudes a commanding presence that intimidates both her subordinates and rival gangs.

Subject 1141 exhibits a robust sense of independence and self-sufficiency that borders on rebellion. She finds authority and rules that limit her freedom unacceptable and often disobeys or disregards them, causing several incidents in the past with the Foundation's agents.

Topics surrounding her upbringing and origins remain unclear, adding to the mystery and danger she poses.

In addition, when interacting with the subject, extreme caution should be exercised as she is known to be manipulative and may attempt to shift control, making her an unpredictable and dynamic entity among the Foundation's list of Euclid class subjects.
