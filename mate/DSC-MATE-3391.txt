Description: SCP-3391 is a humanoid of the female sex, who appears to be a car salesman by occupation. SCP-3391's facial features are unusual, with spots covering her face and a purple lip.

SCP-3391 also wears a green cross earring, choker, and smokes cigarettes constantly.

SCP-3391 exhibits a strong sense of independence and is resistant to authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This can lead to rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission. SCP-3391 also displays a remarkable talent for salesmanship, able to convince individuals into purchasing vehicles outside of their standard budget.

It is currently unknown how SCP-3391 obtained its unique features and abilities. The origin of SCP-3391 is still under investigation.

Addendum: SCP-3391's unpredictable behavior and unusual physical characteristics have caught the interest of many organizations outside of the Foundation, including the Global Occult Coalition and Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. All attempts to obtain SCP-3391 have been unsuccessful, with SCP-3391 able to evade capture with ease. Further investigation is currently being conducted to determine if SCP-3391 poses a threat to the Foundation and the general public.
