Item #: SCP-9379

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9379 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel. SCP-9379 is required to wear its shade glasses at all times, which are to be secured in place by a specialized restraint system. While not presenting on the air, SCP-9379 is to be held in a standard containment chamber and provided with basic amenities.

Description: SCP-9379 is a male monkey of unknown species, measuring approximately 40 cm in height and weighing 7.2 kg. Despite its non-human appearance, SCP-9379 is capable of speech and is often employed as a news anchor for local television broadcasts. SCP-9379 is remarkable for its frightened mouth expression, which is present at all times and appears to be unrelated to its current state of being.

SCP-9379's personality is characterized by a strong impulse for excitement and risk-taking. It is prone to sudden and often dangerous activity, including jumping off high cliffs into water or throwing objects at random. Foundation psychologists have hypothesized that this behavior may be related to SCP-9379's lack of inhibitory mechanisms, or the result of an unknown neurological condition.

SCP-9379's shade glasses are a critical component of its containment, as exposure to direct sunlight can provoke intense and unpredictable behavior. The glasses are to be fitted with special restraints and monitored at all times to ensure their continued use.

Addendum 9379-1: On ██/██/████, SCP-9379 breached its containment chamber and gained access to the Foundation's intranet, resulting in a temporary shutdown of major research and communication systems. Following the incident, SCP-9379 was sedated and placed on extended probationary status. It is currently being evaluated by senior analysts for potential reclassification or termination.
