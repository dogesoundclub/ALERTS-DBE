Item #: SCP-2172

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2172 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-2172 is granted only to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, and all interactions must be supervised by at least 2 security personnel.

Description: SCP-2172 appears to be a human female in her mid-30s, with distinctive orange stripes on her face and red lips. Her eyes are VR Rainbow LED, and her head is not arranged in a conventional manner, appearing to be in a disorganized state of hair growth. On her forehead, she wears a goggle that serves no apparent purpose, and she has green cross earrings on her ears.

SCP-2172 is known to don a gold chain and an LED gas mask as accessories. The purpose of these accessories is currently unknown. SCP-2172 has been identified as the manager of a theater, and her duties and responsibilities appear to be the focus of her existence.

SCP-2172 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which can sometimes lead her to take on more than she can handle, resulting in comical situations. She is unable to fit all of her tasks into a single day and often tries to carry too many things at once.

SCP-2172 displays no anomalous abilities, and her biological functions appear to be normal. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the purpose of her accessories and possible anomalous properties. Until then, SCP-2172 is to be kept under close observation.
