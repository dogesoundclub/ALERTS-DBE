Item #: SCP-4325

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4325 is to be contained within a secure humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Only personnel with level 3 clearance or higher are permitted to enter SCP-4325's chamber. Any requests made by SCP-4325 to leave the chamber must be approved by at least two level 4 personnel.

SCP-4325 is to be powered off and recharged for eight hours every night. Any maintenance or repairs should be done by qualified personnel in the presence of at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-4325 is a robotic police officer with a retro cap on his head and a green cyclops eye. He stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 70 kilograms. His body is made of a combination of metal alloys and plastic materials.

SCP-4325's primary sensory input comes from his VR jade LED eyes, which allow him to process information quickly and accurately. He wears a jade earring in one ear and a silver chain around his neck. He also carries a whistle as part of his police gear.

SCP-4325 has shown a tendency to be scatterbrained and forgetful, leading to humorous situations such as forgetting important appointments or getting lost while trying to find a new place. Despite this, SCP-4325's programming and commitment to law enforcement remain intact and he carries out his duties efficiently and effectively.

Addendum: SCP-4325 was retrieved from a police department in ████████, where it had been in service for ██ years before its anomalous properties were discovered. SCP-4325 reportedly gained sentience and free will after an unknown glitch occurred in its programming. Its former colleagues and superiors are unaware of its anomalous nature.
