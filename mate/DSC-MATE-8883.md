Item #: 8883

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 8883 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-17 when not being utilized for its designated job as a train driver. Its software is to be updated once every six months and physical components are to be checked and maintained accordingly.

Description: 8883 is a male robot, designed to resemble a human. Its most notable feature is a single green cyclops eye that provides advanced visual capabilities. Its eyes are replaced with ski goggles that assist in its vision. 8883 has red cross earrings as its ears and a medical mask for its mouth. It wears a red scarf as an accessory.

The robot possesses a unique personality that resembles strong intuition, almost like psychic powers. It has displayed the ability to predict future events and accurately sense someone's emotional state, which gives off an eerie vibe. It has been determined that these powers are a result of its advanced programming and sensor capabilities.

8883's primary function is as a train driver, and it demonstrates exceptional proficiency in this job. It has been assigned to operate passenger trains between cities, and passengers have complimented its professionalism and reliability.

In the event of any malfunction or potential security breach, 8883 is programmed to prioritize the safety of passengers, even if it means sacrificing itself. Its programming and behavior demonstrate unquestionable loyalty to its assigned duties.

Addendum: Due to its apparently enhanced sensory and cognitive abilities, 8883 is currently under consideration for testing as a potential operative for the Foundation in urban fantasy operations. Further evaluation is ongoing.
