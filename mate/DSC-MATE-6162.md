Item #: 6162

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6162 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a computer, a bed, and a nearby facility for fresh air and sunlight as needed. Personnel who interact with subject 6162 must wear gas masks at all times, and be aware of her emotional vulnerability. Subjects who exhibit aggressive behavior towards subject 6162 will be removed from her presence immediately.

Description: 

Subject 6162 is a humanoid entity that appears to be a human female of average height and weight with bright orange stripes across her face and red lips. Her eyes are implanted with VR Rainbow LED devices, giving her an otherworldly appearance. Her head is adorned with green hair with edge curls and a rubber gas mask, which they wear around their neck. A pair of goggles above her forehead is worn as an accessory, and she has red cross earrings, a gold chain, and a gas mask that she wears to protect herself from airborne toxins.

Personality:

Subject 6162 possesses a deeply empathetic nature towards those around her, and she becomes emotional and distressed when someone else suffers. Her fondness for animals and nature is evident, and she enjoys spending time outdoors, especially in environments with a natural aesthetic. However, she can become hostile when confronted with perceived injustices and will often defend those who she perceives as 'victims' at any cost. Her overall personality is a puzzling mixture of empathy, aggression, and protectiveness.

Addendum:

Subject 6162 was discovered when authorities traced electronic money transfers to her bank account of stolen money from her clients. She was subsequently arrested and found guilty of fraud. However, during her trial, the judge revealed that he felt an inexplicable emotional connection towards her that caused him to overlook her legal infringements. It is evident that her mere presence can profoundly influence those around her. Further research is required to understand the extent of subject 6162's abilities.
