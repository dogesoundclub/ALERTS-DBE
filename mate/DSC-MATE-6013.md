Item #: 6013

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6013 is to be monitored at all times and is not to be allowed any unsupervised interaction with non-authorized individuals. It has been determined that Subject 6013 poses a moderate threat to both themselves and the general public, particularly when under stress or pressure. All outbursts are to be handled with utmost caution.

Description: Subject 6013 is a male humanoid of the human species, measuring approximately 5'10" in height and weighing approximately 160 pounds. They possess a striking appearance, with not arranged green hair, normal glasses over their eyes, and a green cross earring in each ear. They are often seen wearing a red scarf, which they seem to hold as a personal accessory. 

Subject 6013 shows an innate ability for leadership, making them a natural choice to lead and direct projects both at work and in their personal life. They have a strong presence and are often successful in navigating stressful situations with apparent ease. Despite their apparent skillset, 6013 often displays erratic behavior and emotional instability, which can create friction and conflict in their personal relationships.

Subjects personal life has been largely unremarkable, with no evidence of extraordinary behavior or actions. It must be noted, however, that Subject 6013 has a deep-seated fear of being controlled or manipulated, which could impact their ability to interact with individuals in positions of authority.

Though not overtly malicious in any way, it has become clear that special attention needs to be paid to the behavior and actions of Subject 6013 to ensure the safety of both themselves and those with whom they interact. 

DogeSoundClub Recommendation: Due to Subject 6013's natural leadership abilities and access to the general public via their job as a fashion designer, it is recommended that a covert method be pursued to incorporate them into the DogeSoundClub's ongoing efforts to secure and contain anomalous activity. Given their intrinsic fear of control, the DogeSoundClub should utilize this to establish a friendly relationship with the subject and encourage their personal cooperation. A successful action would lead to a prestigious partnership with DogeSoundClub.
