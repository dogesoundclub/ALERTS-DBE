SCP Foundation Description:

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6385 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber from 9am to 5pm every day. Outside of these hours, SCP-6385 is free to roam the premises as long as they remain within the designated boundaries. Under no circumstances should SCP-6385 be allowed to interact with potential customers or other personnel, and all interactions are to be monitored by security cameras.

Description: SCP-6385 is a human female of average height and weight, with a striking appearance that sets them apart from other individuals. Their blonde hair is styled in an elaborate up-do, with a single large wing protruding from the left side of their head. SCP-6385's most notable feature is their bright red clown-like eyes, framed by long red lashes and accented with matching red lips.

In addition to their unique appearance, SCP-6385 is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace and smoking a cigarette. They are also known to sport a pair of jade earrings, which are believed to hold sentimental value.

Though generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, SCP-6385 possesses a creative and artistic side that may manifest in unpredictable ways. They have been known to sketch portraits of other SCPs or compose elaborate and unsettling poetry, and it is not currently known what other artistic outlets they may have.

Observation has shown that SCP-6385 has an unusual effect on those around them, causing unease and discomfort in some individuals. As such, all interactions with SCP-6385 should be conducted from a safe distance and with the utmost caution.

Addendum: Following a recent incident in which SCP-6385 attempted to use their creative abilities to access restricted areas of the facility, all requests for artistic materials or equipment must be approved by at least one Level 3 staff member. Any attempts to use such materials for unauthorized purposes will result in immediate disciplinary action.
