This individual possesses a unique appearance characterized by striking orange stripes that appear prominently on their facial features. Their head is parted down the middle, revealing a pink coloration that has yet to be explained by any known genetic factors. SCP-6520 can be easily identifiable by the medical mask that they wear over their mouth and the gold chain that adorns their neck.

Despite their bizarre appearance, SCP-6520 exhibits an extraordinary sense of empathy that has been noted by colleagues and patients alike.
