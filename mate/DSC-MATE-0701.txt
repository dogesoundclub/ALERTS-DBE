Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-701 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Personnel interacting with SCP-701 are to do so via a one-way communication system to prevent exposure to its highly unusual eyes.

Description: SCP-701 is a seemingly normal human male, approximately 27 years old, standing at 5'9". However, he possesses highly abnormal cybernetic eyes that emit a variable, rainbow-colored light. SCP-701's head is covered by a blue bandana, and it wears a jade earring in one ear.

SCP-701 works as a fast food worker, showing no signs of any anomalous behavior when performing its job. However, it displays a highly introspective personality, often found lost in thought for extended periods, leading to occasional humorous mishap.

SCP-701's eyes can cause various visual and neurological effects, potentially leading to sensory overload for individuals who gaze into them for extended periods. In most cases, exposure is innocuous and can cause temporary visual illusions or feelings of euphoria.

Addendum 701-1: During a routine equipment check, SCP-701's cybernetic eyes underwent a mysterious technological upgrade, allowing for heightened visual acuity and improved color perception. This event sparked much curiosity and investigation into the anomalous mechanisms behind SCP-701's unique eyes. Further upgrades are possible in the future, and further research is ongoing.
