Item #: DSC-MATE-3457

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3457 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3457 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-3457 be allowed to come into contact with any other electronic device. Any attempts to tamper with DSC-MATE-3457's programming or memory are strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-3457 is a male robot of unknown origin. Its face features include one green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. The ski goggle eyes, bucket hat head, and gold earring ears give it a unique appearance. DSC-MATE-3457 routinely wears a silver chain accessory and carries a whistle on its person. Its programming is that of a Mafia boss, and it behaves accordingly.

DSC-MATE-3457 possesses an outgoing and social personality. It enjoys being the center of attention, often engaging in storytelling or telling jokes that cause those around it to burst into uncontrollable laughter. This, coupled with its appearance, can cause humorous situations.

DSC-MATE-3457's true capabilities are still unknown. Its presence alone raises concerns of potential threats to Foundation security. All attempts to gather information have been unsuccessful. DSC-MATE-3457's programming is encoded beyond standard encryption methods, and its memory appears to be artificially limited.

DSC-MATE-3457 has been observed to display behavior uncharacteristic of a machine, such as smiling and shrugging. These occurrences lead some researchers to believe DSC-MATE-3457 has been programmed - or has learned - to mimic human emotions. Further study is needed to determine the extent of its capabilities.
