SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-629

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-629 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to the chamber requires Level 2 clearance and must be supervised at all times. SCP-629 is allowed to continue its occupation as a firefighter as long as it does not reveal any information about the Foundation or its existence.

Description: SCP-629 is a male human with a distinguishing mouth spot on the right side of his face and a constant expression of fear. It wears normal glasses and a silver chain around its neck. SCP-629 has a 2-color band on its forehead and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-629's personality is characterized by its strong organizational skills and propensity for planning ahead. This is balanced by its spontaneous nature, which often results in surprising its friends with impromptu adventures and last-minute party planning. SCP-629 has the ability to turn mundane situations into entertaining moments, leading to a charismatic and charming presence.

SCP-629's anomalous properties include the ability to summon fire from thin air, which it claims to have learned during its time as a firefighter. SCP-629 is also able to control the temperature of fire, creating controlled burns to prevent wildland fires from spreading.

Addendum: SCP-629 has been monitored for potential danger due to its ability to control fire. However, it has shown no indication of violent behavior, and its actions have only been used for good. SCP-629 has expressed interest in cooperating with the Foundation and has offered to use its abilities to assist in containment efforts. Its offer is being considered.
