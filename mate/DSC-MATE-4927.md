Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be kept under watch at all times, with a 24/7 surveillance team in place. Contact and interaction with the outside world is to be limited to only professional settings, specifically in a news anchoring capacity.

Description: Subject appears to be a male human with distinctive spotted patches on his face. His mouth shows signs of constant fear, and his glasses seem almost permanently placed onto his face. The subject also has a prominent spiked hairstyle, with a gold earring on each ear and a silver chain around his neck. 

Subject's personality traits are that of a highly organized individual who likes to plan ahead but also has a spontaneous side to him. Unfortunately, this spontaneous behavior often leads to risky and dangerous situations. It is believed that this behavior stems from a need to seek out and report news first, leading him to act without sufficient caution. 

Subject has been observed to have a great sense of humor, often leading impromptu adventures that can cause unexpected consequences. Despite his highly unpredictable nature, he is well-liked by colleagues and the general public.

It is highly recommended that no one attempt to interact with the subject outside of professional settings. Attempting to bring him into a social situation or party atmosphere may result in unpredictable behavior, and it is unknown how he will react to such situations. 

Any further testing or exposure to such unpredictable situations must first be approved by at least two senior staff members. It is imperative that the safety of both the subject and the surrounding environment be maintained at all times.
