Item #: 4596

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4596 is to be allowed to remain at its current location as the manager of the local theater. No interference in its day-to-day activities is necessary, as it poses no known risk to the surrounding area. In the event of SCP-4596 displaying signs of distress or abnormal behavior, agents are to be dispatched to investigate.

Description: SCP-4596 is a male rabbit of unknown origin. It stands approximately 1 meter tall and wears a red beanie on its head, adorned with a two-color band. SCP-4596's eyes are red-colored clown's eyes, and it has a gold earring in its left ear. SCP-4596 can speak and understands human language fluently.

SCP-4596's primary accessory is a standard gas mask, presumably to avoid inhaling any potential airborne toxins or contaminants. While SCP-4596's motivations for wearing the mask remain unknown, it has been observed to cause no significant hindrance to its ability to communicate or carry out human activities. 

SCP-4596 is an empathetic and compassionate entity, showing great care and concern towards those around it. However, SCP-4596 has been observed to take on the problems of others as its own, leading to feelings of exhaustion and stress. Subjects interacting with SCP-4596 describe feelings of comfort and a sense of understanding.

Addendum: Due to SCP-4596's benign nature and affinity for the theater, the Foundation has allowed it to continue its activities uninterrupted. SCP-4596 has expressed gratitude for this allowance and has offered to provide Foundation personnel with tickets to upcoming shows. This offer has been declined.
