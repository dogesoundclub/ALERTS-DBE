**Item #:** 105

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject 105 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell should be equipped with a standard bed, toilet, sink, and a small exercise area. The subject is to be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards, through observation cameras and regular check-ins. All communication with the subject is to be handled through a secure, one-way intercom system. No physical contact is allowed with any personnel or other DSCs.

**Description:** Subject 105 appears to be a male human in his mid-30s. He has a frightened-looking mouth that seems to be in a perpetual state of tension, as if he is always on the verge of panic. He wears a pair of nerd glasses that appear to be purely cosmetic, as his vision is normal. He also wears a green cross earring in his left ear, which appears to be a symbol of some sort of religious affiliation. He is always seen wearing a red scarf and a standard gas mask.

Subject 105's personality is highly organized and efficient, though bordering on obsessive. He tends to take charge of group projects or events and delegates tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. This behavior can sometimes be perceived as controlling or domineering, and has led to humorous situations in the past. However, it is clear that the subject's control issues extend to more serious situations and when he is faced with opposition or a loss of control, he can become agitated and unpredictable.

**Addendum:** Subject 105 has been classified as a villain in previous encounters with Foundation personnel. He has displayed a willingness to use violent means to achieve his objectives and has demonstrated a high level of skill in hand-to-hand combat and tactical planning. It is recommended that all personnel exercise extreme caution when interacting with subject 105, and that any attempts at negotiation or coercion be handled by experienced operatives.
