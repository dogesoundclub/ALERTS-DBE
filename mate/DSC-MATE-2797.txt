Item #: SCP-2797

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2797 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with a reinforced steel door capable of withstanding its considerable strength. The cell should also be furnished with a comfortable bed and furnishings appropriate for a feline humanoid, including a scratching post and a supply of catnip. SCP-2797 is to be fed a diet of raw meat and kept under constant observation to ensure its well-being.

Description: SCP-2797 is a male tiger humanoid that appears to be wearing a police cap on its head, with ski goggle eyes and a silver chain around its neck. SCP-2797 stands approximately 2.5 meters tall and possesses considerable strength, agility and speed.

SCP-2797 is a banker by profession, but is known to exhibit characteristics that are unusual for its species. It displays a great deal of empathy and compassion towards other beings, often placing the burden of their problems upon itself. This can lead to SCP-2797 feeling responsible for fixing everyone and everything around it, causing it to become overburdened and exhausted.

SCP-2797 has been known to engage in self-harm when it feels that it has failed to help others, and it can be difficult to dissuade it from its self-destructive behavior, despite the potential dangers to its well-being.

Addendum: SCP-2797 was first detected by Foundation agents in [REDACTED], where it was working as a teller in a local bank. After exhibiting unusual behavior, it was provided with a cover story and taken into Foundation custody.

SCP-2797 has shown remarkable intelligence and understanding, despite its non-humanoid appearance. It has been deemed a valuable asset to the Foundation, and further research is ongoing to understand its unique abilities and characteristics.
