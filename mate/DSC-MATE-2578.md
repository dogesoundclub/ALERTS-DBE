Item #: 2578

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2578 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Food and drink must be supplied daily, along with various objects for anthropomorphizing purposes. Any inanimate objects within Subject 2578's containment chamber must be regularly monitored for signs of anomalous activity.

Description: Subject 2578 is a male rabbit with vibrant VR Rainbow LED eyes and a single Jade Earring in its left ear. The subject is often seen wearing a Gold Chain and carrying a Whistle for unknown purposes. Subject 2578 is notable for its intense care and empathy towards inanimate objects. It often talks to these objects as if they were sentient beings, giving them names and anthropomorphizing them in various ways. Despite this supposed ability to communicate with the inanimate, there have been no verifiable instances of anomalous activity displayed by these objects.

Personality: Subject 2578 is a highly empathetic and nurturing individual who cares deeply for creatures both animate and inanimate. While its vast empathy and connection to these objects are impressive, it can cause problems if Subject 2578 begins to exhibit delusions of grandeur in thinking that these inanimate objects are sentient beings. As such, Subject 2578 is predisposed to obsession and is likely to become over-enthusiastic when given new subjects to care for. For the safety of both Subject 2578 and those within its vicinity, it is essential to monitor its activities closely.
