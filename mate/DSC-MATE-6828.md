Description: Subject 6828 appears to be a 40-something-year-old human female, with a prominent pattern of dark spots covering their face. They possess a pair of red clown eyes that appear to stare with an unnerving intensity. Their lips are painted a bright red, and they wear a pair of goggles on their brow at all times.

Subject 6828's fashion sense seems to conform to that of an early 2000s schoolgirl, complete with a gold earring and chain as accessories. It is notable that they seem almost fixated on their appearance, and can often be seen checking themselves in mirrors or reflective surfaces.

Personality: Subject 6828 is usually charming and well-spoken, choosing their words carefully to make convincing arguments. They have a reputation for being a skilled politician, with a talent for persuasion and negotiation. However, they have been known to become violent when their artistic sensibilities are thwarted or ignored.

Subject 6828 is capable of some artistic expression, with a preference for painting and writing. However, they take their craft very seriously and can become enraged if they feel their work is not receiving the attention it deserves. It is recommended that any artifacts or art associated with the subject be kept far away from them.

Addendum: Subject 6828 became agitated during a routine check-in and managed to break free of their restraints. They armed themselves with several writing implements and proceeded to vandalize the walls of their holding cell. It is recommended that all future interactions with the subject be conducted with extreme caution.
