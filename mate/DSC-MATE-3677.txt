SCP-3677, designated as "The Purple-Lipped Beautician," is a human female with striking red clown eyes that seem to pierce through the very soul of whoever is looking at them. Her head is adorned with a bucket hat that seems impossibly small for her head, but somehow stays firmly in place. Hanging from her ears are large, dangling red cross earrings.

Her most noticeable feature, however, is her purple lipstick that seems to be permanently painted onto her lips. Though it may seem a simple fashion choice to some, our research suggests that it may have deeper, possibly occult, significance.

SCP-3677's chosen profession as a beautician is somewhat unusual, as it is often the aesthetics industry that prefers conventional beauty standards. However, her skills are highly sought after by clients due to her ability to bring out the individual qualities of each person she works on, rather than attempting to mold everyone into one same look.

Despite her otherworldly appearance, SCP-3677 is highly social and has a great sense of humor. She values her social connections and often spends her free time cracking jokes and engaging in playful banter with her friends and colleagues.

While SCP-3677's supernatural capabilities have yet to be fully understood or documented, we highly advise caution when approaching her. She may appear to be simply a quirky and outgoing beautician, but her eccentricities and unusual appearance may hint at deeper, more dangerous facets yet to be unveiled.
