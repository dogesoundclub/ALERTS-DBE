Object class: Humanoid, Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9250 is to be assigned as a security guard at the Site-19 facility. Due to her strong belief in justice, SCP-9250 is to be kept informed only of the necessary information regarding the containment of other SCP objects in order to avoid any potential actions brought about by her idealistic tendencies. SCP-9250 is to undergo monthly psychological evaluations and remain under strict observation for any signs of erratic behavior.

Description: SCP-9250 is a female human of average height and weight with distinctive spots on her face, a purple lip, and orange eyebrows. SCP-9250 is commonly seen wearing a black hoodie with a two-colored band across her forehead, a silver chain, and holding a cigarette in her left hand. Despite SCP-9250’s appearance, her abilities and strengths are not anomalous in any way.

Personality: SCP-9250 is known for her idealistic personality and strong desire to make the world a better place. While her intentions are commendable, her strong beliefs tend to lead her into humorous situations, such as protesting or boycotting a company or cause that she feels goes against her values. SCP-9250 has been observed to be highly vocal in her opinions, and frequently poses a potential security risk should she decide to take matters into her own hands.

Anyone caught attempting to take advantage of SCP-9250’s idealistic nature for personal gain will face severe consequences.

Recovery Log: SCP-9250 was discovered in ██████, where she was previously employed as a freelance security guard for various companies.

Foundation agents were able to contain SCP-9250 without incident and relocated her to Site-19 for further containment and observation.

SCP-9250 is now a valuable member of the Site-19 community, serving the Foundation as a loyal security guard. Endeavors have been made to assist SCP-9250 in recognizing and conforming to the regulations put in place by the Foundation in order to ensure the continued saftey and security of all personnel involved.
