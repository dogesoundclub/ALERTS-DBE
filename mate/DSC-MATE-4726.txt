Item #: 4726

Object Class: Keter

Sex: Male

Description: SCP-4726 is a male rabbit of the Oryctolagus cuniculus genus. It stands at an average height of 50 cm and has blue clown eyes, which appear to glow in dimly lit areas. It constantly wears a hoodie with a red scarf draped around the neck and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

Personality: SCP-4726 is a highly intelligent and cunning individual with a love for adventure. It enjoys taking risks and trying new things, which has led to some humorous stories among those who have worked with it. SCP-4726 shows a charismatic personality, enjoys being in control, and has no visible empathy towards any form of rival. SCP-4726 is always accompanied by armed men, some of which seem to be influenced by an unknown form of power that SCP-4726 seems to have.

Containment: Due to its status as a high-ranking member of the mafia, SCP-4726 must remain contained within a maximum-security facility that is isolated from the general public. It is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber and monitored at all times, with armed personnel on standby.

On occasions where SCP-4726 must be transported, it is to be kept in a secure, isolated container that offers no avenue for escape. Local law enforcement is to be informed, and temporary roadblocks established until transport of SCP-4726 is completed.

Note: SCP-4726 has demonstrated a wide range of anomalous abilities, including telekinesis, teleportation, and aura projection, among other abilities. Further study is underway to determine the extent of its abilities and how they function. It is considered highly dangerous, and interactions with SCP-4726 require explicit clearance from Site Director.
