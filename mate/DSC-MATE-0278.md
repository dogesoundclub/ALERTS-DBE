Item #: DSC-MATE-278

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-278 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with enriching items such as a radio and a television. Due to their profession, DSC-MATE-278 is permitted to work as a firefighter during operational hours, under the watchful eye of a Foundation liaison.

DSC-MATE-278's equipment must be kept in a secure locker at all times when not in use. Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to attempt tampering or removal of any of DSC-MATE-278's gear or accessories.

Description: DSC-MATE-278 is a male simian of the genus Macaca, commonly known as the Monkey species. DSC-MATE-278's appearance is characterized by their ski goggle-like eyes, followed by a not arranged green head, and the unique feature on their forehead - which is a goggle - as well as a gold earring on each ear.

Their outfit consists of a set of standard firefighter gear and an LED gas mask used to breathe in hazardous environments. DSC-MATE-278's personality is described as an individual with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. Their occupation as a firefighter is a reflection of such traits. Despite DSC-MATE-278's serious nature towards their profession, they can also be carefree and enjoy themselves, sometimes to the point of being the life of the party.

DSC-MATE-278's playful nature is a double-edged sword, as they may accidentally cause humorous situations, such as getting others to dance or sing to their favorite songs, during a mission when they should be solely focused on completion.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-278 has offered to conduct demonstrations of their rescue techniques for Foundation personnel during downtime to ease the monotony of life within containment. Ethical considerations for such demonstrations have yet to be approved.
