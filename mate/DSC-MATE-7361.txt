Item#: 7361

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7361 is to be monitored continuously via closed-circuit cameras and audio recorders installed in its living space, and any abnormal activities or behavior must be reported immediately to the designated personnel. SCP-7361 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a bed, a toilet, and a desk, and all items provided to SCP-7361 must be thoroughly checked for any possible anomalies before clearance. SCP-7361 is not allowed to communicate with any other SCP within the Foundation.

Description: SCP-7361 is a male rabbit approximately 1.1 meters in height and weighing around 23 kilograms. SCP-7361 appears to be just like any ordinary rabbit, but with several distinguishing features that make it anomalous. SCP-7361 wears a black bucket hat over its head, covering its eye structure, and has one gold earring on its left ear. SCP-7361 also wears a silver chain around its neck and carries a whistle in its pocket.

SCP-7361 has a unique personality that makes it difficult to categorize. SCP-7361 is vastly knowledgeable and often provides insightful counsel, yet displays a lack of interest in politics. Strangely, SCP-7361 has attained a high rank in the local government and is known to have a reputation for being a "political mastermind" despite no apparent knowledge of the subject.

SCP-7361 typically exercises good work ethics and likes to maintain organization and order in its immediate vicinity. SCP-7361 is occasionally prone to impulsive actions, which in turn makes for a very unpredictable personality. SCP-7361 has also shown proficient capabilities in navigating the digital world and has outwitted several data breaches that have otherwise exposed the Foundation's sensitive information.

Addendum: SCP-7361 has not given any clear explanation with regard to its anomalous abilities or purpose. The Foundation is still observing SCP-7361 for further anomalies and conducting research for suitable containment procedures.
