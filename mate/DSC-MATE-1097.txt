Item #: SCP-1097

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1097 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with appropriate monitoring equipment and psychic dampeners. Due to the inherently empathic nature of SCP-1097, any interactions with Foundation personnel must be conducted through audiovisual means, with no direct physical contact.

SCP-1097's access to cosmetic products is to be restricted, with all supplies being provided and monitored by site staff. Any requests for additional items or modifications must be pre-approved by a minimum of two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-1097 is a female human, approximately 28 years of age, with distinctive blue clown eyes and a perpetual smile. SCP-1097 displays numerous cosmetic modifications, including a tiara, dual-colored forehead band, a silver chain, and a single jade earring.

SCP-1097's primary profession is as a beautician, with a deep understanding and appreciation for the human form. Additionally, SCP-1097 has demonstrated considerable empathy for the suffering of others, often becoming emotionally overwhelmed in response to extreme distress or trauma.

The precise origin of SCP-1097's anomalous abilities remains unknown. It is hypothesized that SCP-1097's emotional sensitivity is linked to her unique appearance and heightened sense of aesthetic sensibility.

Addendum: During routine psychological evaluations, SCP-1097 expressed an affinity for animals and nature. Further exploration of this aspect of SCP-1097's personality may prove valuable for integrating her into Foundation operations involving environmental or zoological research.
