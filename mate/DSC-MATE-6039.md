Item #: 6039

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6039, also known as the Rabbit Designer, is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with a constant supply of candy sticks. The cell must be kept organized and clean at all times, as to satisfy the subject's natural inclination towards orderliness. Any tasks given to them for their own entertainment should be monitored closely to avoid triggering their controlling tendencies.

Description: Subject 6039 appears as a male rabbit with a green head and a pair of horned rim glasses, typically found holding a candy stick in their paw. They are a fashion designer by profession and, as such, are often seen dressed in the latest trendy outfits. However, their most notable trait is their high level of organization and efficiency, almost to the point of being controlling. 

Subject 6039 is known to take charge of group projects and events with a very matter-of-fact attitude, occasionally delegating tasks to others in an authoritative manner. While this can lead to humorous situations, it also makes them a bit difficult to work with at times. It is also notable that the subject appears to have an affinity for candy, often using it as a reward for completing tasks or as a stress-reliever during times of high pressure.

Overall, while not outwardly dangerous, the controlling nature of Subject 6039 requires close monitoring and management to avoid causing disruption and conflict within the facility. Extreme caution is advised when interacting with them, especially when given tasks or responsibilities.
