Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2720 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███.

SCP-2720 is allowed to work as a security guard at Site-███, under the supervision of a designated site security officer.

Description: SCP-2720 is a human male of average build and height. SCP-2720's face has an irregular spot just above the upper lip, which is slightly darker than the surrounding skin. When frightened, SCP-2720's mouth curves upwards, giving the appearance of a permanent smile. SCP-2720's eyes emit a green glow similar to Jade LED, a type of virtual reality lens technology. SCP-2720 is always wearing a red beanie, a green cross earring, and a red scarf. SCP-2720 also carries a normal gas mask as an additional accessory.

SCP-2720 has a reckless personality and does not often think things through before acting. This trait may lead to minor accidents or mishaps, often as a result of attempting to show off or impress others. As such, SCP-2720 is not to be assigned to tasks involving high-risk situations. SCP-2720 has cooperated with containment procedures and has not exhibited any anomalous abilities.

Addendum: During routine psychological evaluations, SCP-2720 has expressed a strong desire to become a Foundation researcher. Request for reassignment to research personnel denied.
