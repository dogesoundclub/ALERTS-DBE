Item #: SCP-2143

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-2143 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at site 17. Personal belongings, including the retro cap, nerd glasses, red scarf, and goggle on forehead must remain with the subject at all times. SCP-2143 is not allowed to bring any other objects into the cell without prior approval from personnel level 3 or higher. Any visitors to SCP-2143 must wear appropriate protective gear.

Description:

SCP-2143 appears to be an average human male in his early thirties. Physical examinations show no anomalous properties beyond those listed under "Face Feature" and "Accessory".

SCP-2143's most notable characteristic is his persistent attention to detail. This can manifest in seemingly minor activities, such as alphabetizing spices, color-coding clothes, and meticulously organizing tools. At times, the subject's attention to detail can border on obsessive. However, other than occasional periods of restlessness and agitation, SCP-2143 does not display any other significant behavioral abnormalities.

SCP-2143's role as an electrician is incidental to containment. The subject has demonstrated no particular aptitude or expertise beyond what would be expected from a professional with his experience and education.

Addendum:

SCP-2143 has exhibited a propensity for constructing objects using available materials, from craft objects to complex machines. While these objects have never utilized anomalous effects, personnel are reminded that even mundane machines may be employed in an attempt to escape containment or cause harm. Therefore, any construction by SCP-2143 must be approved by personnel level 3 or higher.
