Item #: SCP-1664

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1664 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, equipped with a fire suppression system. Due to the subject's occupation as a firefighter, they are to be given ample opportunities to practice their profession in a controlled environment, under the supervision of trained Foundation personnel. Personal items, such as the subject's cigarette, may be allowed as a calmative measure, with approval from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1664 appears to be a human male of average height and build, with distinctive facial features. The subject's face is covered in spots, and their mouth is perpetually twisted into a clown-like grin, with red eyes adding to their unsettling appearance. SCP-1664's head is adorned with a mohawk, with a two-color band across their forehead and a gold earring in each ear. 

The subject has demonstrated excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking, a trait that has earned them a reputation for being goal-oriented and ambitious. SCP-1664 has been known to take on more than they can handle, which has occasionally resulted in dangerous situations. However, the subject's training as a firefighter and their exceptional skills have allowed them to escape unscathed in most cases.

SCP-1664 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but shows signs of anxiety and irritability when confined for long periods. The subject is fond of their cigarette, which serves as a calming measure when provided. 

Addendum: SCP-1664 has requested access to a personal radio, citing the need to keep in touch with their colleagues on the job. After approval from the Site Director, the subject has been permitted to keep a radio in their cell, monitored by Foundation personnel.
