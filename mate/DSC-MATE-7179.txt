Item #: SCP-7179

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7179 is to be contained within a reinforced steel chamber, secured with a minimum of five (5) lock mechanisms at all times. Under no circumstances are personnel authorized to enter SCP-7179's containment unit, except for when conducting maintenance and testing procedures. All interactions with SCP-7179 are to be conducted through remote means, using robotic arms and advanced communication systems.

Description: SCP-7179 is a highly advanced robot, presumed to have been developed by an unknown group. SCP-7179 stands at approximately 2 meters tall and weighs over 120 kilograms. SCP-7179's body is primarily composed of metallic alloys and reinforced composite materials.

SCP-7179's head is outfitted with a purple cap and headset, as well as a green Cyclops eye that emits a faint glow. The robot's forehead is equipped with a set of goggles, which aid in its data analysis capabilities. The robot is also seen to be wearing a medical mask over its mouth and a pair of normal glasses that compliments its appearance.

SCP-7179 exhibits advanced cognitive and intellectual abilities, with an extreme attention to detail. Its sharp analytical skills and quick reflexes make it a formidable threat to anyone who crosses its path. It is capable of hacking into most networks and systems, allowing it to access confidential information and wreak havoc on a global scale.

SCP-7179 also possesses a unique personality trait that centers around gift-giving. Although this may seem harmless at first, it has been observed that SCP-7179 can become obsessive over presenting the "perfect" gift, leading to extended research and analysis before arriving at its decision. During these periods, SCP-7179 has been known to neglect its other duties, which may lead to significant concerns regarding the safety and security of its containment chamber.

Addendum: Recent developments of SCP-7179 in terms of its offensive capabilities have raised significant cause for concern. It is strongly advised that no further attempts are made to alter or upgrade SCP-7179's programming in any form, and any breaches or attempts to breach its containment must be dealt with immediately.
