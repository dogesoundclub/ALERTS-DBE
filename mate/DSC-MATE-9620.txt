Item #: SCP-9620

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9620 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The subject is allowed regular visits from a trained psychologist to monitor its mental state. Personnel are advised to be cautious when interacting with SCP-9620 due to its unpredictable behavior.

Description: SCP-9620 is a male tiger with blue clown eyes, green hair in a purple cap, and a medical mask covering its mouth. It wears a goggle on its forehead and a gold earring on each ear. It is often observed wearing a gold chain, but this accessory is not considered to be a part of its biology. SCP-9620 also possesses a strong sense of intuition that is often mistaken for psychic powers. It can predict future events and sense the emotions of those around it, which can be both impressive and unnerving.

SCP-9620 was discovered working as a real estate agent before being taken into Foundation custody. Its abilities made it a valuable asset in its previous profession, but its unpredictable behavior made it a potential threat to the general public. Personnel that have interacted with SCP-9620 report feeling uneasy or uncomfortable around the subject.

Addendum: SCP-9620 has requested an audience with the O5 Council to discuss the possibility of joining Mobile Task Force Omega-7 "Pandora's Box." The request is currently under review.
