Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4526 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with basic amenities. Due to DSC-MATE-4526's empathetic and compassionate nature, it is recommended that the chamber is periodically decorated to enhance the entity's psychological well-being and help mitigate its emotional distress.

DSC-MATE-4526 is to be monitored at all times through a CCTV system with audio capabilities. Any unusual behavior by DSC-MATE-4526 must be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-4526 is a humanoid entity which appears to be a male of the Homo sapiens species. DSC-MATE-4526 displays two distinct features on its face: multiple spots and a constant smile. Its eyes are notably red and resemble those of a clown.

DSC-MATE-4526 is often seen wearing a blue bandana around its head, reminiscent of a gang member. It also displays a green cross earring on one ear and a red scarf around its neck. The entity is often observed sporting loud and flamboyant clothing but has been noted to dress unremarkably to avoid drawing too much attention to itself.

DSC-MATE-4526 possesses extraordinary empathy and compassion, which it sometimes tends to express through its work as a theater manager. However, it has been observed that the entity falls into depressive states when exposed to the distress of others. DSC-MATE-4526 has a strong sense of responsibility, and it perceives fixing everyone's problems to be its official duty. This nature causes it to become emotionally exhausted and unstable.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4526 was initially discovered after it drew attention to itself while holding an impromptu street performance in a busy downtown area. The Foundation became aware of DSC-MATE-4526 due to the unusual attention it drew. Upon interviewing the entity, it was determined that it was unaware of its anomalous nature. DSC-MATE-4526 has been contained successfully and has cooperated with the Foundation in preserving object secrecy protocols.
