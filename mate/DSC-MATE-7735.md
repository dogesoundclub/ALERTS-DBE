Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7735 is to be contained within a soundproof chamber at all times, with only authorized personnel permitted access with proper protection and clearance. The subject has been fitted with a GPS tracker to monitor their movements at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-7735 is a human male, approximately 42 years of age, standing at 6'2" and weighing at 195 pounds. The subject's face features spots, and his eyes are red clown eyes, suggesting possible ties to an anomalous circus or entertainment group. DSC-MATE-7735 frequently wears a green-colored headpiece that appears to be of jade material and a gold chain accessory.

DSC-MATE-7735 is known to be a news anchor character, with his primary tendency of impulsive action and on-the-spot decision making. Such characteristics largely stem from his personality and unusual accessories, with his LED gas mask modifying his behavior and suppressing natural human responses to stress.

DSC-MATE-7735 can be a psychologically unstable, anarchic figure, often leading to the inadvertent creation of anomalous situations involving subjects in his vicinity. DSC-MATE-7735 has been known to disregard authority in situations where emotions or instincts take over, at times resulting in humorous or unexpected actions.

Addendum: On 09/05/20██, DSC-MATE-7735's mask took on a malfunction, expanding his impulsive nature to intense levels, resulting in Foundation authorities to intervene and contain the identified area. The mask has since been recovered and tested for additional anomalous properties. DSC-MATE-7735 remains under heavy observation and containment, pending further evaluation.
