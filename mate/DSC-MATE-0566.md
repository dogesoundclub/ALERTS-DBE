Item #: 566

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 566 is currently held in a secure facility, guarded by skilled agents trained in the containment and restraint of anomalous entities. In the interest of public safety, communication with 566 is limited to authorized personnel only. No one is to make physical contact with 566 without explicit permission from a Level 5 researcher.

Description: 566 appears as a humanoid robot with a Doge hat over its head and ski goggles as eyes. An external analysis revealed that 566 is powered through a unique and potentially infinite power source from an unknown origin. It carries a whistle with it at all times, which, when blown, has been reported to have disorienting effects on those within earshot.

566 is a known Mafia Boss, with a vast network of contacts and informants located throughout the city. Its business dealings are heavily guarded and difficult to track, making it one of the most elusive entities in the underground community.

Despite its role as a criminal mastermind, 566 is known to have a humorous and playful side. It often surprises its peers with seemingly random dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor. This is in stark contrast to its strong sense of duty and responsibility, which often leads it to take extreme measures to protect its interests and those of its associates.

While the full extent of 566's abilities and motives remain unknown, it is clear that it poses a significant threat to the safety and stability of the city. Authorities are advised to approach with caution and to seek the assistance of specialized units if necessary.
