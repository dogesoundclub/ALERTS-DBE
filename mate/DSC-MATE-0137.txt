SCP-137 is the code designation for a female delivery driver operating within the urban area. She looks like a regular human with spots on her face, but her eyes are unnaturally bright and blue, giving off a strange clown-like appearance. SCP-137 is often seen wearing a hoodie, which she pulls up to obscure her face during deliveries.

Despite her odd looks, SCP-137 is a charismatic figure, able to connect with others on a deep emotional level. In many cases, she has been observed to get perfect strangers to open up about their life stories or share intimate details, which often leads to humorous and lighthearted conversations.

SCP-137 is also known for wearing a silver chain around her neck, which seems to be of no particular significance. However, it might be worth monitoring this accessory more closely.

SCP-137's potential for creating strong emotional bonds with people could be utilized in several urban fantasy scenarios, such as a courier for a supernatural organization or a negotiator between warring factions. However, extreme caution should be exercised when dealing with this SCP since her true motives and capabilities are not yet fully understood.
