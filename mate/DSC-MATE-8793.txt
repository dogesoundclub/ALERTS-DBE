Item #: SCP-8793

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8793 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. No special precautions are necessary, but it should be noted that SCP-8793 is to be treated with respect, given its importance in various communities.

Description: SCP-8793 is a humanoid figure with orange stripes on its face, and blue clown eyes. It always wears a red beanie and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-8793 is a male human, who works as a programmer.

SCP-8793 has a no-nonsense attitude and values traditions that have been passed down to him by his family and cultural community. However, he also has a playful side, and often tells jokes or stories that have been passed down through generations.

SCP-8793's ability to blend in among humans is a unique trait, as he is often seen as an eccentric but harmless programmer, rather than an entity with supernatural ability. SCP-8793’s true capabilities are a closely guarded secret among the Foundation and other similar organizations.

Addendum: SCP-8793 has assisted the Foundation in various projects, most notably with the creation of programs used by the Foundation in its daily operations. In light of this, SCP-8793 has been granted a certain level of autonomy and limited access to the inter-site computer network.
