Description: DSC-MATE-3787 is a juvenile male baboon, exhibiting typical physical traits of their species with the addition of a jade earring and a gold chain. DSC-MATE-3787 sports parted pink hair and reflective nerd glasses, further peculiarities that make their appearance easily recognizable.

DSC-MATE-3787’s behavior is considered odd and uncharacteristic of their species. Frequently noted behavior includes being attentive and overly fixated on details, particularly when it comes to picking the “perfect” gift for others. This behavior has been described as both a potential asset and a hindrance based on specific situations.

DSC-MATE-3787 was originally discovered in downtown metropolitan areas within the boundaries of a widely known national park. Due to the odd nature of their behaviors, as well as their aforementioned markings and accessories, further examination confirmed that DSC-MATE-3787 was initially part of some sort of street performer group.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3787 has formed a fondness towards the wildlife photography books added to their chamber. Research to further develop this pleasing trend is still ongoing.
