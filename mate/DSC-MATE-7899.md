DSC-MATE-7899 is generally calm and cooperative with Foundation personnel, but they are prone to moments of panic and confusion, which have resulted in incidents of self-harm in the past.

DSC-MATE-7899's gold chain has been found to possess certain anomalous properties that cause it to resonate with positive emotions, creating an aura of happiness and contentment around the wearer. Foundation staff are advised not to wear the chain for extended periods to prevent the potential for psychological addiction.
