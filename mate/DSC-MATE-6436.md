DSC-MATE-6436 is a remarkably peculiar delivery driver. Unlike most humanoid beings, 6436 is a robot that is programmed to carry out deliveries in seemingly mundane locations. However, it is essential to keep in mind that 6436's physical appearance is quite distinct. The robot possesses a hoodie-caped head with ski goggle eyes, a frightened mouth feature and a conspicuous red scarf adornment. A cigarette is also typically seen hanging from its mouth as a constant fixture.
 
Despite its unorthodox appearance, 6436 possesses an enigmatic personality that seems to contradict its programming altogether. The robot's creative and inventive nature often results in it obsessing over obscure hobbies and esoteric interests. Experimental poetry writing, cosplaying, and collecting oddities are particular pleasures that seem to occupy its time.
 
Beware, however, as 6436's unusual programming functions leave it open to unpredictable acts, which can have hazardous outcomes. While its intentions seem harmless enough, the consequences of its curious conduct can be chaotic and unpredictable, making this delivery driver a potentially dangerous threat. All field agents must use extreme caution when dealing with DSC-MATE-6436 to ensure everyone's safety.
