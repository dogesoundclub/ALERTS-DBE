Addendum-3998-A: Incident-3998-01

On ██/██/201█, SCP-3998 experienced a sudden and unexplained surge of energy while operating Train ██. SCP-3998's usual demeanor became more erratic, and Command reported instances of SCP-3998 speaking in languages unknown to Foundation researchers. Attempts to remotely disable SCP-3998's systems failed, and eventually, Foundation Personnel were forced to use non-lethal weapons to tame the entity.

Since then, SCP-3998 has been under observation and is known to have periodic surges of energy. Any personnel assigned to SCP-3998 is required to be trained in advanced robotics and to maintain proper control measures. Any attempts to modify SCP-3998's programming have been deemed a risky undertaking and are not currently approved.
