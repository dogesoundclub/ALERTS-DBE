Item #: 9709

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9709 is to be contained in a secured room with reinforced walls at all times. Access to this chamber is restricted to personnel with level 3 security clearance or higher. All individuals who come into contact with Item 9709 must wear protective equipment at all times, as the subject has the potential to cause hallucinations in those who look into its eyes. In the event of a containment breach or unauthorized access, armed personnel are to be dispatched immediately and all individuals found should be administered Class A amnestics.

Description: Item 9709 is a male rabbit of an unknown species that stands approximately 1 meter tall when upright on its hind legs. The subject is recognizable by its bright red clown eyes, which emit a constant glow in low-light conditions. Item 9709 is often seen wearing a blue bandana with a goggle on its forehead and a silver chain around its neck. The subject also has a jade earring on its left ear. It identifies itself as a real estate agent, but its actual abilities or occupation are unknown.

Personality: Item 9709 has a seemingly jovial and humorous personality. It often tells jokes and makes people laugh, seemingly to keep the mood light-hearted in any given situation. This has led to some humorous but sometimes disruptive incidents during containment procedures, as the subject will often do silly impersonations or tell stories at inappropriate moments. It's unclear if this behavior stems from a genuine interest in comedy or is part of a more subtle attempt to manipulate those around it.

Addendum: As of ██/██/████, Item 9709 has been linked to several high-profile missing person cases in the greater metropolitan area. It is suspected that the subject may have psychic abilities, as many of its past clients have reportedly experienced vivid hallucinations after contact with the subject. Investigations are ongoing, and the nature and extent of Item 9709's abilities are currently unknown. All personnel are reminded not to look into the subject's eyes under any circumstances without proper protective equipment.
