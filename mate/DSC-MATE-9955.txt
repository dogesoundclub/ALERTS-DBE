Her fashion pieces often depict slogans and statements calling for social justice and equality, at times leading her to become involved in protests and boycotts she deems against her principles. SCP-9955's idealism and passion for pressing societal issues are felt through her designs and have garnered a significant following within the fashion industry.

Personality: SCP-9955 is known for being hypnotically idealistic about making the world a better place. She has a relentless desire to seek out and highlight societal injustices that deserve attention, leading her to become emotionally involved and dedicated to her work. Despite her idealism, SCP-9955 demonstrates an uncanny ability to stay calm and focused on her objectives under tremendous strain or opposition. SCP-9955's passion and commitment to her causes have also earned her a reputation for being unpredictable and risk-taking, leading to some humorous instances. SCP-9955 willingly put herself in danger before to protest against certain organizations she opposed. These instances can be explained by her fervent dedication to her principles and her expressed desire to make a difference in the world.
