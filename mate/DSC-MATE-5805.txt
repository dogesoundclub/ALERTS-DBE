Item #: SCP-5805

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5805 is to be monitored at all times by two or more security personnel in order to ensure prompt response in the event of unexpected behavior. Additionally, SCP-5805's schedule and responsibilities must be strictly regulated in order to avoid overworking and potential breach of secrecy. Any instances of SCP-5805 attempting to take on more tasks than deemed safe must be reported to Site-██ immediately.

Description: SCP-5805 is a male human train driver equipped with jade LED eyes, a blue bandana around his head, a gold earring on his right ear, and a silver chain around his neck. SCP-5805 displays no anomalous properties through physical means, and can be considered otherwise normal in appearance.

However, SCP-5805 displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which may lead to him attempting to take on more tasks than he can realistically manage. This attribute can be seen as a potential vulnerability should SCP-5805's workload exceed his physical and mental limitations, which could lead to unforeseen, and possibly undesirable consequences.

SCP-5805 has been cooperative with all SCP Foundation personnel and has thus far shown no indication of malicious intent or awareness of his anomalous designation.

Addendum-5805-B: SCP-5805 continues to perform his duties under strict guidelines and monitoring procedures. As of [REDACTED], SCP-5805 has displayed no further irregularities.
