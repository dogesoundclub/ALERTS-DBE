Item #: SCP-8658

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8658 is to be kept under surveillance at all times within a designated containment chamber. All personnel assigned to SCP-8658 must undergo regular psychological evaluations to ensure they are not being influenced by SCP-8658's anomalous effects. Any interaction with SCP-8658 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel beforehand.

Description: SCP-8658 is a male human with orange stripes on their face and a clown mouth. Their eyes are red clown eyes, and they wear a retro cap on their head, with a red scarf as an accessory. SCP-8658's appearance is known to cause feelings of unease and discomfort in those who interact with them, leading them to create social connections and providing a sense of harmony with others.

SCP-8658 possesses a unique ability to create humor and goofiness within their vicinity. This ability seems to be a form of mind-affecting compulsion, as those within the range of SCP-8658's anomalous effect have reported feeling the urge to join in on the playful banter or humor.

Notably, SCP-8658's ability to create humor is not limited to verbal interactions. They have been observed maintaining and repairing mechanical objects in a playful and almost silly manner, leading to moments of spectacle when mechanical components are unexpectedy launched out due to their playful approach to the machine.

Despite their seemingly harmless personality and compulsion, SCP-8658 must be handled with caution. It is believed that SCP-8658's ability to create humor and goofiness can be amplified to a dangerous degree if the fear or survival instincts of a human are triggered. In one incident, SCP-8658's contentment and sense of well-being were observed to multiply exponentially when faced with the challenge of repairing an SCP container with a malfunctioning automated turret system.

It is currently unknown what would cause SCP-8658 to trigger its dangerous compulsion abilities, and research is ongoing. Any personnel assigned to SCP-8658 must be prepared for a dynamic, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous environment.

Addendum: Request for project proposal: Considering SCP-8658's interest in mechanical repair and the creation of playful banter in the mechanical repair, it is recommended that a project be initiated with the purpose of involving SCP-8658 as a mechanical engineer or mechanic for the Foundation. The possibility of using SCP-8658 to handle various mechanical or technical tasks where unpredictable, but playful behavior is useful makes this project well-backed by our purposes as an organization.
