Item #: SCP-7927

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7927 is to be contained in a soundproof room at all times. Any communication with SCP-7927 must be done through written or recorded means. Under no circumstances should SCP-7927 be allowed to broadcast live. All recordings of SCP-7927 must be reviewed and edited extensively to prevent any memetic spread.

Description: SCP-7927 appears to be a human female, standing at 1.7 meters in height. Her appearance is characterized by orange stripes and a red lip. Her eyes are wide and have a red clown-like appearance. SCP-7927 is partial to styling her hair in pig tails, with goggles on her forehead and a red cross earring.

SCP-7927's deepest desire is to excite others and make them enthusiastic about anything she discusses. This has led to humorous yet dangerous situations, such as causing mass hysteria over trivial topics. SCP-7927's enthusiasm is so infectious that it has resulted in memetic spread to anyone within earshot.

SCP-7927's "accessory" is an LED gas mask that allows her to communicate with others without fear of spreading her contagious and dangerous enthusiasm. During containment, SCP-7927 has shown exceptional skills as a news anchor. However, any live broadcasts by SCP-7927 must be strictly prohibited as her memetic effects could quickly spiral out of control.

SCP-7927 has refused any and all attempts to alter or remove her unique features. As such, she poses a significant threat to the general public and must be kept under constant observation by Foundation personnel. Any sightings of SCP-7927 outside of containment must be reported immediately to the nearest Foundation outpost.
