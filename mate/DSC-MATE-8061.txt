Item #: SCP-8061

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8061 is to be monitored by at least one personnel at all times. Any recorded or observed anomalous activities are to be reported immediately to the Site Director. SCP-8061 is allowed to continue to work as a delivery driver, but must be supervised by designated personnel during work hours. Any interaction with SCP-8061 must be approved by Site Director.

Description: SCP-8061 is a human male delivery driver identified as Jeffery. SCP-8061 has a distinctive mouth spot on his upper lip and a perpetually frightened expression on his mouth. SCP-8061's eyes are modified with VR Jade LED and he wears a police cap on his head. He also wears a green cross earring on his left ear and a red scarf and cigarette are his signature accessories.

SCP-8061 has a very nurturing and caring personality, known to take care of his friends and family like they are his own children. Sometimes, this behavior can lead to humorous situations where he is seen excessively tending to their needs. Although SCP-8061 does not have any known anomalous abilities, it is recommended to handle his emotional state with caution as it might trigger his reactions.

Addendum: SCP-8061 was contained after a local resident reported a strange occurrence during one of his deliveries. SCP-8061 was found tending to the resident's ailing grandmother, which would have been unusual for a delivery driver to do. Upon investigation, SCP-8061 displayed his nurturing and caring behavior towards both the resident and the elderly woman, which led to his containment. Further research is needed to understand the extent of SCP-8061's behavior and its impact on those around him.
