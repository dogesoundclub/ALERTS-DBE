Item #: 6568

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 6568 is currently employed as a delivery driver for a local courier service in [redacted]. As long as 6568 continues to follow their assigned routes and does not deviate from their schedule, they do not pose a threat to the public.

Description: 6568 is a male rabbit with a frightened expression on their mouth. Their eyes are hidden behind normal glasses, but they often seem to be looking around nervously. Their head is not arranged neatly, with green fur sticking out in various directions. On their forehead, there is a two-color band that seems to be permanently attached to their fur.

6568's most distinguishing feature is the single jade earring in their left ear. They also wear a gold chain around their neck, and a candy stick can usually be seen hanging from their mouth.

Personality: Despite their nervous appearance, 6568 has a natural talent for leadership. They often find themselves taking charge of situations, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in their personal life. This trait has made them an invaluable employee at their current job, as they are able to quickly and efficiently adapt to changes in their route or schedule. However, it has also made them a target for those who wish to dominate or control others.

Although they are not known to be aggressive, 6568 has been known to lash out in self-defense when they feel threatened. Due to their small size and fragile appearance, they are often underestimated by others, but they are actually quite intelligent and resourceful.

Addendum: 6568 has reported a number of strange incidents while on the job, including seeing shadows moving in the corners of their vision and feeling an oppressive presence following them. These incidents have not been corroborated by other witnesses or captured on CCTV, leading some to speculate that 6568 may be experiencing some sort of hallucinations or delusions. Further observation and testing may be necessary to determine the cause of these incidents.
