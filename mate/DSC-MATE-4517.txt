Item #: 4517

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Fast Food Worker

Species: Monkey (Simia sapiens)

Gender: Male

Features: The entity appears to be wearing a doge hat on its head as well as sporting a gold earring on its left ear. It also has a silver chain around its neck and an unusual candy stick in hand. The subject's eyes are unknown.

Personality: SCP-4517 exhibits a deep sense of curiosity and has a fondness for learning strange and unseen subjects. They sometimes engage in trivial conversations and can become surprisingly informative, sharing the rarest facts and unknown information. Despite their playful nature, they are very attentive towards their work and show a great sense of responsibility towards their duties. 

Containment Procedures: SCP-4517 has been placed under constant surveillance to keep any anomalous occurrences from happening. They are to remain within the containment chamber at all times and are strictly prohibited from interacting with anyone outside of their designated work hours. 

Description: SCP-4517 was first discovered within a shopping mall's fast food court. The entity had serviced customers, but their unusual appearance and behavior quickly caught the attention of the public. Several incidents were reported of the entity randomly spouting out inappropriate trivia and mind-bending pieces of knowledge in a way that drove people to avoid and isolate them. Foundation operatives were dispatched to detain and contain it.

SCP-4517 has since been observed causing peculiar happenings that defy conventional logic, from moving items with pseudo-psionic abilities to emitting strange and painful visual and auditory phenomena. Direct contact with humans has been linked to the manifestation of these abilities, which seem to have the capability to alter memories and manipulate individuals. As such, they are strictly advised to be kept under surveillance at all times. 

Conclusion: SCP-4517 appears to have a fascination and obsession for unknown phenomena that goes beyond natural primate curiosity. Though classified as Euclid, it is important to monitor and restrict access to the entity's knowledge-based shenanigans, lest it pose a more significant threat to the Foundation and the general public.
