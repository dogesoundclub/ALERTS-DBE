This human individual is remarkably attuned to the emotions of others, and it can understand and respond to the feelings of others with ease.

Addendum: Item 5593 is to be used as a counselor or therapist as deemed necessary by Foundation personnel. Its unique ability to sense and respond to the moods of others can be used to aid in the treatment of Foundation personnel suffering from psychological distress. However, it is advised that 5593 must always wear its gas mask during sessions to avoid any potential contamination of its patients.
