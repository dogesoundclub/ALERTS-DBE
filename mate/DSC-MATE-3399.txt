Item #: SCP-3399

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3399 is to be confined to a standard chamber outfitted with basic amenities and monitored via surveillance equipment at all times. Access to the chamber is permitted only with Level 2 clearance and requires at least two personnel to accompany the subject.

Description: SCP-3399 appears to be an ordinary human male in his mid-twenties with orange stripes on his skin and blue clown eyes. His head is not arranged green and is adorned with a goggle on his forehead, and he wears a gold earring on his right ear. Additionally, SCP-3399 can be identified by the red scarf around his neck and a candy stick perpetually in his hand.

SCP-3399 also possesses a jovial personality and enjoys making others laugh. He is known for telling humorous stories and doing silly impersonations. Personnel interacting with SCP-3399 have reported that he diffuses tense situations with his humor and lightens the mood in the room. However, it should be noted that SCP-3399's sense of humor can sometimes be inappropriate or off-color.

Despite his friendly nature, SCP-3399 displays no supernatural abilities or anomalous properties. However, his behavior should continue to be monitored to ensure that he does not use his humor to manipulate or deceive Foundation personnel.

Addendum: SCP-3399 was brought to Foundation attention when he was discovered working as a security guard at a local shopping mall. Witnesses reported that he had been entertaining staff and patrons with his humor, which resulted in several security breaches. After being interviewed by Foundation agents, SCP-3399 was taken into custody without incident.
