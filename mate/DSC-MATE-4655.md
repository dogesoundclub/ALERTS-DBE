DSC-MATE-4655 wears a short peak cap on their head, which features a two-color band on their forehead. DSC-MATE-4655 has been reported wearing a gold chain as an accessory around their neck. However, it is unclear if this object holds any anomalous properties.

DSC-MATE-4655 has a deep curiosity about the world and often delves into obscure or unusual topics, leading to spontaneous ramblings of obscure facts or trivia. DSC-MATE-4655 has displayed a remarkable memory and often recalls details about past events with outstanding accuracy. DSC-MATE-4655's curiosity, however, has occasionally led him to gather information about anomalous events or objects in the world, which must be monitored by containment teams.

DSC-MATE-4655 has displayed no aggressive behavior or any unusual psychic powers, but his unusual eyes and personality could make it challenging to integrate fully into the normal human society. DSC-MATE-4655 is cooperative with Foundation staff and has shown no resistance to interviews and monitoring.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, DSC-MATE-4655 reported failure to control his curiosity, which has led to accidental involvement with "anomalous" materials. As a direct result, DSC-MATE-4655 has been restricted to only operating trains on contaminated tracks and conducting interviews with only designated personnel. Further testing is required to determine if DSC-MATE-4655 can maintain control of his curiosity.
