Item #: SCP-8344

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8344 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. It is not to be allowed any form of personal communication with individuals outside of Foundation personnel, and any attempts to do so are to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-8344 is a humanoid male identified as a lawyer. Its most prominent feature is the orange striped pattern on its face. SCP-8344 also possesses blue clown eyes, a purple cap with a headset, a goggle on its forehead, a silver chain, and a gold earring. The subject is always seen wearing a medical mask.

SCP-8344 has a scattered personality and tends to forget details and appointments. Its behavior often leads to humorous situations and difficulties when trying to accomplish tasks. It has a strong desire to communicate with others, which may sometimes lead to it revealing sensitive information, intentionally or unintentionally.

SCP-8344's ability to retain information has yet to be fully assessed, and its capability to remember sensitive information raises security concerns.

Addendum: During a routine check, SCP-8344 had an unanticipated mental episode leading to a complete loss of functioning. SCP-8344 was sedated, and the episode was classified as [DATA EXPUNGED]. It has been recommended that a telepathic investigation of SCP-8344 be carried out.
