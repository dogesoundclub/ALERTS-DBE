Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5876 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. They are allowed to continue their occupation as a beautician, but all clients must be vetted and approved by Foundation personnel prior to appointments.

DSC-MATE-5876's makeup kit and accessories are to be inspected daily for any anomalous properties or alterations. Any unusual or dangerous items found are to be confiscated and tested immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-5876 is a human male with unusual facial features. The subject's face is covered in orange stripes and a cartoonish clown mouth. They have blue clown eyes and wear a medical mask over their mouth.

DSC-MATE-5876's head is that of a normal, blonde-haired male. A two-color band spans across their forehead, and they often wear a silver chain around their neck.

DSC-MATE-5876 possesses a reliable and organized personality, but can be stubborn and have difficulty accepting new ideas or changes in routine. This can lead to humorous situations when unexpected challenges arise.

As a beautician, DSC-MATE-5876 displays mastery of various makeup techniques and trends. However, it is unknown if their anomalous appearance is a result of their profession or if they had anomalous features prior to becoming a beautician.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5876 was discovered after reports of an individual in the area with a "clown-like appearance" received from local authorities. Foundation agents were sent to investigate, and DSC-MATE-5876 was later apprehended without incident.
