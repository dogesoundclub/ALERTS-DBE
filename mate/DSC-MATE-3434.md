Item #: DSC-MATE-3434

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3434 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to DSC-MATE-3434's role as a fast food worker, it is not necessary to restrict its movements outside of the facility, as long as it is accompanied by at least one armed guard.

As DSC-MATE-3434 has shown tendencies towards argumentation, it should only be allowed to interact with personnel trained in non-violent de-escalation techniques.

Description: DSC-MATE-3434 appears to be a male humanoid rabbit, approximately 1.5 meters in height. It possesses green hair, a purple cap, a red victory band on its forehead, jade earring adorned ears, and a red scarf draped over its neck.

DSC-MATE-3434's most notable feature is its frightened mouth, which it constantly maintains regardless of its current emotional state. It carries a whistle at all times, though it has yet to demonstrate its intended use.

Despite its meek appearance, DSC-MATE-3434 has shown a strong analytical and logical aptitude. It often engages in debates and arguments with personnel it interacts with, even in situations where the topic may be trivial or unimportant.

Attempts to determine DSC-MATE-3434's origin have been unsuccessful, as it appears to have no memories prior to appearing in the fast food restaurant where it was discovered.

Addendum: In a recent containment breach, DSC-MATE-3434 managed to escape its containment chamber and engaged in a lengthy debate with DSC-███, citing various logical fallacies in the latter's argument. The breach was eventually resolved through nonviolent means, but DSC-MATE-3434 has since been relocated to a more secure containment chamber.
