Description: Subject 5608 is a female of human species. Their most distinguishing features include their red clown eyes and their illuminated headset. This gives the subject an unnerving appearance, which has made them unpopular with certain Foundation personnel who fear they are not to be trusted.

Subject 5608's personality is often misunderstood by those who don't understand their dry sense of humor. They are not overtly outgoing, but their deadpan jokes often catch those around them off guard. Despite their seemingly casual mannerisms, the subject has proven highly efficient and effective in carrying out their duties as a beautician.

Subject 5608 has been observed to possess a calm, cool and collected demeanor that contrasts sharply with their physical appearance. They have proven to be highly cooperative and adaptable to changes in environment and circumstances.

Addendum: Due to their unique physical appearance, Subject 5608 has been designated for use in undercover operations. Their exceptional abilities as a beautician make them highly sought after for covert operations involving physical disguise. The subject's deadpan humor has also proven useful in diffusing tense situations. However, the subject's loyalty to the Foundation has been called into question on several occasions. Continued monitoring and evaluation of their behavior and demeanor will be necessary to ensure that Subject 5608 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation.
