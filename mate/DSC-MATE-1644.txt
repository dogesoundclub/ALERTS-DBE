Item #: SCP-1644

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1644 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██, with monitoring of all communication and interactions with Foundation personnel. Access to SCP-1644 requires Level 3 clearance or higher.

Description: SCP-1644 is a humanoid of the female gender, whose physical appearance is unremarkable aside from several anomalous features. SCP-1644 is a theater manager by profession and is known for their ambitious and goal-oriented nature. However, their most notable anomalous features are the VR Jade LED eyes and the green Edge Curl head.

SCP-1644's forehead features a goggle that is believed to enhance their strategic thinking and organizational skills. Additionally, they typically wear a gold chain and a gas mask, the latter of which is not anomalous but may be for personal protection.

SCP-1644's personality is, as previously mentioned, ambitious and goal-oriented. This drive sometimes leads them to take on more than they can handle, but they typically manage to pull it off thanks to their strategic thinking and excellent organizational skills.

SCP-1644's anomalous properties have not been extensively tested or categorized, but it is believed that their eyes may provide enhanced perception or data gathering capabilities. Further research is needed to determine the full extent of these capabilities.

Addendum: SCP-1644 has expressed interest in working with the Foundation on certain projects and has been granted dispensation to do so, with appropriate oversight and monitoring. SCP-1644's skills and abilities have proven valuable in several operations, and their cooperation has been greatly appreciated.
