Description: SCP-4758 is a human female displaying multiple anomalous features. Most notably, SCP-4758 possesses orange stripes on their face and purple lips, with blue clown-like eyes. SCP-4758's head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, with a two-colored band on their forehead. They also possess a jade earring, a silver chain, and an LED gas mask-like accessory.

SCP-4758 has displayed a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality, which can at times border on mania.

SCP-4758 has reported working at a local fast-food establishment, with no knowledge of their anomalous nature. Foundation agents were able to interview SCP-4758 under the guise of market research, with amnestics administered upon completion.

Addendum: SCP-4758's LED gas mask is a unique piece of technology, providing varying levels of light and sound. Further study and testing are required to determine its nature and any additional anomalous properties it may possess.
