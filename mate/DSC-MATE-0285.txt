Item #: 285 - Electrician "Electric Tiger"

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 285 must be contained in an electrified cage that contains a power source of no less than 20 volts at all times. Interaction with subject 285 must be limited and done so through a mechanical or electrical system to prevent possible injury.

Description: Subject 285 appears as a male Bengal Tiger with an frightened expression, seen through his mouth. The subject wears a medical mask on his muzzle and dons normal glasses while a pair of goggles sit atop his forehead. He has a single red cross earring on his right ear.

Personality: Although a carnivorous predator by nature, subject 285 has shown to have a creative and artistic side to his personality, which he may express through various hobbies or interests. He finds pleasure in painting, drawing, writing, and other forms of artistic expression. However, due to his unpredictability and primal nature, extreme caution should be taken when interacting with the subject.

Addendum: Subject 285, also known as the "Electric Tiger," has shown a remarkable capability to manipulate and control electricity, revealing it to be his natural affinity. He has proven to be an excellent electrician, capable of running complex electrical systems and creating intricate circuit boards with only his claws. Although this may prove beneficial, we must keep in mind that the subject is still a wild animal, and the containment unit must be reinforced to withstand any potential outbursts of power.
