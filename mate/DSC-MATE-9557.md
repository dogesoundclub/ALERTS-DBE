Item #: DSC-MATE-9557

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9557 is to be kept under constant surveillance by at least two armed guards at all times. Direct communication with the subject is to be avoided whenever possible, and all interactions must be monitored and recorded. In the event that DSC-MATE-9557 attempts to escape or cause harm, all personnel are instructed to use deadly force if necessary.

Description: DSC-MATE-9557 is a humanoid female of apparent human origin. The subject is notable for the presence of spots on their face, which seem to change in number and size depending on its emotional state. DSC-MATE-9557 appears to be entirely human, with no anomalous physical attributes or abilities.

DSC-MATE-9557's most notable feature is its erratic and spontaneous behavior. The subject is prone to taking risks and may engage in impulsive actions without any apparent regard for its own safety or the safety of others. This can lead to sudden and unexpected incidents, such as jumping off cliffs or other high places.

DSC-MATE-9557's current occupation is that of a politician, although the Foundation is unsure of how the subject obtained this position. The subject's political views and affiliations are unknown and require further investigation.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9557 was originally discovered after reports of a woman jumping off a bridge into a river in downtown. The Foundation was able to apprehend the subject without incident, but not before several civilians were injured. The subject's identity was revealed through research into their background and employment history. Further research is required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-9557's anomalous properties and their potential threat to the public.
