Special Containment Procedures: Item 6497 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. No special security measures are necessary, as the subject poses no apparent danger to staff or the general public.

Description: Subject 6497 appears to be a standard human male of Asian descent, approximately 26 years of age. The subject's most notable physical features include a black spot on the upper right corner of the mouth, ski goggle eyes, and a purple cap with a headset. A green cross earring is present in the left ear.

The subject tends to wear a gas mask as an ordinary accessory to their attire. This gas mask does not appear to provide any extra level of protection to the subject and is merely a fashion statement.
