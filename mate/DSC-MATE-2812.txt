Item #: 2812

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2812 is to be allowed to continue her job as a train driver, with the understanding that she is not to divulge any information about her anomalous properties to non-foundation personnel. Personnel are authorized to conduct routine psychological evaluations to monitor for signs of distress or underlying instability.

Description: Subject 2812 is a human female of indeterminate age, with orange stripes present on her face as a result of an unknown and likely paranormal occurrence. She possesses unique features that indicate a predisposition to unusual anomalies, such as rainbow festival headwear and red cross earrings, which appear to be imbued with magical significance. A gold chain worn around her neck is believed to offer additional protection against malign influences.

Furthermore, the subject displays an uncommonly nurturing and almost motherly demeanor, which has led to humorous situations in which she has taken care of friends and family members as if they were her own children. This trait could be linked to her background or upbringing, though further research is needed to corroborate this hypothesis.

Despite her unusual appearance and genetic makeup, the subject is of normal intelligence and presents no obvious physical abnormalities. She has not exhibited any signs of malice towards foundation personnel or the general public and should be considered low-risk.

Addendum: Subject 2812 has recently requested a change in duties, indicating that she wishes to take a role in the foundation's paranormal outreach program. This request is under review, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the safety of all involved parties.
