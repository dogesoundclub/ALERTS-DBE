Item #: 6219

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6219 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-19. Any requests made by SCP-6219 for hair or nail care must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel. Any interactions with SCP-6219 must be monitored to prevent unauthorized disclosure of anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-6219 is a human female of average height and build with orange stripes on their face, a red lip, and normal glasses for eyes. SCP-6219's head is a metal blue color, and they wear gold earrings and a gold chain as accessories, along with a normal gas mask.

SCP-6219 appears to have the ability to compel those around them to laugh uncontrollably at any joke or humorous situation that they present. SCP-6219 is also highly social and outgoing, often seeking attention and engaging in lively conversations with others.

SCP-6219 works as a beautician and has shown a particular skill in hair and nail care. However, they require constant monitoring and restrictions on their use of anomalous abilities during these interactions.

SCP-6219's anomalous abilities have been observed to affect individuals up to 10 meters away, making it crucial to prevent exposure to a larger audience.

Addendum: SCP-6219 has expressed interest in performing their services on other humanoid SCPs, but all requests have been denied due to potential security risks. Further research is needed to fully understand the limits and implications of SCP-6219's ability.
