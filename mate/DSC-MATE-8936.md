Item #: 8936

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8936 is to be contained in a specially-equipped habitat designed to resemble a bustling city environment, furnished with simulated buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure that replicates urban zones. This environment is to provide enough space and stimulation for the specimen to thrive and fulfill its natural desires. Access to the habitat requires clearance of Level 2 or above, and no unauthorized personnel are allowed unless escorted by a senior researcher.

Description: Subject 8936 is a male monkey of the species unknown, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height when fully erect. Its most distinctive feature is a pair of large, red clown eyes, which glow brightly in low-light conditions. The subject's head is covered with normal black hair, and it wears a pair of goggles on its forehead at all times. The goggles are of unknown origin and composition, but they appear to grant the subject enhanced visual acuity and night-vision capabilities.

Subject 8936's ears are adorned with a single jade earring of unknown value or origin. The subject is also frequently seen wearing a gold chain around its neck and smoking a cigarette. The source of the cigarette is unknown, but it appears to be a manifestation of the subject's innate abilities, as it produces no smoke or ash and does not require ignition.

The subject's personality is characterized by a laid-back and easy-going demeanor, though it can become fiercely protective of its loved ones at a moment's notice. Despite its primarily playful nature, the subject has shown a remarkable aptitude for firefighting and rescue operations. Its physical capabilities are enhanced beyond those of ordinary primates, and it has shown remarkable endurance and agility in both simulated and real-life emergency scenarios.

Special Note: Subject 8936 is not to be underestimated or trifled with, as attempts to do so have led to unexpected and often dangerous consequences. All personnel are advised to treat the subject with caution and respect, and to avoid any behavior that could provoke its aggressive tendencies. Engagement with the subject should be limited solely to scientific observation and research purposes.
