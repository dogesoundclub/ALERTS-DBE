Item #: SCP-4108

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4108 is to be housed in a specially designed enclosure at Site-██. Access to this enclosure is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. In order to prevent SCP-4108 from accessing its anomalous abilities, it must be provided with regular physical and mental stimulation. SCP-4108 must be provided with a variety of toys and puzzles to keep its mind occupied during periods of inactivity. Additionally, personnel assigned to SCP-4108 are encouraged to interact with it as much as possible.

Description: SCP-4108 is a humanoid creature resembling a monkey, approximately 1.2 meters in height. SCP-4108 possesses shade glasses and oftentimes dons a blue bandana around his head. It was discovered working as a police officer in downtown ████████. SCP-4108's anomalous abilities manifest as a heightened sense of intuition, allowing it to predict or sense future events.

SCP-4108 is often seen carrying a candy stick, which it appears to use as a comfort object or a stress reliever. SCP-4108 displays a generally cheerful and friendly personality but may become irritated or agitated when its abilities are called into question.

SCP-4108's abilities have been tested in controlled environments, and it has been determined that its predictions are accurate up to 90% of the time. Efforts to understand the mechanism behind SCP-4108's abilities are ongoing.

Addendum 4108-01: On ██/██/20██, SCP-4108 predicted an imminent bombing in downtown ████████. Its prediction was disregarded by the local authorities, leading to 17 deaths and several injuries. SCP-4108 was later retrieved by Foundation personnel and secured at Site-██. This incident highlights the importance of taking SCP-4108's predictions seriously and underscores the need for increased collaboration between local law enforcement and the SCP Foundation.
