Special Containment Procedures: Dr. 4675 is to be contained in a secure, soundproofed room for her own safety and for the safety of others. Access to her is strictly limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Dr. 4675 is to be provided with books, educational materials, and any other research material she may request. Cognitive behavioral therapy is to be administered regularly to keep Dr. 4675's motivations healthy.

Description: Dr. 4675 appears to be a female human with blue clown eyes, spots on her face, and a two-color band on her forehead. She is often seen wearing a medical mask to cover her mouth, and a silver chain necklace. She has a small jade earring on one of her ears.

Personality: Dr. 4675 is an intelligent individual with a strong hunger for knowledge. She has a passion for reading and researching obscure topics and collecting educational materials. She is enthusiastic about sharing her newfound knowledge with others, no matter how esoteric the subject. 

Dr. 4675 shows signs of excessive conduct when it comes to learning and education, pushing her to explore dubious sources to acquire information. She may become obsessive or agitated when denied access to research material or experiments. Dr. 4675 is cooperative with Foundation staff but may become emotional when her experimentation is interrupted or stopped, which could have severe consequences for containment. 

A containment precaution must be taken to avoid exposure to any prescriptive or suggestive material in Dr. 4675's vicinity, as any material of this nature may lead to negative results. Researchers should exercise caution when deploying personnel for Dr. 4675's research or tasks. Trust must be established slowly and verified continually to avoid any accidental leakage of sensitive data on Foundation security, incidents, or anomalies.
