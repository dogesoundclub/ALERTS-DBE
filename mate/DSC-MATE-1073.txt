Item #: SCP-1073

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1073 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be furnished with basic medical equipment suitable for veterinary purposes. A supply of cigarettes should be provided to the subject, but smoking is not permitted within the containment chamber.

Description: SCP-1073 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, standing at approximately one meter in height. The subject's most distinctive feature is its frightened mouth, which it maintains often even when not exhibiting signs of fear. SCP-1073's eyes are obscured by horned rim glasses, and it wears a purple cap with green hair. The subject has elongated, jade-colored earrings in both ears and is frequently seen smoking cigarettes.

SCP-1073 is a veterinarian by profession and seems to take this role seriously, tending to the healthcare of both humans and animals in its vicinity. However, SCP-1073 also demonstrates a tendency to fix things in unconventional ways. Despite the apparent lack of resources in its containment chamber, the subject has managed to cobble together makeshift solutions for various problems it has encountered.

SCP-1073's hands-on approach to problem-solving can make it difficult to predict its actions or reactions in certain situations. Its unconventional methods and disregard for protocol make it a potential liability that must be carefully monitored. Nevertheless, its expertise in veterinary care may prove beneficial in certain research projects or field operations.

Addendum: SCP-1073 has requested a supply of duct tape and paper clips to be added to its containment chamber. Permission is pending review by senior research staff.
