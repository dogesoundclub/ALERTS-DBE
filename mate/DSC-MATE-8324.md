Item #: 8324

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 8324 is to be kept in a secure, padded enclosure with a temperature no higher than 65Â°F. Access to Item 8324 is allowed only with Level 3 clearance and accompanied by two armed guards. In addition, all electronic devices must be switched off while interacting with Item 8324 to prevent any potential interference.

Description: Item 8324 is a male rabbit that stands approximately 2ft tall. Its physical features appear to be of the common fluffy bunny aside from the unusual LED eyes that shift in color to form rainbows. Item 8324 wears a purple cap and a headset, which it can communicate through a language understood only by certain individuals. Its ears are pierced with a jade earring and is seen sporting a silver chain and a whistle as accessories. Although Item 8324 appears to be placid, it is highly intelligent and enjoys brainstorming unique solutions to problems, sometimes leading to ludicrous ideas.

Positive interactions between Item 8324 and Foundation staff reveal a highly cooperative, elucidative individual that views the electrical problems presented to it as puzzles to solve. However, it is highly inquisitive and has attempted to gain unauthorized access to various Foundation electronic devices, compelling us to have its enclosure fitted with electromagnetically shielded walls.

Addendum: In light of the most recent battery of tests, Item 8324 is being considered for transfer to Site-19 to assist with electrical maintenance tasks.
