SCP Foundation Item #: 650

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Officer 650 must maintain daily communication with their assigned therapist to monitor their emotions and ensure that they remain stable. They are only allowed to interact with humanoid SCPs if necessary while wearing a medical mask. Officer 650 is authorized to carry and use standard-issue weapons in the field.

Description: Officer 650 is a male human police officer, approximately 35 years old. His face features a prominent frightened mouth that often gives the impression that he is worried or fearful. He is commonly seen wearing a doge hat as a form of stress relief. His medical mask is worn not only for protection, but also as a way to hide facial expressions that could indicate his emotional state.

Officer 650 is highly empathetic and possesses a strong nurturing instinct. He often treats his friends and family members as if they were his own children, which can lead to humorous situations when he acts overprotective or overly caring. However, this personality trait can also make him susceptible to emotional distress when faced with situations that involve danger or harm to others.

Due to his caring nature and empathetic abilities, Officer 650 has shown great success in interacting with humanoid SCPs where others have failed. However, to prevent potential emotional attachment to SCPs, Officer 650's interactions with them must be monitored and limited.

Addendum: Officer 650 has expressed willingness to undergo additional training to better manage his empathetic abilities and emotions in the field. This request is currently under review by Foundation personnel.
