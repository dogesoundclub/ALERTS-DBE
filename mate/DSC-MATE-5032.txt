Item #: 5032
Classification: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5032 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-███. The subject is to be provided with regular psychological evaluations to monitor for any abnormal behavior/conduct. Access to SCP-5032 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-5032 is a human male of average height and build, with orange stripes on his face and a visibly frightened mouth. The subject's eyes are obsidian black and resemble ski goggles, and wearing a doge hat over his head. SCP-5032 also has gold earrings on his ears and is commonly seen wearing a gold chain and holding a candy stick.

SCP-5032 possesses a strong sense of intuition which may appear to be psychic in nature, allowing it to anticipate events before they occur and sense the emotional state of those around it. This ability has been documented to consistently occur in controlled experimentation. SCP-5032 has expressed discomfort with its abilities and is highly cooperative with research staff in understanding the capabilities of its supernatural ability.

SCP-5032 is employed as a medical doctor within Site-███, providing exceptional care to Foundation personnel. SCP-5032's special ability may be an asset in providing advanced and accelerated diagnoses—which could lead to significant benefits in saving lives and limiting outbreaks.

Addendum: SCP-5032's sense of humor has been noted in interactions with Foundation personnel. He has been observed to frequently make jokes and reference popular culture. While SCP-5032's humor is welcomed, it does show a possible lack of maturity in performing his duties, and clinical staff should take care to ensure proper protocol is followed.
