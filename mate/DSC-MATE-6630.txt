Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6630 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber is to be equipped with a number of toys and games designed to prevent boredom and promote mental stimulus. SCP-6630 is to be provided with a suitably sized cage for sleeping and basking.

No interaction between SCP-6630 and other SCPs or personnel is permitted without explicit authorization from two level 4 personnel or Site Director.

Description: SCP-6630 appears as a rabbit with blue clown eyes. It possesses a purple cap with a headset, has a goggle on its forehead, wears a gold earring and is frequently seen carrying a candy stick.

SCP-6630 is a sentient being capable of speech and, despite its appearance, is highly intelligent. SCP-6630 works as a firefighter and has a tendency to be impulsive, often acting on its emotions rather than thinking things through. This has the potential to lead to some humorous situations, such as making spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising.

Despite its tendency towards impulsivity, SCP-6630 is known for being a highly skilled firefighter. Its small size and agility make it ideal for navigating through tight spaces, and its quick reflexes have saved numerous lives over the course of its career.

SCP-6630 has displayed no anomalous properties beyond its highly evolved intelligence and the apparent ability to communicate in fluent English.

Addendum: SCP-6630 has expressed an interest in breeding with Foundation personnel on several occasions. All such requests have been denied.
