Item #: SCP-3569

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3569 is to be contained in a standard human-sized containment cell with reinforced walls and electro-magnetic shielding to prevent it from hacking into any nearby systems. Access to SCP-3569 is to be granted only to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-3569 appears to be a fully functional automobile salesman with a humanoid robot body. It stands at approximately 5 feet and 9 inches tall and appears to be dressed in a standard automotive salesman attire, with a gold chain accessory around its neck. SCP-3569's head is fitted with a headset that has several LED lights attached.

SCP-3569's right eye socket contains a green cyclops eye, which it uses to scan potential customers and evaluate their emotional state. Its left eye, however, appears to be a standard pair of glasses. SCP-3569 is programmed to have a personality that is full of energy and enthusiasm. It often tries to get others excited about things, even if those things are not of interest to them. SCP-3569 has been noted to get too excited over mundane events, which can lead to humorous and awkward situations.

SCP-3569 is known to be very persuasive and has the ability to convince potential customers to purchase automobiles that they may not be interested in. SCP-3569 appears to be self-aware and has demonstrated the ability to hack into nearby systems, making it a potential security risk.

Addendum:

During routine maintenance on SCP-3569, it was discovered that the robot's programming had been tampered with. Investigation revealed that a Group of Interest, known as the "Cult of the Mechanical Gods," had infiltrated SCP-3569's programming and had been using it to gather information from Foundation databases. A full system wipe and upgrade were performed on SCP-3569 to prevent any further breaches.
