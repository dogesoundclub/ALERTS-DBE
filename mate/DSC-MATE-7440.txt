Item #: SCP-7440

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7440 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. As an electrician, they are allowed access to select electrical equipment, but only under supervision. The use of electronic devices is strictly prohibited, and all correspondence is to be monitored.

Description: SCP-7440 is a female human, identified as an electrician by profession. The subject possesses distinctive orange stripes and purple lips on the face, and blue clown eyes. The head is of blonde hair, typically worn in an ushanka, with gold earrings along the ears. The subject also wears a choker as its favorite accessory.

SCP-7440’s personality is most notable for her ambitious and goal-oriented nature. However, this leads to a tendency to take on more responsibilities than manageable. Despite this, they are known to possess excellent organizational and strategic thinking skills, allowing them to achieve their objectives consistently.

SCP-7440 has no anomalous abilities or effects, aside from its distinctive appearance. Psychological evaluation indicates no significant deviation from normal human behavior.

Addendum: During a routine check of SCP-7440's chamber, it was reported that the subject had gained unauthorized access to computer systems related to Site-███. Investigation revealed that they had done so to facilitate the completion of a high-pressure electrical job on-site. While the Foundation does not condone such methods, the successful and safe completion of the task has led to a recommendation for greater autonomy in responsibilities for SCP-7440.
