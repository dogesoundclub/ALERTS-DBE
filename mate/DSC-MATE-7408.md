Description: DSC 7408 appears to be a male rabbit of unknown origin. Despite his small stature, DSC 7408 is notorious for being a powerful and ruthless Mafia Boss. His facial features include a frightened mouth, which usually expresses fear or anxiety. DSC 7408 wears a blue bandana on his head and a golden earring on his left ear. He also wears a red scarf and smokes a cigarette most of the time.

DSC 7408's personality is a unique contrast to his profession. He is known to be empathetic and compassionate towards others, but this often leads to him taking on other people's problems as his own. He feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around him, which can be both admirable and exhausting. Despite his reputation as a mafia boss, DSC 7408 harbors a soft spot for the helpless and downtrodden. This has led to some speculation that DSC 7408 may have a history of criminality rooted in a desire to protect and provide for his community.

Addendum: DSC 7408's eyes are unknown due to his preference for wearing sunglasses at all times. Attempts to remove DSC 7408's sunglasses have been met with extreme resistance, suggesting the possible presence of anomalous properties. More research is needed to ascertain the full extent of DSC 7408's abilities and to more accurately assess the threat he may pose to Foundation personnel.
