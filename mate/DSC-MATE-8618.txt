Item #: SCP-8618

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8618 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a reinforced reinforced titanium door and ventilation system capable of filtering airborne toxins. Containment personnel must wear Level-A protective suits when entering SCP-8618's chamber due to the presence of its accessory.

Description: SCP-8618 is a male human identified as a veterinarian by profession. The entity stands approximately 1.8 meters tall and has a normal build for a human male. SCP-8618's most notable features are a dark spot on the lower right side of its mouth and a constant smile on its face. The entity's eyes resemble ski goggles with LED lights around the rims.

SCP-8618's personality is noted to be impulsive and reckless, displaying a tendency to act before thinking through situations. This trait produces humorous incidents such as minor accidents or mishaps while trying to showcase its abilities to impress others. SCP-8618 has no evident anomalous abilities other than its suit limiting direct interaction with the entity.

Addendum: SCP-8618's LED gas mask accessory has been determined to be an additional anomalous artifact related to the object. The gas mask, when worn, projects an aura of unpredictable behavior causing individuals to behave similarly to SCP-8618's recklessness. Further research into the origins and purpose of the mask is necessary.
