Item #: 476

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As an intelligent, sentient being, 476 is not to be contained physically, but instead monitored closely by undercover agents to ensure that his criminal activities do not escalate to the point of causing harm to the general public.

Description: 476 is a large, male Siberian Tiger standing at around 7 feet tall when standing upright. He is easily identifiable through his police cap and normal glasses that he wears to conceal his identity while conducting business. Despite his fearsome appearance, his mouth often holds a look of fear and trepidation.

Personality: Despite his intimidating appearance, 476 is fiercely loyal to the Mafia family he leads and possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This trait often results in him attempting to take on more than he can handle, leading to humorous situations where he is unable to fit all his tasks into a single day or tries to carry too many things at once. However, this also means that he is highly disciplined and efficient in his dealings.

Although 476 is known to be violent when necessary, he prefers to conduct his business in a more subtle manner, using his intelligence and cunning to outmaneuver his opponents. He has been observed to possess a quick wit and a sharp tongue that he uses to negotiate deals and intimidate those who dare to cross him.

In conclusion, while it's impossible to overlook 476's criminal activities, it's best to keep him in check through close monitoring and to avoid provoking him or his organization unnecessarily.
