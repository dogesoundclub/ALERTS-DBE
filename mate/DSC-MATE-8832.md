Item #: 8832

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The entity known as 8832 is to be allowed to continue functioning within its current job as a car salesman. Its living quarters are to be a standard-sized domicile with all necessary amenities. Standard park fencing will be erected around its quarters to ensure its safety, and a special diet of meat products and candy sticks is to be provided. Any unforeseen incidents are to be reported to the site supervisor immediately.

Description: 8832 appears to be a member of the tiger species, standing at roughly 6'5". Although its physical traits are typical of the species, 8832 possesses a number of distinguishing features that set it apart from others of its kind. Its eyes are protected by a pair of normal glasses, and its head is adorned by a bucket hat. On its forehead is a dual-color band, and a red cross earring is evident on each of its ears. It also carries a gold chain around its neck and, curiously enough, a candy stick as a frequent accessory.

Personality: 8832 is a highly inquisitive entity with a fondness for collecting and sharing information. It demonstrates an unending curiosity for unique and odd information, which prompts it to share its newly learned facts with others. Despite its tendencies to occasionally distract individuals with obscure or trivial information, in general, 8832 is known to be friendly and eloquent, making it a tricky salesperson to resist.

Additional Notes: 8832 has been observed to speak in common language despite evidence of a highly unusual accent. It is considered highly skilled and persuasive in the art of sales flattery. However, it has demonstrated an unusual predilection for candy sticks which seem to exacerbate its chattiness trait. As such, candy stick supply should be monitored for potential overindulgence.
