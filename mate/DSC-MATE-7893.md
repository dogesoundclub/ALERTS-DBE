Description: Subject 7893 appears to be a human male in his early thirties, standing at 5'11" and weighing approximately 175 pounds. His most notable feature is a set of orange stripes on his face that appear to change in pattern and intensity depending on his emotional state. He also sports red clown eyes, which he claims are due to a medical condition. His head is not arranged in a conventional manner â€“ his hair and facial hair are unkempt and grow in thick, unorganized patches. He often wears a medical mask over his mouth, which he claims is to prevent the spread of germs.

The subject displays a cheerful and friendly demeanor, often smiling and cracking jokes with those around him. He claims to be a farmer and expresses a strong desire to make the world a better place, which he attempts to do by running his farm in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. He has been known to protest or boycott companies or causes he feels are unethical, sometimes in a humorous fashion.

Subject 7893's anomalous abilities are not fully understood, but it has been observed that his emotions can have a physical effect on his surroundings. At times of extreme joy or anger, his orange stripes have been known to glow and produce a calming effect on those nearby. In instances of fear or anxiety, the stripes have been observed to vibrate and produce a sense of unease. The subject claims to have no control over these abilities and is actively seeking to understand and better control them.

Addendum: Subject 7893 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and has expressed a desire to learn more about his condition and potential abilities. Further testing and observation is ongoing.
