Special Containment Procedures: Item 2809 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. The subject is currently employed as a reporter for [REDACTED] and is to be monitored for any signs of anomalous behavior.

Description: Item 2809 is a human male with a normal blonde head and ski goggle eyes. The subject is often seen with a cigarette, and has a distinctive smile. Item 2809 has a strong sense of independence and may be resistant to authority or rules that they see as unnecessary. This can lead to some rebellious behavior, such as sneaking out of the office early or taking a day off without permission.

The subject's anomalous properties manifest in their ability to uncover information and secrets that would otherwise remain hidden. Item 2809 is known to have a talent for investigative journalism, and is able to penetrate even the most tightly guarded organizations. It is believed that this ability is related to the subject's resistance to authority and their willingness to take risks.

Addendum: Item 2809's anomalous properties have been noted by several groups, both within and outside of the Foundation. Attempts to recruit the subject have thus far been unsuccessful. It is recommended that further efforts be made to secure Item 2809 for Foundation use.
