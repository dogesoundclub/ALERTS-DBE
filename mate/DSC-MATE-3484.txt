The subject is to be provided with a daily diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as a candy stick for emotional support.

Communication with Subject 3484 must be limited to verbal exchanges and must be conducted by a female staff member, as the subject has demonstrated a tendency to become aggressive towards male personnel.

Description: Subject 3484 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, commonly known as the long-tailed macaque. The subject stands at 40 centimeters in height and weighs approximately 5 kilograms. The monkey has blue clown eyes, a purple cap with a headset, and a pair of goggles on its forehead. The monkey's mouth is in a constant state of fear and it exhibits a 2-color band on its forehead.

Subject 3484 works as a beautician and often tries to take on more tasks than it can handle. Its strong sense of duty and responsibility has led to it being unable to fit all of its tasks into a single day, resulting in humorous situations.

The monkey has been observed to display high levels of intelligence and has demonstrated the ability to understand complex tasks. However, it displays erratic and unpredictable behavior, often becoming aggressive towards those it perceives as a threat to its duties.

Addendum: Subject 3484 is a valued member of our staff, providing us with an occasional laugh and a fresh haircut. While it may appear intimidating at times, it has shown a great deal of loyalty and dedication to its work, which in turn has garnered respect from its team.
