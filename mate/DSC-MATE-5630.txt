Special Containment Procedures: Item 5630 is to be kept in a padded containment unit at all times, with food and water provided every 12 hours. Any personnel coming in contact with Item 5630 must undergo a thorough medical examination and wear protective gear at all times.

Description: Item 5630 is a male rabbit of an unknown species, measuring approximately 30 cm in length and weighing approximately 1.8 kg. Item 5630 is notable for its frightened mouth, horned rim glasses, retro cap, goggle on its forehead, and its red scarf. Item 5630's personality is described as valuing harmony and social connections, but it also has a goofy side which can lead to humorous interactions with others.

Item 5630's anomalous properties manifest in its ability to communicate with humans through a form of telepathy. Item 5630 is also capable of rapid movement, being able to run up to 45 mph for extended periods. This rapid movement has been observed to be accompanied by a trail of multicolored sparks.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, Item 5630 managed to escape from its containment unit by burrowing through the padding. Item 5630 was located in a nearby residential area, causing chaos by attempting to deliver random packages to anyone it encountered. Item 5630 was eventually recovered by Foundation personnel using a specially designed net launcher. As a result of this incident, all containment units for Item 5630 and other similar anomalies have been upgraded and reinforced.
