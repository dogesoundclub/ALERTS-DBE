Description: 1746 appears to be a humanoid female of the species, Homo sapiens. The subject possesses facial spots and a frequently displayed smile, and is usually seen wearing medical attire as well as a purple cap equipped with a headset.

1746 displays a typical human physical composition, with the added features of a two-color band on the forehead and a golden earring on each ear. The subject's eyes, while seen in normal glasses, do not appear to have any anomalous properties. Additionally, a choker is often seen worn around the subject's neck.

1746 displays notable personality traits such as being detail-oriented and displaying habits akin to obsessive-compulsive behavior. The subject often alphabetizes mundane objects or color-codes clothing in their closet. However, 1746 appears to have no control over this behavior and is observed to become anxious or distressed without the presence of their usual routines.

Addendum: Subject 1746 has proven to be a valuable asset to the site, with their background in medical sciences and attention to detail contributing greatly to several successful containment operations. However, the subject's behavior must continue to be monitored, as the potential psychological effects of their compulsions may still cause disruptions in daily operations.
