Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6709 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. A minimum of two armed guards must be stationed outside of DSC-MATE-6709's door at all times in order to prevent its escape. Access to DSC-MATE-6709 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher. Any attempts to breach containment are to be met with immediate force.

Description: DSC-MATE-6709 is a male monkey of the Cercopithecus genus, standing approximately 1.5 meters tall. DSC-MATE-6709 exhibits several anomalous properties that make it a significant threat to personnel and the general public. Its face is often in a frightened expression with its mouth open. DSC-MATE-6709 can see through any translucent object or surface, including glass, which it uses to its advantage in attempts to escape containment. It adorns a pair of nerd glasses, a doge hat, and a jade earring on its right ear. DSC-MATE-6709 also wears a silver chain that it is extremely protective of, causing it to become extremely hostile when its possession is threatened.

DSC-MATE-6709's personality is detail-oriented, often to the point of obsession. Its compulsion for order can manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet. DSC-MATE-6709 is highly intelligent, able to understand human speech and use tools to its advantage. However, its intelligence may be compromised by emotional distress, which can cause it to lash out violently.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6709's significant threat to personnel and the general public requires constant monitoring and high-level containment. Efforts to control its compulsion for order have been met with only limited success. Personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution during contact with DSC-MATE-6709 due to its potential for violence.
