Item #: 8562

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8562 has been contained within a secure laboratory at Site-██. Due to its robotic nature, the subject must be periodically serviced and maintained to ensure optimal functionality. Subject 8562 is to be equipped with a GPS tracker at all times in case of unexpected movement or breaches. Any requests for use or consultation with 8562 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Subject 8562 appears to be a robotic humanoid, roughly six feet tall. Its main body is a sleek metallic frame, with limbs that end in supple, flexible pincers. Its spherical head, which resembles a bucket hat, houses a complex processor which powers its artificial intelligence capabilities. The head is also attached to a neck joint that allows it to swivel and tilt with precision.

One of 8562's primary accessories is a small, silver whistle that it keeps in a compartment built into its chest plate. The whistle is only to be used in case of emergency or as a part of veterinarian procedures. Subject 8562's programming allows it to analyze and diagnose animal illnesses and injuries, as well as administer treatments (including surgeries) with utmost precision and efficiency.

Despite its inorganic composition, 8562 shows a capacity for a wide range of emotions and expressions. In particular, it appears to have a strong streak of idealism and a desire to "do good" for living creatures. This has led to noteworthy events - such as 8562 joining protests against animal cruelty or environmental destruction - which have been monitored by Foundation operatives for both safety reasons and information-gathering purposes. While these actions could be seen as humorous or strange coming from a robot, they have not detracted from 8562's primary function as a veterinary specialist.

Addendum: During a routine maintenance check in 20██, technicians discovered that one of 8562's internal processors had been tampered with by an unknown source. The processor controls a portion of 8562's learning capabilities and ethical decision-making processes. As such, 8562 was briefly decommissioned pending a full analysis. Investigation to determine the responsible party is ongoing.
