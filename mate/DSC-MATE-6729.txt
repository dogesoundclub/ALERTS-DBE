Item #: SCP-6729

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6729 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit furnished with a bed, writing desk, and other basic amenities. It is to be given access to traffic control equipment, such as traffic cones and reflective vests, as well as any other items necessary for carrying out its duties as a traffic officer. Any requests made by SCP-6729 for additional equipment or personal items will be reviewed by Site personnel and approved on a case-by-case basis.

SCP-6729 is to be allowed to work as a traffic officer in designated areas under the supervision of Foundation personnel. It is to wear its standard uniform, including a hoodie featuring a 2 color band on the forehead, a silver chain, and an LED gas mask. SCP-6729 is to maintain a professional demeanor at all times and follow traffic control procedures as outlined by local law enforcement.

Description: SCP-6729 is a human male with red clown eyes. It stands at 1.75 meters tall and weighs approximately 70 kg. SCP-6729 is equipped with the personality trait of strong independence and a tendency to refuse help even when it is needed. This could result in some amusing situations such as attempting to lift a heavy object without assistance or refusing to use a map when lost.

SCP-6729 works as a traffic officer in the city of [REDACTED]. It is proficient in traffic control procedures and has been observed to use the equipment provided to it with a high degree of competency. It has shown a preference for working alone and has frequently declined opportunities for team assignments.

SCP-6729's origins and the cause of its anomalous characteristics are currently unknown. Attempts to interview SCP-6729 about its background have been met with limited success as it prefers to keep its personal life private.

Addendum: Following an incident where SCP-6729 refused to seek medical attention for a minor injury sustained on the job, a mandatory psychological evaluation was ordered. The evaluation revealed that SCP-6729 has a deep-seated fear of being seen as weak and a reluctance to be seen as a burden on others. Site personnel are advised to approach SCP-6729 with sensitivity and offer support where necessary.
