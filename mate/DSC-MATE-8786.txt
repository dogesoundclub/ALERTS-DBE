SCP-8786 is a humanoid entity designated as a fashion designer with a tendency towards risk-taking behavior. Her physical appearance is notable for her blue clown eyes, set into a face that frequently exhibits a wide, sunny smile. Her hair is styled into two high pigtails, each wrapped in a two-color band that complements the rest of her ensemble. To further add to her sense of style, SCP-8786 also wears a pair of gold earrings and a silver chain.

It is important to note that despite her seemingly carefree personality, SCP-8786 is not to be underestimated. Her impulsive behavior has led to a number of dangerous situations, including jumping off cliffs or into rivers on a whim. Those that encounter her in the field should take care to keep a close eye on her movements, as she may spontaneously decide to pursue a reckless course of action. Despite her occasional lapses in judgement, SCP-8786 has repeatedly proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation through the creation of anomalous clothing items, which have been utilized in a variety of operations.
