SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-1731

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1731 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a specialized ventilation system to accommodate the environmental needs of SCP-1731, and a surveillance system to monitor its movements at all times.

SCP-1731 is to be fed a diet consisting of fruits and vegetables twice a day. Cleaning personnel are advised to exercise caution when entering SCP-1731's chamber, as it has a tendency to become agitated if its living space is disturbed.

Description: SCP-1731 appears to be a male monkey, standing at approximately 0.6 meters in height. It wears a purple cap with a headset and a red scarf around its neck. Its mouth is in a continual expression of fear and its eyes appear as if they are ski goggles. SCP-1731 displays intelligence consistent with its species, but its behavior is atypical and unpredictable.

SCP-1731 has displayed a great sense of organization in its behavior, which can be considered a form of control. It will delegate tasks to other individuals, including Foundation personnel, in a very matter-of-fact manner. However, its methods can come across as humorous since it tends to take charge of group events and group projects.

SCP-1731 is capable of basic communication with humans, and appears to understand the English language. It will often attempt to engage in conversations with staff members, displaying a curious personality. Due to its unpredictable behavior, all interactions with SCP-1731 are to be supervised by at least two armed guards.

Addendum: SCP-1731 has been observed exhibiting anomalous properties that require further investigation. Research teams have been authorized to conduct experiments to better understand these properties. Any findings are to be reported immediately to Site Director.
