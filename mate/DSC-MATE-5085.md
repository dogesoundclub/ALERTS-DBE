Item #: DSC-MATE-5085

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5085 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the chamber must be granted only by Level 3 personnel. Daily check-ins with DSC-MATE-5085 are recommended to ensure its mental state remains stable. All staff must not display any emotional distress when in proximity to DSC-MATE-5085 as its empathic abilities may become unpredictably activated.

Description: DSC-MATE-5085 is a male tiger anthropomorph, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. It wears a "Doge" hat on its head and has a 2 color band on its forehead with a Red Cross earring adorning each ear. DSC-MATE-5085 is often seen wearing a gold chain and smoking a cigarette in its humanoid configuration.

DSC-MATE-5085 has the ability to sense and project emotions onto others. Its exceptional empathic abilities have led to frequently humorous situations in which it can help others improve their moods or find humor in difficult circumstances.

DSC-MATE-5085's employment as a fast-food worker is a means of blending in with human society but has no significant correlation to its anomalous abilities. DSC-MATE-5085 is cooperative and does not pose a significant threat to Foundation security, and therefore has been granted Safe object classification.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5085 has requested to have a television installed in its containment chamber, citing his "need to stay in touch with the outside world" and "stay up to date on the latest anime releases." After research into the request, it has been approved by Level 3 personnel.
