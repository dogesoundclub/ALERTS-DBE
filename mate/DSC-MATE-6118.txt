Item #: SCP-6118

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6118 is to be kept in a standard human containment chamber with adequate space for movement. A supply of raw meat is to be provided to SCP-6118 daily, and any evidence of mistreatment or negligence will result in disciplinary action. Conversations with SCP-6118 are to be monitored, and any mention of its non-human nature should be discouraged.

Description: SCP-6118 appears as a male tiger with a frightened mouth, often seen wearing a hoodie, and accessorizes with a gold chain and a candy stick. SCP-6118 is highly skilled at selling cars and is capable of charming even the most skeptical customers, often leading to immediate purchases.

SCP-6118's personality is notably laid-back and easy-going, seemingly at odds with its ferocious appearance. This belies a fierce loyalty and protectiveness of its loved ones. SCP-6118 has been observed engaging in heated arguments with those who insult its friends or family members, often leading to humorous situations.

SCP-6118's origins remain unknown, with no records of a tiger being born or raised in the area in which it was discovered. SCP-6118 was initially discovered after several reports of a car salesman exhibiting tiger-like behavior surfaced.

Addendum: SCP-6118 has expressed an interest in learning how to drive, a request that is currently under review by Site Director █████████.
