Secure Containment Procedures: Due to its unusual characteristics, SCP-3070 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any attempts to move or relocate SCP-3070 must be authorized by at least two Level-4 personnel.

Description: SCP-3070 is a male rabbit with nerd glasses for eyes and a hoodie for its head. Additional features include a two-color band on its forehead and a red scarf around its neck. SCP-3070 can usually be found carrying a candy stick as it goes about its duties as a traffic officer.

Personality: SCP-3070 is a highly observant individual, noting even the smallest of details. Its gift-giving ability is exceptional, often matching the receiver's tastes and preferences to the perfect gift. However, SCP-3070 can also become overly concerned with gift-giving, often spending hours agonizing over a present that possesses no discernible flaws.

SCP-3070's job as a traffic officer has shown to be beneficial to Foundation operations. The creature displays a remarkable ability to maintain order among the masses and prevent chaos, which has resulted in increased success rates in Foundation missions involving large crowds. SCP-3070 displays no hostility towards humans or SCPs, though it has an intense dislike for rodents and canines.

Addendum: During testing, it was discovered that SCP-3070's candy stick, when consumed by human subjects, induces a mild euphoric state, improving mood and cognitive function. Further research into the ingredients of the candy stick is ongoing.
