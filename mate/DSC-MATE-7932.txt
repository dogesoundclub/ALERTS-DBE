Item #: SCP-7932

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7932 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with additional accommodations for its species. The chamber is to be outfitted with a soundproofing system to prevent SCP-7932 from overhearing conversations or news reports regarding traumatic events. SCP-7932 is provided with a daily ration of its preferred candy sticks as a reward for its cooperation with Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-7932 appears to be a male rabbit, measuring approximately 90 cm in height when standing on its hind legs. Its fur is a vibrant shade of green, which does not appear to be the result of dye or other artificial methods. SCP-7932's most prominent physical features are its frightened mouth and horned rim glasses, which it wears at all times. The reason for its constant frightened expression is currently unknown.

SCP-7932 has shown a remarkable ability to understand and empathize with the emotions of others. It is able to detect emotional cues in speech, body language, and even scent. This has led to SCP-7932 being utilized as a reporter for the Foundation, as it is able to conduct interviews with witnesses and suspects without being detected as a non-human entity. SCP-7932's candy sticks have been found to calm it and enhance its ability to detect emotional cues.

Despite its timid appearance, SCP-7932 has shown a playful and humorous personality. It enjoys telling jokes and playing pranks on Foundation personnel, and has been known to use its empathy to cheer up other SCPs. SCP-7932's personality is considered a valuable asset in its work for the Foundation, as it is able to extract key information from witnesses and suspects through humor and empathy.

Addendum: It is recommended that Foundation personnel avoid discussing traumatic events or displaying extreme emotional responses around SCP-7932, as this has been observed to cause distress and potential harm to its mental state. SCP-7932's candy sticks should be considered an important part of its containment, as they provide both a reward for good behavior and a calming influence on its emotional state.
