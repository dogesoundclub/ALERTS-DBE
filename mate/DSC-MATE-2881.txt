Item #2881, also known as "The Traffic Officer", is a peculiar human being with a demeanor as striking as her features. She is easily recognizable with her spotted face, red clown eyes, and a red lip that curves into a constant half-smirk. Her forehead is adorned with a pair of modified goggles, which sometimes flicker in synchronization with a chuckle. Each of her jade earrings is said to hold mystical properties, but no one dares to pry further into that matter. Her medical mask hides an enigmatic expression that unnerves those who claim to have seen it.

Although she appears to be just like any other traffic officer, Item #2881 is a cold-blooded enforcer of rules, both written and unwritten. Her efficiency is unmatched, as she surveys the bustling streets with keen eyes and an unwavering focus. While her meticulous nature can sometimes lead her to be seen as a control freak, it is that very trait that makes her an excellent leader in group projects or impromptu events.

Beware, for crossing The Traffic Officer often results in dire consequences. The gold chain wrapped around her wrist usually signals the start of an interrogation, and her unrelenting pursuit of justice knows no bounds. Those who have dared to challenge her authority have been known to seek temporary asylum in other cities, as they know she's always watching, waiting for her chance to pounce. Consider yourself warned.
