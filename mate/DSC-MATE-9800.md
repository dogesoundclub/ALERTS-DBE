Item #: 9800

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9800 is to be contained within a secured habitat of no less than 2 hectares in size, surrounded by a perimeter fence at least 6 meters tall, and patrolled by no less than two armed guards at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-9800's habitat is strictly limited to personnel with Level 3 security clearance, with all interactions with the DSC to be monitored and documented in the appropriate files.

DSC-MATE-9800 is to receive regular medical check-ups and is not to be exposed to any psychological stressors or stimuli that may cause emotional distress due to its confirmed sentience.

Description: DSC-MATE-9800 is a male Bengal tiger that stands at 2.4 meters tall, and weighs approximately 250kg. The DSC's fur is orange with black stripes, normal glasses on its eyes, and green head with a 2-color band on the forehead feature. DSC-MATE-9800's ears have a single jade earring each and wears a silver necklace as its only accessory.

DSC-MATE-9800 exhibits unique sentient characteristics, possessing an individual personality that is more human-like than typical animal behavior, such as a fondness for music and art that evokes strong emotions in the DSC. Additionally, DSC-MATE-9800 is capable of exhibiting a broad range of emotions that includes empathy, sadness, and humor.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9800 was brought to Foundation attention when rumors of a Bengal tiger farmer began circulating around the region. Upon investigation, the DSC was identified and subsequently detained. During containment, it exhibited signs of domestication and appears to be capable of adapting to farm-related activities.

As such, DSC-MATE-9800 is permitted to engage in regular farm activities such as crop growing and harvesting under the supervision of Foundation staff. However, all interactions with DSC-MATE-9800, including farming, must be carefully monitored and documented.

DSC-MATE-9800 is cooperative with Foundation personnel and, despite its sentient nature, has yet to exhibit any signs of hostility towards them. Nevertheless, personnel are to be careful when interacting with the DSC and to exercise caution to prevent any accidental injury to personnel or other DSCs under Foundation containment.
