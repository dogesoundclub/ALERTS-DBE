Description:

SCP-915 is an anomalous entity that appears as a humanoid tiger wearing a hoodie and a silver chain around its neck. The subject's face is characterized by a frightened mouth and blue clown eyes, adding to its unnerving appearance.

SCP-915 exhibits a highly organized and efficient disposition, which can manifest as controlling and dominant behavior in group settings. Despite this, the subject is capable of demonstrating a dry sense of humor and a knack for delegation, making it a valuable asset in certain situations.

In addition, SCP-915 can emit an unknown gas from the normal gas mask it wears on its face. The effects of this gas are currently unknown and require further research.

Overall, SCP-915 presents a potentially dangerous and unpredictable threat, requiring constant monitoring and containment protocols.
