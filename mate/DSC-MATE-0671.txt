Item #: SCP-671

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-671 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be fitted with an air conditioning unit and kept at a temperature no higher than 20°C to ensure the well-being of SCP-671 due to its species. Due to its role as a delivery driver, SCP-671 must be allowed to leave containment to fulfill its duties as long as it is accompanied by at least two armed security personnel who are instructed to prevent any interactions with civilians outside of package delivery.

Description: SCP-671 is a male rabbit of unknown origin. SCP-671 stands at a height of approximately 53cm with blue eyes and green hair in a purple cap. SCP-671 is also identified by the red victory band that it wears on its forehead, as well as a jade earring on its left ear. SCP-671 exhibits human-like mannerisms, making use of a gold chain around its neck and a whistle that it often carries around its neck.

SCP-671 is an observant and attentive individual who excels in attention to detail. However, it also has an obsession with giving the "perfect" gift, which can cause it to spend prolonged periods of time agonizing over what to get someone. Despite this, SCP-671 is often able to deliver gifts with unprecedented accuracy due to its exceptional attention to detail.

SCP-671 also exhibits a "frightened mouth," often appearing anxious and nervous in unfamiliar situations. Due to its species, SCP-671 is unable to communicate through speech and instead resorts to body language and whistling to convey its needs and desires.

Addendum: SCP-671 has shown a capacity for self-awareness and is capable of expressing dissent at certain containment protocols. It has suggested that it be given greater autonomy and recognition of its individuality, implying a desire for a less restrictive bestowal of orders. The Ethics Committee will review its request for more freedom of movement and decision making.
