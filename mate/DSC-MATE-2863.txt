Item #: 2863

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2863 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a soundproofed environment due to his tendency to talk incessantly about obscure and irrelevant topics. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear earplugs and protective gear, including an N95-rated face mask, to prevent exposure to potential contaminants. Subject 2863 is allowed access to cosmetic materials for personal upkeep as long as it does not interfere with daily functioning.

Description: Subject 2863 appears to be a normal human male working as a beautician. However, noticeable abnormalities include a spot on their mouth and blue clown eyes, coupled with a mohawk hairstyle. Subject 2863 also wears a pair of goggles on their forehead, a jade earring, and a medical mask over their mouth, which is believed to be self-imposed due to germaphobia. Notably, subject 2863 also sports a gold chain as an accessory.

Personality-wise, subject 2863 is highly curious and fascinated by obscure knowledge. They frequently engage in discussions with others and may randomly spout obscure and trivial information. Despite this unusual trait, subject 2863 appears to function adequately in social situations, although they may struggle in lengthy social interactions due to speaking excessively.

Addendum: Discovery
Subject 2863 was brought to the Foundation's attention through reports of strange behavior, including random trivia bombardment, and wearing excessive protective equipment in their workplace. After being interrogated, the subject revealed that they had a fear of infection, which led to the unusual appearance, and they were born with blue clown eyes and a mouth spot, which they revealed to clients as a statement of their individuality. Further testing is required to determine if the abnormalities have anomalous origins.
