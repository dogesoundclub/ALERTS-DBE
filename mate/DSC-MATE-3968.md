Item #: DSC-MATE-3968

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3968 has been placed under surveillance and must remain within the boundaries of Site-██ at all times. Clearance level 2 personnel are allowed to interact with DSC-MATE-3968, but must follow strict instructions to keep conversations limited to work-related matters.

Description: DSC-MATE-3968 is a human male of average build and height, with normal glasses and a medical mask always covering his mouth. He displays two distinct facial features, a "mouth spot" and a "frightened mouth," which are presumed to be the result of previous genetic anomalies.
 
DSC-MATE-3968's forehead shows two colored band marks and a pair of goggles that he wears around his forehead. He also possesses a gold earring in his left ear and a gold chain around his neck.
 
DSC-MATE-3968's personality seems to be somewhat introverted, as they tend to be lost in thought and daydreaming. These traits often lead to comical situations where DSC-MATE-3968 may accidentally bump into objects while deep in thought. His job as a programmer is suitable for someone of his personality, as it allows for a more solitary environment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3968 was taken into Foundation custody after an incident in which he accidentally revealed confidential information to a non-Foundation member. DSC-MATE-3968 has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and does not seem to pose any immediate threat to security or containment. Further research into his genetic anomalies is ongoing.
