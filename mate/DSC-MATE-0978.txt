Item #: SCP-978

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-978, also known as Officer 978, is to be monitored within their designated police precinct. Officer 978 is to avoid revealing any knowledge of the Foundation's existence or their involvement in containing anomalous entities. Interviews with Officer 978 must be conducted with extreme caution, as they have been known to act impulsively and may not follow protocol.

Description: Officer 978 is a human female with distinctive features, including red lips and orange eyebrows. Officer 978 is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, gold earrings, a gold chain, and smoking a cigarette. These accessories are not anomalous but tend to draw attention to Officer 978. Officer 978's impulsiveness can sometimes result in amusement for those around them, but it can also lead to unpredictable situations.

Officer 978 possesses no anomalous abilities, but their role as a police officer has led them to encounter anomalous entities. Officer 978 is not aware of the existence of the Foundation or the true nature of the entities they have encountered. The Foundation has monitored Officer 978's activities and intervened when necessary.

Due to Officer 978's unpredictability, the Foundation has designated Officer 978 as a Safe-class object. Containment is limited to monitoring and intervention when necessary. Any personnel tasked with interacting with Officer 978 should exercise extreme caution to avoid compromising the Foundation's operations.
