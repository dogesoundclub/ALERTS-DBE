Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4951 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell must be kept stocked with various monkey toys and games to prevent any boredom.

Description: SCP-4951 is a male monkey of the species Cercopithecus neglectus, commonly known as the De Brazza's monkey. SCP-4951 stands at approximately 50 cm and weighs 4 kg. It has red clown eyes that have been theorized to be a result of genetic mutation or an unknown contamination. SCP-4951 sports vibrant green hair atop its head usually concealed by a purple cap adorned with a two-color band on its forehead. In addition, SCP-4951 is often seen sporting a red scarf around its neck and carrying a whistle.

SCP-4951's personality is best described as outgoing and social. SCP-4951 tends to enjoy being the center of attention and has been observed taking part in humorous situations, telling jokes or stories that would create an uncontrollable laughter among peers.

SCP-4951 has been found to possess exceptional technical abilities, particularly in the area of electrodynamics. SCP-4951 has a deep-seated obsession with electricity that appears to be the driving force behind much of its personality and motivation. The origins of these abilities are unknown, but they manifest in the form of telekinetic control over electric current.

Addendum: SCP-4951 was discovered when reports of an electrician monkey in a nearby town reached Foundation ears. Foundation agents were dispatched and apprehended SCP-4951 with relative ease. SCP-4951 has since been contained in Site-██ where it has been noted to be cooperative with facility personnel. Further research has commenced onto the nature of SCP-4951's unique abilities.
