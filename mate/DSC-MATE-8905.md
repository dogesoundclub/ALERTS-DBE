Item #: 8905 

Object Class: Humanoid 

Special Containment Procedures: Item #8905 is to be monitored at all times by undercover agents. Any attempt by #8905 to leave the designated area is to be reported immediately to the Foundation for apprehension. Interaction is to be limited to designated personnel with Level 4 clearance, who must have undergone a psychological evaluation in order to prevent possible invasion of #8905's anomalous effects.

Description: Item #8905 appears to be a human male in his late 20s, with noticeable spots on his face and a wide, charismatic smile. However, his most significant anomaly is his eyes, which are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology. He also commonly wears a gold chain and cigarette as accessories.

Personality: Item #8905 has a practical and hands-on personality that often leads him to fix things in unconventional ways. He is known to use simple tools such as duct tape and paper clips to repair and rig solutions for complex problems. However, #8905's unconventional techniques may trigger unintended anomalies where the said tools and materials started to have anomalous features.

#8905's skills as a beautician are also noteworthy, despite it showing no relevance to his anomalous skills. As #8905â€™s anomalous capabilities have yet to be thoroughly studied, researchers theorize that his anomalous properties are only activated through individual interaction.

Currently, #8905 functions as a beautician in a local salon, where he poses no immediate threat to the general populace. However, due to his anomalous properties, containment measures must be in place to prevent possible negative events from happening.
