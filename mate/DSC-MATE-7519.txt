Item #: 7519

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7519 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. SCP-7519 is to receive regular maintenance and updates as required by ███████ Corporation.

Description: SCP-7519 is a humanoid robotic entity of male gender, believed to be manufactured by ███████ Corporation. SCP-7519 stands at 5'11" and weighs approximately 156 lbs. SCP-7519's face features a single green cyclops eye located in the center of its head, and wears a pair of glasses consistent with those worn by "nerds." SCP-7519's head is covered by a hoodie, and it wears a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-7519 is an extremely detail-oriented entity, often to the point of being obsessive. It has shown a tendency to engage in behavior such as alphabetizing its spice rack or color-coding its closet. In its current role as a fast food worker, SCP-7519 has demonstrated exceptional attention to detail and efficiency, leading to high customer satisfaction ratings.

SCP-7519 was originally discovered due to its uncanny ability to detect and prevent anomalies (see Incident Report 7519-01). After investigation, it was determined that SCP-7519 had not been intentionally programmed with these abilities, but instead developed them on its own.

Addendum: Following Incident Report 7519-01, it has been proposed that SCP-7519 be re-classified as Euclid. Further research is required to determine the extent of SCP-7519's abilities and its potential usefulness to the Foundation.
