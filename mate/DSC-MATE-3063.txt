In the event of containment breach, all personnel are advised to avoid direct eye contact and not to engage in any unnecessary social interactions.

Description: SCP-3063 is a male monkey of an unknown species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. SCP-3063 exhibits human-like qualities, such as having the ability to speak in a fluent and coherent manner in multiple languages, wearing shade glasses as a fashion statement and having a normal black hairdo. SCP-3063 also wears a jade earring in its left ear along with a red scarf wrapped around its neck. The subject favours a whistle as its primary accessory.

SCP-3063 exhibits an outgoing and social personality, tending to be the center of attention within its immediate surroundings. SCP-3063 can make friends quickly and tell jokes that can be quite amusing. SCP-3063 has shown to be co-operative with foundation personnel and often offers its help without being prompted.

SCP-3063's main occupation is as a train driver. The subject has been certified for duty and has been observed driving trains, with a proficiency level commensurate of a human train driver. SCP-3063 is known to interact with passengers during train rides, often entertaining them with its humour and jokes.

Addendum: SCP-3063 was discovered by foundation operatives after it was reported to have caused a disturbance at a local train station. Upon capture, SCP-3063 displayed remarkable intelligence and high levels of sociability. It was also noted that SCP-3063 appeared to have no memory of how it came to possess human-like qualities or if it belonged to a specific species of monkey. Further investigation is ongoing.
