Item #: SCP-4716

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4716 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be soundproof and equipped with a solid steel door, as SCP-4716 has shown the ability to escape from plastic-based containers. Personnel entering the chamber must wear ear protection to avoid SCP-4716's high-pitched whistle.

SCP-4716 is to be provided with a rabbit-proof feeding station, along with plenty of toys and entertainment to keep him occupied. Daily veterinary check-ups are mandatory, as SCP-4716 has shown signs of depression and anxiety when left alone for prolonged periods.

SCP-4716 displays remarkable intelligence, surpassing that of a normal rabbit. He has shown the ability to understand human language and communicate through gestures and sounds. SCP-4716 is also a skilled programmer, able to code complex software and algorithms with ease.

Personality: SCP-4716 is charming and outgoing, always eager to make new friends and entertain those around him. He has a spontaneous side, often surprising his companions with impromptu adventures or last-minute party planning that turns out to be a hit. SCP-4716 tends to be very organized and likes to plan ahead, but he also enjoys taking risks and trying new things.

Despite his friendly demeanor, SCP-4716 has also displayed a mischievous side. He has been known to escape from his containment chamber using his programming abilities and prank personnel by rearranging their workspace or stealing their personal belongings.

Overall, SCP-4716 is a unique and valuable addition to the Foundation. While his abilities may pose a potential threat, his intelligence and outgoing personality make him a valuable asset for communication and research purposes.
