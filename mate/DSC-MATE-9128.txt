Item #: 9128

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9128 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment room. He is to be provided with amenities such as cigarettes and a red scarf as it tends to calm him down. Any violent or aggressive behavior should be reported to the Site Supervisor immediately.

Description: SCP-9128, also known as "Bugs", is a male rabbit standing at 4 feet tall. He is often seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a gold earring, and a red scarf. His most notable features are his frightened mouth and red clown eyes, which glow in low light conditions. SCP-9128's personality is vibrant and enthusiastic, which can lead to humorous situations with his colleagues.

SCP-9128 is currently employed as a fast food worker in a local restaurant chain. His job post is contained within an enclosed booth for customer orders, and he is not allowed to leave this station. Despite some initial reservations and concerns about his aggressive behavior, SCP-9128 has been a valuable employee in the restaurant chain due to his quick reflexes and attention to detail.

SCP-9128's enthusiasm can sometimes border on the irrational, as he gets overly excited about certain things that others do not find as interesting. His colleagues sometimes find his behavior uncanny, and there are rumors that he is in fact a man in a rabbit suit.

Addendum: SCP-9128 has exhibited excellent problem-solving skills and is able to handle confrontational situations with minimal assistance. He is quite resourceful and often uses his red scarf as a weapon, a tool, or even a distraction to diffuse any tense situations. SCP-9128's abilities may warrant further observation and classification.
