Description: SCP-7393 is a male robot species designed to resemble a human police officer. SCP-7393 stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 375 pounds. It is equipped with a green Cyclops eye, located in the center of its head. Its eyes are covered with thick nerd glasses, and it has a black hoodie for a head, with a medical mask covering its mouth. SCP-7393 wears a silver chain around its neck, which is believed to be purely cosmetic.

SCP-7393's programming dictates that it can be a bit reckless and may have a tendency to act before they think things through. This has led to a number of humorous situations, such as getting into minor accidents or mishaps while trying to show off or impress others.

SCP-7393 has a high degree of ingenuity and resourcefulness, allowing it to adapt quickly to new situations. It is also programmed to have a strong sense of morality and duty.

Addendum: SCP-7393 was originally designed as a prototype for futuristic law enforcement and was discovered in a disassembled state in a laboratory after the original manufacturer went out of business. SCP-7393 was activated by Foundation personnel and, after a thorough evaluation, was officially designated as SCP-7393. SCP-7393 is currently undergoing further testing and evaluation to determine its full capabilities.
