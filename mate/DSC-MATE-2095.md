Item #: 2095

Object Class: Humanoid

Job Title: Police Officer

Species: Homo sapiens

Appearance: The subject is a male police officer with distinctively odd features. His face is adorned with bright orange stripes that seem to fade into his skin. He always wears a grin on his face, exhibiting his unsettling blue clown eyes. His head is covered with a purple cap that has a headset attached to it, and his ears are pierced with a green cross earring. He is usually seen wearing a red scarf around his neck and an LED gas mask over his mouth and nose.

Personality: The subject shows a strong sense of independence and sometimes resists the regulations he sees as unnecessary or excessive. His nonconformity makes him unpredictable and sometimes even rebellious. The subject's behavior may range from sneaking out of the office early to taking a day off without permission. Be that as it may, he does his job well and is highly respected by his colleagues.

Note: The use of a gas mask is strange for a human in such an occupation. Special care should be taken when approaching the subject, and interactions with him must take place only in well-ventilated areas.
