Item #: 3584

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3584 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with enough space to ensure his comfort. Feeding schedules should be followed strictly as he is fed twice a day. No train rides are allowed within 2 kilometers of his containment area.

Description: SCP-3584 is a male tiger that works as a train driver. His appearance is quite normal for his species, except for his frightened mouth that is constantly open as if he is in distress. SCP-3584's eyes are mostly hidden, covered with a layer of fur which makes it hard to analyze its behavior. The only observed feature of its head is the green color.

3448 is often seen with a gold chain around its neck which cannot be removed without causing him harm. He also carries a whistle that he uses while operating the train as part of his duties. SCP-3584 has a habit of getting sidetracked easily and can forget things, a trait that is typical of his species. They tend to be forgetful in general, which has led to several humorous engagements and mishaps.

SCP-3584 is aware that he is different from other tigers and is prone to several psychological disorders due to his constant stress. There is a high chance of contamination from the chemicals used in train operation; therefore, all personnel in contact with SCP-3584 should wear protective gear and undergo psychological evaluations regularly.

Personnel are not authorized to ride the train operated by SCP-3584 under any circumstances.
