Item #: 3029

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3029 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Access to personal electronic devices, music players, and any means of media must be strictly monitored and limited for the safety of personnel. Any attempts to communicate with SCP-3029 should be carried out through approved channels and under the supervision of at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: SCP-3029 is a human female of indeterminate age, appearing to be in her mid-twenties, standing at 1.73 meters in height, and weighing approximately 59 kilograms. SCP-3029 possesses distinct markings in the form of spots on her face, along with orange eyebrow eyes. SCP-3029 is often seen wearing a medical mask concealing her facial features, with a tiara on her head and a red cross earring in each ear. SCP-3029 also possesses a gold chain, which she wears around her neck.

SCP-3029 is a well-known and highly reputable fashion designer, possessing a unique talent for creating clothing that evokes strong emotional responses from those who wear them. Her own emotional state appears to be highly susceptible to external stimuli, often breaking into emotional outbursts of tears or joy when exposed to sentimental moments in movies or music.

Despite possessing a highly emotional personality, SCP-3029 is highly intelligent and can be highly perceptive about the emotional states of others, making her highly manipulative in social situations. SCP-3029 often expresses frustration over her own emotional instability and seeks to find a cure for her condition.

Addendum 1: SCP-3029 was brought into Foundation custody after a highly publicized breakdown at one of her fashion shows, which resulted in the injury of several models and audience members.

Addendum 2: Testing has revealed that the clothing created by SCP-3029 possess a highly anomalous effect on those who wear them, causing highly charged emotional responses in line with the design intent of the garment. Further testing and investigation are required to determine the extent of this effect and its potential risks.
