Item #: SCP-6674

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6674 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site ██. All instances of SCP-6674-A are to be confiscated and placed in a secure locker. No contact is to be made with SCP-6674 without prior approval of two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-6674 is a female human known to the general public as a banker. SCP-6674's appearance is characterized by her spots on her face and her purple lips. Her hair is blonde and has a wing, and she wears normal glasses. Her forehead has a 2-color band and has jade earrings on her ears. SCP-6674 commonly wears a medical mask and a choker around her neck.

SCP-6674 has a strong and decisive personality, which can sometimes come across as bossy or intimidating. It appears that SCP-6674's personality is due to an anomaly in her brain, which causes her to crave efficiency and effectiveness. Despite her formidable demeanor, SCP-6674 is harmless and compliant with Foundation protocols.

SCP-6674 has also been known to possess anomalous objects known as SCP-6674-A. SCP-6674-A are a collection of pens and calculators that, when held by SCP-6674, increase the efficiency of her work. SCP-6674-A is also capable of expelling ink from the user's pores, therefore providing a steady stream of ink for normal writing.

Addendum: SCP-6674 was discovered by Foundation agents after reports of anomalous bank activity. SCP-6674 willingly submitted to Foundation containment, explaining that she was aware of her anomalous abilities and chose to hide them from the public for self-preservation. SCP-6674 has cooperated with Foundation personnel and maintains a healthy relationship with Site ██ staff.
