Item #: SCP-2206

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2206 is to be kept at Site-███ in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a bed, a desk, and a chair.

Description: SCP-2206 is a male member of the Homo sapiens species with the profession of a firefighter. SCP-2206's most remarkable trait is the ski goggle shaped eyes which he possesses. His head is covered with a dark-colored hoodie. SCP-2206 has no abnormalities in his physical appearance, but his personality is unique. SCP-2206 is very analytical and logical and loves debating with others. SCP-2206 can argue for hours, often about topics that others find irrelevant or inconsequential. SCP-2206 finds great enjoyment from the feeling of having won a debate or proving someone else wrong. This behavior rarely results in aggressive tendencies, but it can lead to humorous situations.

Addendum: Experiment Logs

Experiment 2206-01:

Objective: To observe the effects of engaging SCP-2206 in a debate/talk.

Procedure: D-█████ instructed to engage SCP-2206 in conversation.

Result: SCP-2206 quickly engaged in a debate with D-█████ regarding the differences between computer software and hardware. SCP-2206 maintained control of the conversation until he declared himself as the victor of the debate. D-█████ reported feeling intellectually inferior to SCP-2206 during the discussion.

Conclusion: SCP-2206's analytical and logical mind can be a disadvantage to those engaging him in conversation.

Experiment 2206-02:

Objective: To observe the effects of engaging SCP-2206 in a humorous situation.

Procedure: Researcher ██████ instructed to tell SCP-2206 a joke.

Result: SCP-2206 listened to the joke and paused for several seconds before asking the Researcher about the joke's historical accuracy. The Researcher attempted to explain that the joke did not require historical authenticity. SCP-2206 failed to see the humor in the joke and disregarded it as neither logical nor informative.

Conclusion: SCP-2206's analytical and logical nature makes it difficult for him to enjoy humorous situations.

Experiment 2206-03:

Objective: To observe the effects of provoking SCP-2206 with an apparently trivial topic.

Procedure: Researcher █████ instructed to engage SCP-2206 in a debate surrounding an object as insignificant as a pencil.

Result: SCP-2206 engaged in the debate and argued for several hours, presenting his opinion on the pencil's color, material, and overall design. SCP-2206 declared himself the winner of the debate, feeling satisfied with his analytical and logical conclusions.

Conclusion: SCP-2206 enjoys debating, regardless of how trivial or unimportant the topic may seem.
