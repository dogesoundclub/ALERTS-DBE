Item #: SCP-1212

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1212 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Interaction with SCP-1212 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel, with all communication monitored and recorded for analysis. Any attempt to incite emotional distress or discomfort in SCP-1212 is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-1212 appears to be a human male, approximately 30 years of age. He has a distinctive smile which he wears at all times, regardless of his emotional or mental state. SCP-1212's eyes are often concealed behind nerd glasses, and his hair is parted in a shade of bright pink. He wears a jade earring in his right ear and a silver chain around his neck.

SCP-1212 is known for his impressive ability to empathize with others, instinctively sensing and responding to the emotions of those around him. This ability has led to moments of unexpected humor or levity in otherwise difficult situations.

However, SCP-1212 is also a dangerous villain with a proclivity for manipulating emotions and mental states in others. He is able to use his empathetic abilities to turn individuals against one another or to drive them to violent or self-destructive behavior.

Interview logs with SCP-1212 reveal a strong desire for connection and understanding with others, though his methods for achieving this often result in harmful or destructive outcomes. Attempts to reform SCP-1212 have so far been unsuccessful.

Addendum: Following a violent incident during which SCP-1212 caused severe emotional trauma to several Foundation personnel, all further attempts at reform or rehabilitation have been suspended. SCP-1212 is to be considered a high-threat entity and all interaction with him is to be treated with extreme caution.
