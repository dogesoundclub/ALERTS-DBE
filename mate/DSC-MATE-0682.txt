SCP-682: Beautician

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-682 must at all times be contained within a standard monkey containment unit within Site-██. Personnel are instructed to wear protective gear before entering the containment area, as SCP-682 has displayed aggressive behavior toward humans. In its current state, SCP-682 can only be accessed by Level 3 personnel or higher, and must be accompanied at all times by at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-682 is a male monkey with a distinct red beanie atop his head, and jade earrings hanging from his ears. Its eyes take the form of ski goggles, and it typically wears a silver chain around its neck, as well as constantly smoking a cigarette. SCP-682 displays high levels of intelligence and is known for its charisma and ability to connect with others on a deep level.

SCP-682 has an uncanny ability to draw others in with humor and deep conversation, getting strangers to open up about their life stories or sharing funny anecdotes that brings people closer together. However, it is warned that SCP-682's true nature and intentions are unknown, and all interactions with the entity should be minimal and monitored closely.

Addendum 682-01: SCP-682 was originally captured by Mobile Task Force Zeta-9, due to its unusual appearance and behavior. After several incidents of escape attempts, it became clear that SCP-682 is not to be underestimated, and all precautions should be taken when dealing with this entity.

Addendum 682-02: In ██/██/████, SCP-682 displayed unusual behavior, requesting to be assigned a job as a beautician. Despite concerns from personnel, SCP-682 was granted the position and has displayed exceptional skills in this field. While interactions with SCP-682 are still limited, it has shown no signs of violent behavior toward beautician clients or staff. SCP-682's beautician license has been suspended indefinitely by O5 Council until further notice.
