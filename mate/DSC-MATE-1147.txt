SCP-1147, also known as "The Rainbow Reporter", is a human female with a penchant for adventure and a flamboyant sense of style. She is known for her striking VR Rainbow LED eyes and her Rainbow Festival head, which she often accessorizes with a goggle on her forehead and a Red Cross earring on each ear.

As a reporter for an urban fantasy publication, SCP-1147 is often found in the middle of dangerous situations, seeking out the truth and chasing after leads no matter the risk. Her love for adventure has led her to engage in activities such as bungee jumping and spelunking, which have resulted in some humorous tales of near-death experiences and getting lost in the wilderness.

Despite her penchant for excitement and danger, SCP-1147 is a skilled journalist, able to navigate the dark and dangerous world of urban fantasy with ease. She possesses a keen mind, quick wit, and a fearless attitude that make her invaluable to her publication and a force to be reckoned with in the supernatural world. Though she often plays by her own rules and takes risks that others might shy away from, her dedication to uncovering the truth and exposing secrets has earned her a reputation as one of the most reliable and trustworthy reporters in the business.

SCP-1147 can often be found smoking a cigarette, lost in thought as she ponders her next big story or prepares to launch herself headfirst into the next adventure. She is a force of nature, always on the move and always eager to take on whatever challenges may come her way.
