Item #: 864

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 864 is to be treated as a regular human and allowed to perform their duties as a police officer without interference. However, any anomalous activity displayed by 864 is to be immediately reported to the Foundation for further investigation.

Description: 864 is a human male of average height and build. Their most notable feature is their blue clown eyes, which are thought to be the result of an anomalous mutation. They often wear a short peak cap, with a two-color band around their forehead and a goggle on their forehead. 864 also sports a gold earring on their left ear and can frequently be seen with a candy stick in their mouth.

Despite their easy-going demeanor, 864 is fiercely protective of their loved ones and has been known to get into heated arguments with those who insult them. This loyal streak has been known to cause some humorous situations that have been observed to lighten the moods of those around them.

Personality: 864's laid-back and easy-going nature can cause them to come across as apathetic, but this should not be mistaken for a lack of commitment to their duties. They take their job as a police officer seriously and will not hesitate to act when the situation calls for it. Their loyalty and protectiveness towards their loved ones make them someone to have on your side, but also someone not to cross.

Overall, 864 is a reliable and trustworthy individual, though the anomalous nature of their eyes and other features should be monitored closely.
