Item #: SCP-6211

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6211 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Due to its unpredictable nature, no direct contact with SCP-6211 is allowed under any circumstances. All conversations with SCP-6211 must be conducted via intercom or video conferencing.

Description: SCP-6211 is a male simian of the species Macaca fascicularis, with the appearance of a sentient humanoid mammal. SCP-6211 is approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighs roughly 20 kilograms. SCP-6211 exhibits no anomalous physical attributes aside from its appearance.

SCP-6211 is a high-ranking politician of its own species within its own society. Apparently capable of higher cognitive reasoning, this simian displays a great intelligence beyond what is considered a 'normal' level of such primates.

SCP-6211 dons a retro cap and ski goggles covering its eyes, often decorated with a gold earring and silver chain. SCP-6211's frightened mouth suggests a level of paranoia or anxiety, evident in its apparent unease when speaking to other beings.

SCP-6211 has been observed making predictions with unerring accuracy, which some speculate makes it a medium of sorts with psychic powers. An array of tests has been carried out to identify the source of SCP-6211's “clairvoyant” abilities but their origin remains unknown.

When feeling upset or nervous, SCP-6211 tends to sense this in others, garnering a sense of eeriness from those in close proximity. It seems that SCP-6211 has an uncanny ability to detect negative emotions in those around it.

Addendum: SCP-6211’s current whereabouts are unknown. It is possible that SCP-6211 has escaped containment; all foundation personnel are advised to report any sightings of SCP-6211 immediately. Any person found aiding or harboring SCP-6211 shall be detained instantly.
