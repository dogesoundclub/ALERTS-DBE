Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1464 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with standard security measures, including reinforced steel walls and a high-tech biometric locking system. Additionally, DSC-MATE-1464 is to be fitted with a GPS tracking device at all times.

DSC-MATE-1464 is allowed to keep their mechanic shop as their workplace, but constant surveillance is to remain in effect. Any attempts of DSC-MATE-1464 to tamper with Foundation equipment, or any other try of provoking reactions from Foundation personnel will result in their immediate relocation to a more secure confinement.

Description: DSC-MATE-1464 is a female human with orange stripes on her face and blue clown eyes. They wear a purple cap with a headset, a two-color band on their forehead, jade earrings, a silver chain, and a normal gas mask. DSC-MATE-1464's physical appearance makes them easily identifiable.

DSC-MATE-1464 is characterized by valuing harmony and social connections. They often engage in lighthearted humor and banter with their colleagues, and their goofy side tends to attract great interest from personnel. DSC-MATE-1464 has a discerning attitude towards trash, and demonstrate aptitude in fixing broken or contaminated equipment.

Despite their highly desirable social skills, the Foundation never should let their guard down around DSC-MATE-1464, due to their potential capacity to delve into mischief-making. This could jeopardize the safety and well-being of other Foundation personnel and the containment of anomalies.
