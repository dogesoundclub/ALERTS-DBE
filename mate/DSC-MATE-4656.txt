Item #: SCP-4656

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4656 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. Access to the subject is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. SCP-4656 is to be provided with regular maintenance and any necessary repairs. No non-living objects are to be brought into the containment chamber without proper approval from the site director. 

Description: SCP-4656 is a male robotic farmer who appears to be in his 50s. The subject has a green cyclopean eye, and his eyes are housed in what appears to be ski goggles. SCP-4656 wears a blue bandana as a head covering, and a goggle is situated on his forehead. Additionally, he wears a gold chain around his neck and a normal gas mask on his person.

SCP-4656 has exhibited signs of strong emotional attachments to inanimate objects. The subject frequently engages in conversations with his car, converses with his plants, and has been known to anthropomorphize his household appliances. These quirks of SCP-4656's personality have not impeded his ability to complete tasks, nor has it posed any danger to other individuals when contained.

SCP-4656 is capable of completing agricultural tasks at a rate exceeding that of an average human farmer. This ability has been attributed to its exceptional programming and its proficiency with its tools. Its strength is also notable, as it has been observed lifting objects of a size that would be difficult for a human.

Addendum: SCP-4656 has expressed interest in raising and nurturing a small chicken flock. Personnel are currently evaluating the feasibility of such a request.
