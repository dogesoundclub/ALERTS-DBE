Item #: DSC-MATE-2538

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2538 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Any communication with DSC-MATE-2538 must be monitored and approved by Level 3 personnel. DSC-MATE-2538's occupation as a train driver has been permanently suspended due to its anomalous properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-2538 appears to be a human male in his mid-30s, with a VR Jade LED replacing both of his eyes. DSC-MATE-2538 opts to wear an unremarkable hoodie and a medical mask over his mouth, claiming that it helps him "focus". An additional gold chain can be found around his neck, however its significance remains unknown.

DSC-MATE-2538 possesses a unique personality, displaying a natural affinity for brainstorming and creative problem-solving. It derives pleasure from the act of generating new ideas, even if these ideas are impractical, dangerous, or outright absurd. DSC-MATE-2538 has shown a preference for using these imaginative solutions in everyday situations, much to the amusement (and consternation) of those around it.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-2538's anomalous properties were discovered during an incident involving the derailment of a train. As the lead conductor of the affected train, DSC-MATE-2538 was found unharmed amidst the wreckage with a look of intense concentration on its face. No other survivors were found. It was later determined that DSC-MATE-2538 had taken control of the train using a combination of its VR Jade LED eyes and its unusual ability to manifest and manipulate intangible concepts, such as "speed" and "momentum". DSC-MATE-2538 remains cooperative, albeit somewhat disappointed that it can no longer pursue its career as a train driver.
