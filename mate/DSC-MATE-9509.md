Description: DSC-MATE-9509 is a male humanoid of the species Homo Sapiens, standing at 1.85 meters in height and weighing 75 kilograms. He works as a delivery driver for multiple companies and has shown no abnormal physical abilities. However, DSC-MATE-9509 possesses a unique personality trait which sets him apart from normal humans. 

DSC-MATE-9509 has a tendency to be very practical and hands-on, often fixing problems in unconventional ways. His methods appear to be very unorthodox, including the use of duct tape, paper clips or other everyday objects to repair broken objects. DSC-MATE-9509's solutions to problems are often successful but do not follow traditional practices.  

DSC-MATE-9509's physical appearance includes a mohawk hairstyle and glasses with gold earring and silver chain accessories. He often sports a smile and a gas mask with LED lights, which he uses during deliveries. He also wears goggles on his forehead, which he claims to wear for extra protection during deliveries.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9509 has been observed in the company of several anomalous entities on several occasions. Further investigation revealed that DSC-MATE-9509 has been making deliveries to various anomalies in the greater metropolitan area. The Foundation is currently conducting investigations to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-9509's knowledge of the anomalous world.
