Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7634 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. She is to be provided with basic amenities such as food, water, and clothing but is not to be given access to any electronic devices or technical equipment. All communication with SCP-7634 should be recorded and monitored.

Description: SCP-7634 is a humanoid female of the human species. Her distinctive features include orange stripes and purple lips, with orange eyebrows and a purple cap with a headset. She wears gold earrings, a gold chain, and often carries a cigarette. SCP-7634 is employed as a programmer and is highly skilled in this area.

SCP-7634 has a highly idealistic personality and is motivated to make the world a better place. She is known to protest and boycott companies or causes that go against her values. These actions have led to some humorous situations.

SCP-7634's abilities have not been observed to date. However, she has been known to display erratic behavior when exposed to electronic devices, which is why she is not allowed access to any equipment. Her psychological evaluation has not revealed any abnormalities, though her behavior may warrant continued observation.

Addendum: SCP-7634's behavior suggests that she may be a potential asset for the Foundation in the future. However, her idealistic tendencies could prove troublesome if she is not properly managed. Further observation and evaluation are required.
