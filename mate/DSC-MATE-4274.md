Description: Subject 4274 is a male humanoid with blue clown eyes and an unarranged green head. The subject is often seen wearing a silver chain accessory. 4274 is currently employed as a car salesman, and is known to possess a highly empathetic and compassionate personality. However, its tendency to take on other people's problems as its own has made it a potential threat to itself and others.

Personality: 4274 is often admired for its compassionate nature, but this trait can be both admirable and exhausting. Its strong sense of responsibility for fixing everything and everyone around them often leads to overburdening stress. This can cause 4274 to act irrationally and take unnecessary risks, making containment a challenging task.

Addendum A: On [REDACTED], 4274 suffered a psychological breakdown following an unsuccessful sale. The subject proceeded to violently assault the potential customer, prompting a Level 3 Security Alert. 4274 was subdued by security forces and returned to containment.

Addendum B: Concerns have been raised about the potential for 4274's empathetic personality to be exploited by other anomalies or organizations. Close monitoring of all communications is recommended, and any attempts to manipulate 4274 should be reported immediately.
