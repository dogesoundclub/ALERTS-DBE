Special Containment Procedures: SCP-372 is not to be allowed to enter any courtrooms or legal proceedings. All meetings with SCP-372 must be recorded and supervised by at least three armed guards. SCP-372 is to be treated with caution, as it has shown an unusual degree of concern for objects and possessions, going so far as to consider them to have personalities and feelings.

Description: SCP-372 is a male human lawyer with distinctive features. Its face is covered in spots, and its mouth has a clown-like appearance. Its eyes are blue and have a clownish quality to them. On the forehead, SCP-372 has a two-color band and a pair of goggles that it wears. SCP-372 also has a green cross earring in each ear, wears a gold chain, and carries a candy stick.

SCP-372 has an unusual personality, which is marked by an excessive level of caring and nurturing. This extends not just to other humans, but often to inanimate objects, which SCP-372 will anthropomorphize and assign personalities to. These behaviors may lead to potential security threats, as SCP-372 has been known to become emotionally attached to objects deemed dangerous or inappropriate for its level of access.

SCP-372 has been known to exhibit a strong desire to help others, which can sometimes override its better judgment. We advise against asking SCP-372 to act in matters of the law, as its impulse to help people may lead to conflicts of interest.

SCP-372's head and facial features are not arranged in a manner consistent with typical human physiology. The source of these unique features is currently unknown. SCP-372 shows no signs of discomfort or abnormal function in its present state.

Additional Notes: SCP-372 has expressed an interest in assisting with the containment of other SCPs, claiming that it would like to help those in need. However, its highly empathetic nature may pose risks to personnel involved in the containment of more dangerous entities.

SCP-372 requests that it be allowed to visit the Foundation's botanical gardens to tend to the plants. This request is currently under review.
