Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7743 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber located in Site-██. Due to the nature of her occupation as a veterinarian, SCP-7743 is authorized to work with a limited number of animals for the purposes of research and experimentation. However, all animals must be screened and approved by Site Director ████ prior to interaction with SCP-7743.

Description: SCP-7743 is a female of the human species, with the appearance of a late 20s to early 30s age range. Her most notable and noticeable features are the orange stripes and purple lip present on her face. Her eyes are VR Jade LED and skin tone is a pale white complexion. SCP-7743 sports a retro cap, with a goggle attached to her forehead. Her mouth is consistently covered with a medical mask.

SCP-7743 exhibits a highly analytical and logical personality. She is very detail-oriented and often silent, except when delivering witty quips or opinions that are signified by a deadpan delivery. SCP-7743 is interested in the careful and meticulous care of animals, and is often seen observing or attempting to diagnose their conditions.

Addendum: SCP-7743 has expressed interest in studying and documenting the relationship between anomalous entities and their animal counterparts. Site Director ████ has authorized a small team of personnel to work with SCP-7743 on this project.
