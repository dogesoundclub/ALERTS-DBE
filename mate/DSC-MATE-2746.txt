SCP-2746 is a humanoid entity that is identified by their unique appearance, which leaves no one indifferent. The specimen is a female doctor with spots across their face and purple lips, but it is SCP-2746's red clown eyes that truly catch the attention of those who meet them. In place of their mundane human head, SCP-2746's head is that of a pink rabbit with a pair of red cross earrings adorning her long ears.

It is said that SCP-2746 has a contagious sense of humor that spreads faster than the most potent virus. They enjoy making others laugh and are willing to go to great extents to achieve that goal. SCP-2746 is not just a doctor; they are a jester that lightens the mood of the people around them. The personality trait of being humorous makes it exceedingly difficult to detach oneself from SCP-2746's charms.

SCP-2746 is frequently seen with a cigarette in hand, the scented smoke serving not only as an addiction but also as a means of keeping themselves relaxed.

Cautionary protocols have been established around SCP-2746 to limit the exposure of their humor-inducing personality to the general public. Anyone who encounters SCP-2746 is required to wear a mask and protective eyewear to prevent the contagious spread of laughter.
