Item #: SCP-9574

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9574 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Any attempts at escape by SCP-9574 are to be met with non-lethal force in order to minimize the risk of injury. SCP-9574 is allowed access to the Site-██ recreational facility during designated times as approved by the Site Director. 

Description: SCP-9574 is a male humanoid of the species Homo sapiens. SCP-9574 has spots all over their face, a smile on their lips, and wears a red scarf around their neck. SCP-9574 is often seen smoking a cigarette, and possesses a pair of VR Rainbow LED eyes and a green cross earring. Although SCP-9574 is of average height and weight, their physical attributes are augmented by an unknown anomalous effect, making them more agile and fast than most humans.

SCP-9574 claims to be a police officer and has displayed a strong sense of duty and responsibility. They take their job very seriously and will often put themselves in danger to protect others. However, SCP-9574 also likes to have fun, and their sense of humor can sometimes be inappropriate. They enjoy dancing and are often the life of the party at social events, where they sometimes engage in silly antics or surprise others with their moves.

SCP-9574's anomalous properties are still under investigation. However, it's suspected that they are somehow connected to the rainbow LED eyes, as they glow brighter when SCP-9574 is excited or agitated. SCP-9574's containment cell has been outfitted with cameras and monitoring equipment to study their behavior and further understand their abilities. 

Addendum: SCP-9574 has displayed proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and firearms training. It is recommended that security personnel undergo additional training to protect themselves from SCP-9574.
