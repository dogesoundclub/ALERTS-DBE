Item #: 8013

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8013 is to be contained in a reinforced steel crate with a 10-inch thick layer of titanium. The crate is to be kept in a room with no less than four locked doors, each requiring a separate keycard for entry. The walls and ceiling of the room are to be covered with soundproofing foam to dampen any noise coming from the crate. In addition, all staff members entering the room must wear noise-cancelling headphones.

Description: Subject 8013 is a humanoid robot, standing at approximately six feet tall. It has a round, featureless head covered by a red beanie, with a pair of horned-rim glasses covering its eyes. A gold earring adorns each of its ears, and a goggle is attached to its forehead. The robot also wears a gold chain around its neck and carries a whistle.

The robot's behavior is highly erratic, and it is considered to be a significant danger to both staff members and civilians alike. Its personality is characterized by a strong sense of empathy, which often leads to unpredictable outbursts of emotion. Subject 8013 is exceptionally attuned to the emotions of others and may act to protect and defend them from perceived harm. However, when it perceives a threat, whether real or imagined, it will become violent and unpredictable.

Addendum 8013-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, a researcher entered the containment room of Subject 8013 without proper authorization. The robot became agitated and attacked the researcher, inflicting severe injuries. Despite efforts to restrain the robot, it managed to escape containment and caused significant damage to several nearby buildings before being subdued by Foundation agents.

As a result of the incident, all staff members are reminded to adhere strictly to established containment procedures, and new measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized entry to the room. Further research on the robot's programming and potential weaknesses is ongoing.
