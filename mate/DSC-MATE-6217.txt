Item #: SCP-6217

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6217 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit. Interaction with SCP-6217 is to be kept to a minimum and must only be conducted by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Under no circumstances should SCP-6217 have access to medical equipment or medications of any kind.

Description: SCP-6217 is a female human identified as a Doctor. SCP-6217's most notable features are her red lips and orange eyebrows. Additionally, SCP-6217's head appears to be that of a pink rabbit. Observations have shown no unusual behavior outside of the apparent physical anomalies. The Doctor may appear relatively normal if not for the previously mentioned features.

SCP-6217's personality traits have proven to be somewhat of a wildcard. She can be impulsive and has a tendency to act on her emotions without thinking things through. Without proper supervision, SCP-6217 may unintentionally cause anomalous occurrences around her. Such events can lead to minor danger or confusion among both SCP-6217 and researchers.

SCP-6217 also wears a gold chain and appears to cherish this accessory. Despite questioning, no significance has been attributed to the chain, other than being a "lucky charm."

Addendum: Following an incident in which SCP-6217 administered inappropriate treatment methods on a patient, all medical authorizations and equipment belonging to SCP-6217 have been revoked, and her license status has been revoked. While it remains uncertain if SCP-6217 has intentionally conducted any anomalous act, it is suggested that personnel expose as a minimum as possible to avoid accidental events.
