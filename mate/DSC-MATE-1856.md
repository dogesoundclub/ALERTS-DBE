Item #: 1856

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to his non-hostile nature, 1856 is allowed limited freedom within the city, provided he remains within human-populated areas. Surveillance is to be set up at all fashion shows, events, and establishments that 1856 frequents. Personnel are advised not to approach or interact with 1856 without prior permission from a senior researcher or director.

Description: 1856 is a male tiger with a humanoid physique, standing approximately 6 feet tall. He is distinguishable by the red beanie on his head, jade earring on his left ear, and two-color band on his forehead. He typically wears a red scarf and carries a whistle as additional accessories.

While 1856 displays an affable demeanor in public, it is currently unknown if this is a natural trait or a carefully crafted persona to avoid unwanted attention. His occupation as a successful fashion designer indicates an exceptional level of intelligence, creativity, and outward confidence.

Reports have indicated that 1856 possesses a unique ability to form deep and meaningful connections with those around him, often eliciting personal stories or eliciting laughter with his humorous anecdotes. However, the extent of this ability is currently unknown and requires further study.

Despite his relative lack of threats towards humans, 1856's anomalous status and non-human appearance make him a potential danger to public safety. As such, all interactions with 1856 must be monitored and logged for research purposes. 

Addendum 1856-A: On ██/██/20██, sightings of 1856 were reported in a forested area outside the city limits. An investigation was launched, resulting in the discovery of a hidden cabin and several personal effects belonging to 1856. Upon further analysis, researchers discovered that 1856 had been living off the grid for several months, raising questions about his true intentions and the extent of his abilities. Further research is ongoing.
