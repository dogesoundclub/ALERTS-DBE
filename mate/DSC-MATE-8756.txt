SCP-8756, codenamed "The Beautician", is a male human with striking VR jade LED eyes that glow in a mesmerizing pattern. The entity is often seen wearing a bucket hat, a silver chain, and a cigarette in his hand, giving him an edgy and unconventional appearance. 

SCP-8756 works as a beautician, but his true passion lies in acquiring knowledge about obscure topics. He revels in collecting rare books, documentaries, and other educational materials, driven by a thirst for knowledge that is insatiable. 

SCP-8756's expertise in beauty is rumored to be supernatural, allowing him to transform his clients' appearances with a mere touch. However, it is unclear if his beauty techniques are related to his anomalous properties. 

SCP-8756 can be highly enthusiastic and passionate when sharing his newfound knowledge with others. However, care must be taken as his obscure and forbidden research has been known to cause madness or other abnormal behaviors in those who listen.  

Experiments have shown that SCP-8756's glowing eyes emit a low-level radiation, which can have physical effects on those around him. For this reason, direct contact with SCP-8756 has been strictly forbidden, and any interaction must be conducted through video or audio communication. 

In conclusion, SCP-8756 is a fascinating yet dangerous entity, with an immense thirst for knowledge and an anomalous expertise in beauty. Careful observation and strict protocol must be adhered to while interacting with this entity to ensure the safety of all parties involved.
