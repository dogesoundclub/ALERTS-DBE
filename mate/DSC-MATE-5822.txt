SCP Foundation file #5822: The Feline Veterinarian

Subject #5822 is a tiger of unknown origin with a knack for veterinary medicine. The subject bears a frighteningly open mouth, possibly indicating past trauma or an innate sense of danger. Its blue clown eyes, on the other hand, suggest a playful demeanor that belies its fearsome appearance.

The subject displays an emotional vulnerability not often seen in its kind. It possesses a deep empathy for others, animals included, and may cry or exhibit outbursts of emotion in response to adversity. 5822's love for nature and the creatures it cares for marks it with a unique desire to protect all forms of life.

5822 is most at home in its black hoodie, which it wears on warm summer days as readily as it might don a parka in the depths of winter. It seems the hoodie serves as both a physical and emotional shield for the tiger-veterinarian.

Approach 5822 with caution, but know that despite its fearsome appearance, it is a creature with a heart full of compassion.
