Item #: SCP-7474

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7474 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-7474 is granted only with approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

SCP-7474 is to be provided with a standard-issue medical mask for the safety of personnel, and its green cross earring must be securely attached at all times.

SCP-7474 is permitted to continue practicing as a veterinarian within containment, but all animals that come into contact with SCP-7474 must be thoroughly screened for any potential anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-7474 is a male human with striking orange stripes on his face, emanating from beneath his medical mask. Its frightful mouth appears to be perpetually open, revealing sharp teeth within. SCP-7474's eyes are equipped with intricate and advanced VR jade LED technology, and is capable of projecting holographic images in front of its intended targets.

SCP-7474's physical appearance is completed with a green cross earring and a gold chain necklace.

SCP-7474 exhibits a naturally charismatic and charming personality, often utilizing humor and humorous antics to engage those around it. It is fond of telling jokes and performing silly dances to entertain those in its presence.

SCP-7474 has been known to possess anomalous effects on nearby animals, including making them more docile and friendly towards humans. However, studies have shown that SCP-7474 has no conscious control over these abilities.

Addendum: SCP-7474 requested a reassignment to veterinary work within the Foundation after being discovered displaying anomalous effects on animals outside of containment. SCP-7474 stated that it hopes to use its abilities to help the Foundation with animal-based containment and research. This request was approved.
