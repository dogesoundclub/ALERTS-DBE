Item #: 1579

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1579 is to be kept under close surveillance at all times. He is to be contained in a maximum-security prison facility, with no access to any communication devices whatsoever. Any attempt to communicate with the outside world or to exert his influence must be immediately reported to the DogeSoundClub.

Description: DSC-MATE-1579 is a human male, with blue clown eyes and spot-like marks on his face. He sports a mohawk hairstyle and wears a silver chain as his accessory. Two color bands can be seen on his forehead, and he wears a goggle as a headgear. Additionally, his ears are pierced with green cross earrings.

DSC-MATE-1579 is a notorious Mafia boss who had gradually gained immense influence in the criminal underworld. His success can be attributed to his empathetic and compassionate personality. However, this also becomes his weakness, as he would attempt to fix everything and everyone around him by taking their problems as his own. This has led to him being sympathized by his subordinates and others, growing his reputation and power.

DSC-MATE-1579's powers extend beyond his empathetic personality. He has been reported to possess telepathic abilities to influence people's thoughts, aspirations, and desires. The extent of his mental manipulation powers has yet to be determined.

DSC-MATE-1579's containment was developed after numerous failed attempts to incarcerate him permanently. He was known to have powerful allies with colossal influence and wealth, who had made their attempt to release or smuggle him out of any facility.

DogeSoundClub, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, was able to apprehend him finally. Any attempts, either internally or externally, to free or influence 1579 must be strictly neutralized.
