Subject 1781, also known by his villainous moniker, "The Joker", is a human male with distinct clown-like features. His most prominent facial feature is his clown mouth, which always curls into a sinister grin. His eyes, mesmerizing and piercing, are a vivid shade of blue that almost seem to glow with madness. Adorning his head is a bright red beanie, a symbol of his playful and unpredictable nature.

The subject also wears a green cross earring, perhaps a nod to his nefarious past, as the "Joker" is known for his twisted sense of justice. He accessorizes with a thick silver chain and a constant burning cigarette, often flicking ashes onto the ground with glee.

Despite his penchant for chaos, the Joker is a commanding figure with a strong and decisive personality. His imposing presence can come across as bossy or intimidating, but beneath it all, he simply wants to ensure that things get done efficiently and effectively, even if it means resorting to dastardly methods.

It is advised to approach the Joker with extreme caution, as he is cunning and manipulative, using his trademark humor and charm to lull his victims into a false sense of security before striking. His malevolent actions have earned him his place among the most notorious villains in the city, and he remains a constant threat to the stability of the urban environment.
