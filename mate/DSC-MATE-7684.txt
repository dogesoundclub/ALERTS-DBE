SCP-7684 is an anomalous human being that works as a veterinarian. Their most distinctive features are the orange stripes on their face and their purple lips. SCP-7684's eyes have orange eyebrows that serve as an identifier for Foundation personnel.

SCP-7684 always wears a hoodie that covers their head and the top of their face, which makes it hard to discern their facial expressions. However, SCP-7684 has a two-color band on their forehead, which may indicate their emotional state.

SCP-7684 is always seen wearing a silver chain, which is believed to hold a sentimental value for them. Additionally, they always wear a gas mask, which makes it difficult to discern if they are smiling or frowning.

SCP-7684 has a no-nonsense attitude and values tradition deeply. They like to tell jokes and stories that have been passed down through their family or community, which often leads to humorous situations. SCP-7684's playful side can make them an asset in team-based operations.

SCP-7684 is aware of their anomalous status and has agreed to cooperate with the Foundation. However, their lack of facial expressions and the gas mask make it hard to read their emotions, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Regardless, SCP-7684 is a valuable asset to the Foundation and their role in protecting humanity from the supernatural threats that lurk in the shadows.
