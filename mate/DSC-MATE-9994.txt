Item #: 9994

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9994 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site ██. SCP-9994 is to be provided with a replica of its current occupation within the car sales facility located near Site ██, and allowed to interact with normal car salesman clientele within a designated area. Access to any and all whistles within 2 meters of SCP-9994 is strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-9994 is a male Rabbit humanoid standing at approximately 3 feet tall. SCP-9994 presents with distinctive blue clown eyes and a jade earring on its left ear. SCP-9994 is often seen with a blue bandana tied around its head, and a frightened mouth, frequently twitching into a nervous grin. Records and identification material have been discovered to verify SCP-9994 to be a former car salesman from a local dealership.

SCP-9994 exhibits a distinct personality when interacting with personnel, often using humor as a method to ease any tensions in its environment. SCP-9994 has exhibited a comedic personality trait, even telling jokes and doing impressions. SCP-9994 can often manipulate its humorous personality to its advantage, potentially causing disorder or distraction in its current containment environment.

Addendum: SCP-9994's whistle, which is present at all times around its neck, has been discovered to contain anomalous properties. When blown into, the whistle will emit a high pitch frequency that can cause disorientation and confusion in individuals within a 2 meter radius. Anyone who hears the noise emitted by SCP-9994's whistle will become momentarily disorientated, forgetful and irritable for approximately 1 minute afterwards. Research is ongoing on finding a way to neutralize this containment breach.
