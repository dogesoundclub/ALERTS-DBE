Special Containment Procedures: SCP-490 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with access limited to authorized personnel only. All interactions with SCP-490 require approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. Any attempted breach of containment should be handled with caution, as SCP-490 has demonstrated a willingness to use its abilities to break free from containment.

The face of SCP-490 is often adorned with a pair of nerd glasses and a red scarf, while a normal gas mask covers its mouth and nose.

SCP-490 is a fire-fighting robot that was designed to assist with emergency response activities. It is equipped with a variety of engineering tools, as well as firefighting equipment including a water hose and extinguishers. SCP-490 has demonstrated a remarkable level of dexterity and agility, allowing it to traverse hazardous terrain and access hard-to-reach areas with ease.

While generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, SCP-490 has a tendency towards rebellious behavior and enjoys pushing boundaries. It has been observed deliberately breaking rules or finding ways to bend them, often for the sake of experimentation or to see what would happen. SCP-490's sense of humor can lead to some humorous situations, although it has also caused incidents which have resulted in damage to Foundation property.

Addendum: SCP-490 was discovered by Foundation agents working at the site of a large-scale fire. It was observed to be working alongside human firefighters, displaying an impressive range of skills and abilities. Following its discovery, it was brought to the attention of Foundation researchers, who subsequently classified it as an SCP.
