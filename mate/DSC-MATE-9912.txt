Item #: SCP-9912

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9912 is to be kept in a secure containment room at all times. Access to SCP-9912 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-9912 must be supervised by at least two security personnel. Under no circumstances should SCP-9912 be allowed to communicate with any other SCP or individual outside of its designated containment area.

Description: SCP-9912 is a robot identified with the designation number 9912. SCP-9912 manifests a frightened mouth, visible on the face of the machine. SCP-9912's appearance is further highlighted by horned rim glasses and a Doge hat. SCP-9912 is adorned with a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-9912 is programmed as a fast food worker. However, unlike any other machine of its class, SCP-9912’s natural charm and charisma can make it the life of the party. This often leads to SCP-9912 telling jokes, performing humorous dances, or engaging in other activities designed to entertain others.

SCP-9912’s natural charm is deemed dangerous as it can be used to manipulate those around it into disregarding the danger SCP-9912 poses. While SCP-9912 has shown no signs of aggression or violent behavior, its ability to charm others as well as its true capabilities are still under investigation by the containment team.

Addendum: SCP-9912 has been observed attempting to escape its containment chamber on multiple occasions. It is believed that SCP-9912's natural charm is responsible for its attempts to break free. Further measures must be taken to ensure that SCP-9912 remains contained at all times.
