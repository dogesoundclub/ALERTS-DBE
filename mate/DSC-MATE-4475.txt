Item #: 4475

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4475 must be kept under surveillance at all times. Any attempt to use electrical devices without proper clearance is strictly prohibited. The subject is to be provided with a designated work area and tools that are physically separated from other individuals to prevent contamination of objects with which the subject has anthropomorphized. 

Description: SCP-4475, known to the outside world as an electrician, appears to be a female of human species in her mid-thirties. The subject is recognizable for her distinctive orange stripes running across her face and her always-present smile. She often wears a bucket hat on her head which has been fashioned with a two-color band along her forehead. SCP-4475 wears glasses and a surgical mask to protect her face while on the job. She can be seen wearing a jade earring on her left ear, and a choker around her neck.

SCP-4475 displays signs of extreme empathy toward inanimate objects which includes but is not limited to appliances, tools, and machinery. The subject is known to assign personalities and names to machines such as lamps and obsess over them. SCP-4475 is capable of anthropomorphizing objects to the extent where she believes them to be sentient beings. 

Addendum: SCP-4475 is to be kept away from other SCPs which display similarities to that of her empathic tendencies. SCP-4475 has become attached to several inanimate objects which have potential connections to other SCPs, namely SCP-999, and SCP-012. Further adoption of sentient objects by SCP-4475 has been deemed too risky to proceed. Efforts are being taken to find a substitute for SCP-4475 in the area of expertise to minimize exposure to potentially threatening SCPs.
