SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-7950

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7950 is currently allowed to freely roam the city as a delivery driver. It is currently contained through the use of a tracking device, ensuring that it does not leave the designated delivery routes. Under no circumstances should SCP-7950 be sent on any delivery beyond these routes, as it has shown resistance to containment when outside of its established boundaries.

Description: SCP-7950 is a human male with spotted facial features and blue clown eyes. It has parted pink hair with a two-color band on its forehead and a green cross earring in each ear. SCP-7950 can often be seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7950 displays an extremely analytical and logical personality, enjoying debates and arguments with others, often about trivial or unimportant topics. This has led to humorous situations where SCP-7950 becomes impassioned about a subject others may find trivial. However, caution must be taken as SCP-7950 has exhibited a tendency to become aggressive during debates and arguments.

Addendum: SCP-7950 has eluded Foundation containment several times, including during a delivery that went beyond its established boundaries. During this incident, SCP-7950 was able to evade MTF units and escape into the city. Further investigation is necessary to determine if SCP-7950 possesses any anomalous abilities that allow it to evade containment.
