Addendum: Incident Report 435-01

On █/██/20██, DSC-MATE-435 became agitated and attempted to break out of its containment chamber. It demanded to see its "partner," whom it claimed was in danger. Under the pretext of checking the DSC-MATE-435's chamber, personnel checked on this "partner," who was revealed to be a stuffed tiger toy. DSC-MATE-435 calmed down after the toy was returned to its chamber, leading researchers to believe that DSC-MATE-435 has a belief that the toy is alive and requires protection. Further research is ongoing.
