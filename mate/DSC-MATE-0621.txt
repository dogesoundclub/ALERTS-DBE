Item #: SCP-621

Object Class: Safe

Description: SCP-621 appears to be a humanoid robot, designed to resemble a male police officer. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters tall and displays a variety of human-like traits, including speech, movement, and facial expressions. SCP-621's most notable feature is the purple cap it wears, along with a red cross earring on its right ear. SCP-621's eyes are covered by normal glasses and it wears a silver chain around its neck.

Despite being a machine, SCP-621 displays a vivacious and energetic personality. It is highly enthusiastic about various aspects of its job, such as investigations, interrogations, and arrests. SCP-621 enjoys getting others excited about things and can sometimes become overly excited about topics that others find less interesting.

SCP-621 has proven to be a valuable asset to any police department it is assigned to, displaying a high level of precision, intelligence, and adaptability. Its robotic nature has allowed it to perform tasks that would be dangerous or impossible for humans to do.

Addendum: A recent investigation into SCP-621's creation and origin has turned up inconclusive results. It is believed that SCP-621 was created by an unknown organization, possibly as a prototype for humanoid robots designed for law enforcement. Further investigation into SCP-621 and its origins is ongoing.
