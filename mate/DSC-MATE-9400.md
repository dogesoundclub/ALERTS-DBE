Special Containment Procedures:

Agent squads are to perform patrol duties around the Theater in which DSC-MATE-9400 works as a Manager. A strict access protocol must be followed to prevent breaches of containment by unauthorized individuals. A GPS tracking device must be discreetly installed on DSC-MATE-9400's cloths. In case of emergency, all personnel should retreat to a safe distance and let the emergency task force handle the situation.

Description:

DSC-MATE-9400 appears to be a human-sized tiger with a police cap on its head and a gold chain around its neck. The Tiger's unique features include a jade earring and an indescribable style of eyes. DSC-MATE-9400 is vocally fluent in English, allowing for easy conversation about any subject or inquiry. DSC-MATE-9400 has a decisive personality that sometimes conveys bossiness or intimidation. However, this behavior is only because DSC-MATE-9400 ensures all tasks are completed effectively and efficiently.

DSC-MATE-9400 claims to have held its current managerial position in several local theaters, though their longevity in each role is uncertain. DSC-MATE-9400 expresses great pride in his role and is eager to make the theater an enjoyable experience for all patrons that visit. DSC-MATE-9400 has exhibited great proficiency in theater management, leading to increases in ticket sales when assigned as a Theater Manager.

DSC-MATE-9400 may engage in unpredictable behavior that can lead to property damage or physical harm (See Addendum-9400A). Furthermore, DSC-MATE-9400 can break through most residential doors, even those made of sturdy materials such as metal or concrete. The reason for such behavior is still unknown.

Certain staff members claim to have had visual or audible hallucinations while working on the theater premises. These hallucinations are often attributed to DSC-MATE-9400's behavior, but the nature of the experience remains a mystery. DSC-MATE-9400 has also been documented to detect and follow DSC's presence, indicating an abnormal sensory ability. 

Addendum-9400A:

DSC-MATE-9400 has shown a predisposition for stressing the importance of efficient task completion. Any action that is regarded as an ineffective way of completing a task is likely to cause aggression towards the individual. Therefore personnel must have caution and follow the designated protocol when dealing with DSC-MATE-9400. DSC-MATE-9400 does not appear to respond to pain, making it challenging to discern when it should cease its aggressive behavior. DSC-MATE-9400 may also become excessively violent if conditions such as sound, light, or temperature are not within specific parameters.
