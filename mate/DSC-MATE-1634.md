Item #: DSC-MATE-1634

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1634 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with bedding and furnishings appropriate for a small animal. The chamber must contain at least three layers of security, including biometric scanners, remotely activated locks, and a guard on duty 24/7. Any attempts at unauthorized entry must be met with deadly force.

Description: DSC-MATE-1634 is a male anthropomorphic rabbit standing 1.2 meters tall. It wears a doge hat on its head, and sports a gold earring on its left ear. DSC-MATE-1634 has a red scarf draped around its neck and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-1634's most notable facial feature is its frightened mouth, which appears to quiver and tremble even when not expressing fear. Its eyes are protected by ski goggles, which remain on at all times. DSC-MATE-1634 has a creative and artistic side that it expresses through various artistic hobbies, including painting, drawing, and writing.

DSC-MATE-1634's anomalous properties manifest when it is subjected to intense negative emotions, including but not limited to fear, anger, and sadness. When exposed to these emotions, DSC-MATE-1634 transforms into a large, violent rabbit-like entity capable of causing significant destruction.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1634 was discovered when a small farming community reported a series of inexplicable animal attacks. Foundation operatives responded to the incident and encountered DSC-MATE-1634 in the act of transforming. It was subsequently contained without incident. Research is ongoing to determine the origin and nature of DSC-MATE-1634's abilities.
