Item #: 356

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 356 is to be allowed freedom of movement within the general population, as his anomalous traits present no direct threat to human life. If necessary, Foundation operatives are permitted to monitor his activities and interactions with others in order to ensure compliance with operating procedures. 

Description:

Subject 356 is a male humanoid standing at approximately 6 feet tall. He has a distinctive Mouth Spot located just below his lower lip which is of unknown origin. He is further distinguished by a pair of VR Jade LED eyes, which remain on even when he is asleep. His head is shaved completely bald in the style of a monk, while his ears have a Green Cross Earring that seems to be of religious significance. While in public, the subject wears a Medical Mask to cover the lower half of his face. 

The subject's personality appears to be solitary and introspective. He often spends hours lost in thought or daydreaming, sometimes leading to comic situations where he stumbles or walks into objects. It is unclear whether this is a side effect of subject's anomalous properties or simply his own natural inclination. 

Notes:

Subject 356 is presently employed as a Delivery Driver, and has not exhibited any abnormal behavior related to his anomaly while performing his duties. However, further observation might be necessary to uncover any potentially dangerous effects from his anomaly. 

DSC-MATE-356 is currently undergoing psychological evaluation, but thus far has shown no signs of intent to harm or any other concerning behaviors. Testing procedures are ongoing, and updates will be provided as new information becomes available.
