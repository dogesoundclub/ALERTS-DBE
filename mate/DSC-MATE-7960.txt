Item #: SCP-7960

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7960 is to be kept under constant surveillance by agents disguised as potential clients. Monitoring of all telephone and internet communications is mandatory. SCP-7960 is allowed to operate as a Real Estate Agent as long as all clients show no sign of being affected and no anomalies are reported. SCP-7960 is not allowed to be in contact with any other SCPs during any part of their work hours.

Description: SCP-7960 is a female human appearing to be approximately in her mid-thirties who practices as a Real Estate Agent. SCP-7960 has striking jade green LED eyes and frequently sports a cigarette in her left hand. SCP-7960 is usually seen with a set of Jade Earrings and most often seen sporting bright red lipstick.

SCP-7960 possesses an incredibly dry sense of humor that can catch those around her off guard. SCP-7960's delivery of deadpan humor is usually unexpected, but can be surprisingly funny. SCP-7960 is usually introverted and prefers to keep to herself.

Addendum:

SCP-7960 has been seen to come in contact with other SCPs, specifically SCP-XXXX while on the job. SCP-XXXX has been documented to cause psychological disturbances to its victims, and SCP-7960 appears to be immune to its anomalous effects. However, as per protocols, SCP-7960's monthly psychological evaluation has been scheduled to ensure no subtle psychological effects.
