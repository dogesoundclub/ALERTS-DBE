Item #: 3044

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3044 is to be kept in a standard containment cell suitable for humanoid animals. Their diet may consist of a vegetarian diet, but peppered with occasional sugary treats. They are allowed to keep their police cap as it does not pose any particular threat to the safety of the facility. Access to candy sticks should be limited to prevent the subject from becoming too distracted. Any attempts to exert dominance over subject 3044 should be avoided, as they may feel uncomfortable and become less cooperative.

Description: DSC 3044 is a rabbit that stands at 1.2 meters in height. They possess a peculiar addiction for candy sticks which are often seen poking out of their mouth. It is important to note that the candy sticks do not possess any anomalous traits in themselves. However, subject 3044 is seen often to refuse any help, even when clearly required. The subject may resort to trying to move heavy objects alone, and show some reluctance to use maps when lost.

Such tendencies may be linked to a strong sense of independence that they possess. According to surveillance, they spend their time reading books on the law and fully understanding their rights. It is also clear from our observations that they have practical knowledge of the law, indicating that they have worked as a lawyer at some point in their life. This alone raises some interesting questions and concerns about the purpose of their existence.

Despite the potential danger posed, DSC 3044 is deemed safe for public interaction as long as they are not provoked. They could act as a great lawyer, as their knowledge of the law, coupled with their independence, can be a useful asset in certain, specialized situations. However, care must be taken to ensure that subject 3044 maintains focus and does not become too distracted by sweet treats.

Addendum: Observations have shown that the subject possesses an acute hearing ability, which could prove helpful in detecting any suspicious activity within the facility. This ability is somewhat unusual, but it is not yet clear if it is related to any anomalous quality possessed by DSC 3044.
