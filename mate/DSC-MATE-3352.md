Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3352 is to be kept in a secure, windowless room at all times. Access to the subject is limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance and above. All communication with the subject must be done via intercom. The subject must be provided with a steady supply of carrots and candy sticks, which are its primary sources of sustenance. Any attempts by unauthorized personnel to access the subject or interact with it must be met with immediate termination.

Description: Subject 3352 appears to be a male rabbit of the Leporidae family. However, closer inspection reveals that it possesses certain human-like physical characteristics, such as the ability to wear jewelry, glasses, and headgear. The subject is often observed wearing a red beanie, horned-rimmed glasses, and a red victory band on its forehead. Additionally, it has a jade earring on one of its ears and is often seen with a candy stick in its mouth.

Subject 3352 displays an unusual sense of humor, often delivering deadpan jokes and puns that catch people off guard. Despite not considering itself to be the life of the party, the subject has a way of making those around it laugh with its wit and sarcasm. It is important to note, however, that the subject can be unpredictable and even hostile when provoked or threatened.

Addendum: Testing has shown that Subject 3352 possesses certain anomalous properties. When exposed to a particular frequency of sound, the subject is able to generate a localized reality distortion field, which can be potentially hazardous to personnel and the surrounding environment. Further investigation is ongoing.
