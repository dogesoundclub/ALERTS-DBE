Subject 6370, also known as "The Lawyer" is a unique specimen of the human race. Their face is adorned with striking orange stripes and their head is always covered with a hoodie, worn even in the most formal occasions. The most striking feature of their forehead is a two color band, a mark of their mysterious background.

Subject 6370 is known to be a successful lawyer, often taking on cases involving supernatural beings and creatures. They are extremely knowledgable in the law, and is often sought out for legal counsel by both humans and supernatural entities.

However, it is their insatiable thirst for knowledge that makes them truly fascinating. The Lawyer spends much of their free time researching obscure topics and collecting books and documentaries related to the paranormal. They have been observed to be particularly interested in ancient religions and esoteric practices.

Strangely enough, despite their love for knowledge, Subject 6370 is surprisingly secretive about their own origins and personal life. They seem to prefer to keep their personal relationships at a distance, often disappearing for weeks on end to indulge in their research.

It is important to note that while The Lawyer appears to be completely human, their fascination with the supernatural and obscure may indicate that they have been exposed to anomalous phenomena in the past, or that they possess some latent ability not yet discovered.

All personnel are advised to treat Subject 6370 with respect, and not to underestimate their abilities as a lawyer or as a potential asset to the Foundation's paranormal research.
