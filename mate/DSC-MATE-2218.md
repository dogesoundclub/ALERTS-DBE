Item #: 2218

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2218, also known as "The Electrician," is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a minimum size of 6 meters by 6 meters. The walls of the chamber must be made of reinforced steel, and the floor must be lined with a rubber material to prevent electrical discharge. 2218's VR Rainbow LED eyes must be covered with a blackout mask at all times, given their potentially hypnotic effect. 

Description: 2218 appears to be a male monkey standing approximately 1 meter tall. The subject's blue bandana and silver chain are believed to be self-imposed accessories, although their significance is unclear. The subject's most notable feature is its permanently frightened mouth, which is believed to stem from a past traumatic experience. 

The Electrician's origins are unknown, but it has displayed an unusual proficiency with electrical gadgets and repairs. If given access to broken equipment, 2218 has been observed utilizing unconventional methods such as duct tape or paper clips to fix the problem. Even given a lack of tools or resources, 2218 is known to rig up makeshift solutions to problems deemed too difficult or complex for others.

Although not aggressive, 2218's electrical discharge abilities pose potential hazards to personnel in its vicinity. It is imperative to keep 2218's gas mask in good condition and to ensure it is worn at all times, as the subject can emit harmful gases when threatened or frightened.

Addendum: As of 04/██/████, 2218 has been known to display an unexpected level of intelligence as it has been observed attempting to escape its containment cell. Further intelligence tests and monitoring of this subject's abilities are currently underway.
