Item #: 8453

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8453 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with a minimum size of 4 meters by 4 meters. All access to DSC-MATE-8453's containment cell must be approved by at least two level 4 personnel, one of whom must be of primate-disposition. 

In order to prevent possible transfer of DSC-MATE-8453's anomalous capabilities, clothing and accessories are to be removed during decontamination procedures. DSC-MATE-8453 is allowed a selection of non-anomalous clothing within the containment cell, but their personal effects are to be kept under constant surveillance. 

Description: 

DSC-MATE-8453 is a male simian of the genus Macaca fascicularis, with fur covering the majority of its body. DSC-MATE-8453 stands at a height of roughly 1 meter 30 centimeters including its impressive hat. DSC-MATE-8453 is known to adorn its head with what it refers to as a "doge hat," which appears to reference a meme that has gained prominence among the younger generation of humans. Additionally, DSC-MATE-8453 dons a jade earring and a red scarf, the origin of which is yet unknown.

DSC-MATE-8453's most exceptional trait is its ability to commandeer vehicles and control the flow of traffic within the city utilities grid. DSC-MATE-8453 has been observed to possess above-average driving skills and utilizes this knowledge to direct traffic patterns in a manner that, while unusual, is not impeding or harmful during rush hour loads. 

DSC-MATE-8453 is also known for displaying some impulsiveness and emotional-driven decision-making. Such elements have led to accidental and humorous events, especially when interacting in a social manner with non-anomalous personnel. These antics include but are not limited to: 

- Performing driving stunts that may be viewed as unsafe
- Irrational attempts at feats that are beyond the limitations of a civilian traffic officer
- Difficulty in refraining from using a slang vernacular and memes to engage with staff both on and off duty. 

DSC-MATE-8453 is otherwise respectful of the authority that has been placed above it and has not shown any signs of malevolent or malicious intent. 

Addendum 8453-1: After several attempts, it has been deemed unnecessary to extract DSC-MATE-8453, as its skills for directing traffic within the city utilities grid have proven to be beneficial to pedestrians and commuters alike, facilitating unforeseen reductions of vehicular congestion during peak hours. Further interactions with DSC-MATE-8453 will be monitored and recorded, and its effect on the city's transport network shall be analyzed as part of an ongoing assessment.
