Subject 5536, also known as "The Banker", is a curious individual to behold. At first glance, they appear to be a completely average human male. However, upon closer inspection, one cannot help but notice the peculiar orange stripes that adorn his face. These stripes seem to be a natural characteristic of the subject, but their origin is unknown to us at this time.

The Banker's most striking feature, however, is his unwavering smile. No matter the situation, this expression remains plastered on his face, earning him a reputation as a cheerful and friendly individual.

The Banker's eyes are obscured by a pair of nerd glasses, adding to his astute and knowledgeable appearance. His head is crowned with a headset equipped with LED lights that flicker and change colors in time with his emotions.

One notable accessory he always carries with him is a normal gas mask, which seems odd given his profession as a banker. The reason for this remains a mystery, and it is speculated that it may be related to his unknown past.

Personality-wise, The Banker is an independent spirit. He prefers to handle things on his own and may stubbornly refuse help even when he desperately needs it. This quirk can lead to some humorous situations, such as his attempts to move heavy furniture on his own or his refusal to use a map when lost.

In conclusion, subject 5536 is a curious and enigmatic individual, and further observation is required to fully understand his motivations and potential uses in our endeavors.
