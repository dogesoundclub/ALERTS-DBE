Item #: 1940

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1940 is to be kept within a standard 2.5 meter clear plexiglass chamber, with adjustable lighting and environmental control. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear appropriate gear to prevent accidental contact with the entity. Daily food and water provisions will be supplied by designated staff. Subject 1940 is not to be allowed to leave their containment chamber at any time, for any reason. 

Description: Subject 1940 appears to be a male rabbit standing 15 inches tall on his hind legs, with a frightened expression and a police cap on his head. The entity's eyes are multi-colored VR Rainbow LED's that seem to always glow with an intense excitement. Subject 1940 is also adorned with a single Jade Earring in his left ear.

While containment procedures have so far been effective, interactions with Subject 1940 have revealed an extremely energetic and enthusiastic personality. Due to this, anyone engaging with the entity should take care to avoid overly stimulating Subject 1940. Failure to do so may result in the rabbit's excitement becoming chaotic or even dangerous.

Subject 1940's abilities appear to be limited to an increased sense of speed and agility, which may make them useful in specific infiltration or scouting situations. However, due to the entity's naturally frenetic personality, any such use would require strict monitoring and controls.

Personnel are reminded that engaging with Subject 1940 can be entertaining, but also potentially hazardous. Therefore, any interactions with the entity should remain professional and purposeful, with a focus on strictly adhering to the guidelines of containment.
