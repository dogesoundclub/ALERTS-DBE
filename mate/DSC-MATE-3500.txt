Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3500 is to be contained at Site-██ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Any requests made by SCP-3500 are to be reviewed and approved by at least two Level 3 personnel before being granted.

Description: SCP-3500 appears to be a human male in his early thirties. SCP-3500's most prominent feature is his orange-striped face, which is often accompanied by a smile. SCP-3500's eyes resemble ski goggles, and he wears a green cross earring on his left ear. He is often seen wearing a monk's hood, a gold chain around his neck, and carrying a candy stick.

SCP-3500 displays a friendly and open personality towards everyone, often engaging in playful banter and telling jokes to those around him. SCP-3500 values social harmony and close personal relationships, often going out of his way to create connections with those he encounters.

Addendum: SCP-3500 was discovered when a number of individuals claimed that he had "defended them in court, even when no other lawyer would take the case." Foundation agents investigated the claims and found that SCP-3500 was indeed a successful lawyer, recognized for his ability to persuade juries and judges. When he was approached by Foundation personnel, SCP-3500 was willing to come peacefully and aid the Foundation in any way possible.
