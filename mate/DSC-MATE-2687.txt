Item #: 2687

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2687 is to be monitored by a mobile task force at all times while on duty as a delivery driver. SCP-2687 is to be provided with regular psychological evaluations and counseling sessions to prevent any potential breaches of Foundation security.

Description: SCP-2687 appears to be a female human in their early 30s with several distinctive facial features. They exhibit spots on their face and have a bright red lip, which may be enhanced with cosmetics. SCP-2687 has blue clown eyes and sports pig tails on their head. Their forehead features a two-color band and their ears bear a red cross earring. They are often seen with a cigarette in their possession.

SCP-2687's personality is characterized by introspection and frequent daydreaming, which can lead to humorous situations. They are prone to walking into poles or tripping over objects while lost in thought. These tendencies make SCP-2687 an unpredictable and potentially dangerous entity if not properly monitored.

Addendum: SCP-2687 came to the attention of the Foundation after several reports of strange occurrences were linked to their deliveries. Alterations in space-time, extreme weather changes, and outbreaks of anomalous creatures were reported in the vicinity of SCP-2687's delivery route. Further investigation revealed that SCP-2687 was inadvertently causing these events due to their unpredictability and introverted nature. SCP-2687 was promptly contained and monitored for any further disruptions.
