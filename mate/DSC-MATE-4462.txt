Item #: SCP-4462

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4462 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access must only be granted to Level-3 personnel or above. SCP-4462 must be supplied with appropriate clothing and equipment for its occupation as an electrician.

Description: SCP-4462 is a rabbit species humanoid, measuring approximately 1.6 meters in height. Its eyes are a bright blue color and appear similar to clown makeup. SCP-4462's head is adorned with a purple cap with a headset, and its forehead features a two-color band. It wears a jade earring and a gold chain.

SCP-4462 exhibits a scatterbrained personality and can easily become sidetracked or forgetful. While often resulting in comical situations, this characteristic renders SCP-4462 susceptible to making mistakes, causing potential danger to itself and others. SCP-4462 is employed as an electrician and displays exceptional knowledge of electrical systems, despite its deficiencies in recall and focus.

Addendum-4462-A: SCP-4462 was discovered after being reported by several civilians of an anthropomorphic rabbit fixing electrical systems without proper equipment. Foundation agents quickly identified and retrieved SCP-4462 before it could cause any harm. The rabbit was cooperative and was easily contained with minimal resistance. Neural scans show no anomalous brain activity, suggesting its anomalous properties reside solely in its physical appearance and behavior. Testing of SCP-4462’s origin is ongoing.
