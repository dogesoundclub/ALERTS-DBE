When engaging with SCP-1784, extreme caution is advised. Due to the mesmerizing effect of his red clown eyes, all individuals should wear protective eyewear when in his presence. In addition to this, all communication with SCP-1784 should be done through indirect means, such as text or email, as his forgetfulness can lead to miscommunication and potentially dangerous outcomes.

Overall, SCP-1784 may be forgetful, but his skills as a programmer and his unique personality make him a valuable resource to the Foundation.
