[BEGIN LOG]

Dr. ███████: Please state your name for the record, and what brings you here.

DSC-MATE-7457: My name is [REDACTED], and I'm not sure what you mean by "here." I work at the salon downtown, if that's what you're referring to.

Dr. ███████: Yes, the salon. I've heard that you have quite the reputation among your clients. Care to elaborate on that?

DSC-MATE-7457: [Laughs] Well, I suppose I do. I try my best to make everyone feel comfortable and cared for, whether it's a simple trim or a full-blown makeover.

Dr. ███████: And why is that?

DSC-MATE-7457: Why? It's just what I enjoy doing. Seeing people's faces light up when they feel good about themselves? Nothing beats that feeling.

Dr. ███████: I see. Do you ever feel that you care too much about your clients?

DSC-MATE-7457: [Pauses] What do you mean?

Dr. ███████: Well, you've been known to "adopt" friends and family members and care for them as if they were your own children. Do you think that's healthy?

DSC-MATE-7457: [Sighs] I know what you're getting at. But honestly? If caring for someone is wrong, then I don't want to be right. And as long as they're happy and taken care of, I don't see the harm in it.
