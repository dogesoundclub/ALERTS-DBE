Item #: SCP-507

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-507 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any communication with 507 should be closely monitored for potential breaches of security protocols. Personal items belonging to 507 and the orange stripes on their face must be documented and evaluated for possible anomalous properties. A red scarf is to be provided to SCP-507 at their request.

Description: SCP-507 is a human male, approximately 30 years old. They have orange stripes across their face which appear to be a permanent feature. SCP-507 often wears a red scarf and a green cross earring in their left ear. They work as an electrician for Foundation sites and participate in social events with other personnel. SCP-507 demonstrates a strong desire for harmony and social connections, which can manifest as playful banter or practical jokes.

SCP-507's anomalous properties manifest as unpredictable teleportation, which may occur when they lose consciousness or fall asleep. SCP-507 may wake up in a completely different location, often a public area, without knowing how they got there. These teleportations are completely unpredictable, and SCP-507 may end up anywhere on the planet. The cause of these anomalous abilities is currently unknown.

SCP-507 has a positive attitude towards their situation and generally exhibits a very optimistic personality. However, their impulsive teleportation presents several security concerns for the Foundation.

Addendum: Due to the potential danger of SCP-507's abilities, a tracking device has been implanted to assist in containment. Any individuals found aiding SCP-507 in their escape from Foundation custody will face disciplinary action.
