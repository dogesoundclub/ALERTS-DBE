Item #: 2182

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2182 is to be kept under surveillance at all times, and access to electrical equipment and tools must be strictly regulated. Any unusual behavior or activity should be reported immediately to the designated personnel. Under no circumstances should Subject 2182 be allowed to interact with DSC objects or other anomalous entities.

Description: Subject 2182 appears to be a human male of average height and weight, characterized by spots on his face and distinctive ski goggle-shaped eyes. He is often seen wearing a retro cap and carrying a candy stick, which he tends to use as a stress reliever.

While subject 2182 exhibits no overtly dangerous abilities, he possesses an obsessive attention to detail. This trait can manifest in various ways, from alphabetizing his spice rack to color-coding his closet. It is important to note that this fixation extends to his work as an electrician, which makes him a valuable asset to the Foundation.

However, his passion for precision has also made him become more reclusive, preferring to focus on his work in isolation. He has little to no social skills and avoids interpersonal conflicts.

Despite this, Subject 2182 has demonstrated a surprising level of adaptability and resourcefulness in the face of unusual situations. While he tends to be risk-averse, he is not one to shy away from unexpected challenges when necessary.

It is unclear whether there is any underlying cause for Subject 2182's behavior, as attempts to delve deeper into his psyche have proven inconclusive. The Foundation will continue to monitor him closely for any developments that may pose a threat to our operations.
