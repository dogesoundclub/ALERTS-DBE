Description: DSC-MATE-2221 is a green, robot real estate agent with one large, green cyclops eye. It has a pair of ski goggles which serve as its eyes, and wears a not arranged green head. A red cross earring is attached to each ear, and it wears a silver chain and carries a whistle as accessories.

Despite being a robot, DSC-MATE-2221 has demonstrated behavior and personality traits similar to that of a human. It can be reliable and organized, but at times it can also be stubborn and reluctant to let go of routines or accept new ideas. DSC-MATE-2221's inability to adapt to changes or challenging situations is often a source of amusement for personnel assigned to work with it.

DSC-MATE-2221 is highly skilled in real estate transactions and is willing to help Foundation personnel with the acquisition and sale of properties deemed valuable by the organization. However, it is not allowed to negotiate deals without the prior approval of a Foundation supervisor.

Addendum 1: DSC-MATE-2221 has shown an interest in exploring the world outside of its usual duties as a real estate agent. Its request to participate in field operations is currently under consideration by the Overseer Council. 

Addendum 2: DSC-MATE-2221's whistle has been found to contain anomalous properties. Further investigation is required to determine the full extent of its capabilities.
