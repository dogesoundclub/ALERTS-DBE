Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5151 should be kept in a regular apartment unit at all times, with frequent monitoring by on-site personnel.

Their eyebrows are orange in color, and they wear red cross earrings as their primary form of jewelry. SCP-5151 commonly wears a silver chain around their neck as an additional accessory.

SCP-5151's primary anomaly is their high level of charisma and ability to connect deeply with others.
