Item #: DSC-MATE-5935

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5935 is to be contained in Site-███'s humanoid containment chamber. DSC-MATE-5935 must wear a white noise-emitting helmet at all times to prevent their abilities from influencing those around them. Additionally, DSC-MATE-5935's broadcasting station has been modified to ensure that any transmissions are devoid of any memetic or cognitohazardous properties, with any violations resulting in immediate reprimand.

Description: DSC-MATE-5935 appears to be a human female, with orange stripes on her face and purple lips. She has orange eyebrows, green cross earrings, goggles on her forehead, and is dressed in 00s school uniform, with a two-color band across her forehead. DSC-MATE-5935 is a news anchor who, when broadcasted on live television, speaks memetic commands that heavily influence the audience's opinion.

DSC-MATE-5935 has never used her memetic abilities to cause harm, but her personality can lead to humorous situations. She enjoys debating and arguing with others, even over trivial topics. However, this personality trait, coupled with DSC-MATE-5935's abilities, poses a significant security risk.

Dr. ██████: Very well. Thank you for your cooperation, DSC-MATE-5935.
