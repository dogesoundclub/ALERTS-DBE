Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-358 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with ample space for the subject to move around freely, as well as a whistle to be used in case of emergency. Any objects related to theatrical performances must be removed from the chamber to prevent damage. DSC-MATE-358's glasses must also be checked regularly for any modifications.

Description: DSC-MATE-358 is a male tiger of indeterminate age. DSC-MATE-358 stands at approximately 2 meters tall when standing on its hind legs. Its eyes contain nerd glasses, and it wears a bucket hat upon its head. A two-color band and a goggle are located on DSC-MATE-358's forehead, and it also wears a jade earring on each ear. DSC-MATE-358's most notable accessory is a whistle.

DSC-MATE-358 displays a highly analytical and logical personality. It enjoys debating and arguing with others for sport, regardless of the importance of the topic. This trait can lead to humorous misunderstandings, such as a heated debate about a trivial matter. DSC-MATE-358 must be monitored regularly to prevent it from escaping containment to engage in such debates with humans.

DSC-MATE-358's job as a theater manager is a curious aspect of its personality. Whether this was a previous occupation or one it has adopted is unknown. Any theatrical objects are to be removed from DSC-MATE-358's containment chamber, as it has demonstrated a strong affinity for these objects. DSC-MATE-358 has been observed acting out various scenarios and productions, sometimes including other DSCs within its performances.

Due to DSC-MATE-358's unpredictable behavior, all personnel are advised to engage with the subject in a professional and neutral manner to avoid any arguments. In case of an escape attempt, DSC-MATE-358's whistle must be confiscated immediately.
