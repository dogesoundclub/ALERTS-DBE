Item #: SCP-4553

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4553 is to be monitored at all times via remote surveillance, with at least one armed guard stationed outside their place of residence. SCP-4553's anomalous properties have been known to manifest spontaneously, and thus no personnel are to be permitted within a 5m radius of SCP-4553 without proper authorization and protective gear.

Description: SCP-4553 is a human male in his late thirties, standing at approximately 1.8m in height. SCP-4553's most distinguishing feature is a peak spike protruding from the top of their skull, which grows at a rate of 0.2 cm per day. SCP-4553's hair is black and its texture is coarse and unmanageable. 

SCP-4553 often sports a silver chain necklace and regularly has a candy stick in their mouth that appears to have no effect on their physiology or demeanor. 

SCP-4553 displays an ambitious personality, frequently setting lofty goals for themselves and displaying a strategic and organized approach to achieving them. SCP-4553 is known to take on more than they can handle, but their problem-solving abilities usually allow them to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. 

SCP-4553's anomalous properties allow them to manifest sudden and extreme bursts of physical strength, agility, and speed that aid in achieving said goals. These manifestations of anomalous properties have caused injury to personnel and led to accidental damage of Foundation property, and thus are to be avoided if at all possible. 

Addendum: SCP-4553 has expressed interest in using their anomalous properties to aid the Foundation in specialized missions, demonstrating a clear understanding of the risks and dangers involved. The Ethics Committee is currently reviewing this request.
