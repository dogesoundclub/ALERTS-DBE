Item #: 8153

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8153 is to be contained in a standard primate habitat, furnished with all necessary amenities, including a hammock, branches for climbing, and a variety of toys. Personnel entering the containment area must wear full protective gear, including respirators, as 8153 has displayed aggressive tendencies towards humans.

Description: Identified as a male monkey, 8153 presents a unique appearance, resembling that of a modern-day politician. The subject’s head is adorned with a purple cap and a headset attached to a communication device. Ski goggle-like eyes and gold earrings enhance the bizarre appearance of this anomalous creature. 8153 is frequently seen carrying a silver chain and a candy stick, which it is quick to offer to its visitors.

8153 possesses a highly advanced level of intelligence and often engages in complex verbal communication using a combination of sign language and vocalizations. The subject likes to brainstorm creative ideas that sometimes result in absurd solutions to problems. As a result, 8153’s humor sometimes belies its true intentions, and caution should always be exercised during interactions with the subject.

The subject can display aggressive behavior towards humans, and due to its highly advanced communication capabilities, has been known to incite other primates within its containment area to join it in its attacks. Care should be taken to avoid confrontation with 8153, and all interactions should be conducted with the utmost caution.

Investigations have revealed that 8153’s anomalous abilities may have derived from a rare genetic mutation, which has given it a unique set of skills and traits. Studies are ongoing to determine the extent of 8153’s capabilities and to uncover any other anomalous properties that may have gone undetected.

Addendum: 8153 has expressed a particular interest in modern-day politics, and it has been observed to engage in telepathic communications with other subject's of anomalous nature. Further investigation into its capabilities is highly recommended.
