File #7856: "The Striped Enforcer"

Species: Human

Sex: Female

Physical Description: The Striped Enforcer stands at an unassuming 5'6", with short hair the color of a summer sunset. Her most noticeable feature, however, is the bright orange stripes that streak across her face, standing out like garish war paint. Her ears are adorned with a pair of red cross earrings, nearly as bold as her stripes. She often wears a leather choker around her neck, adorned with a small silver charm in the shape of a wolf's head.

Personality: Don't let her casual nature fool you - this Security Guard's loyalty to her loved ones burns hot and bright, like a wildfire ready to consume anything that threatens what she holds dear. She has a sharp wit and doesn't shy away from confrontation - in fact, she seems to welcome it with open arms. Witness reports have lauded her for taking down aggressive humans and supernatural entities alike, seemingly with ease. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for anyone in need, and will go to great lengths to help someone in trouble.

Containment Procedure: Under no circumstances should The Striped Enforcer be underestimated. Although she seems friendly and approachable, she is an incredibly skilled fighter and should be treated with the utmost caution. Her allegiance to her loved ones makes her a potential liability, and she should be kept far away from any entities or humans that may threaten them. In the event of a security breach, The Striped Enforcer is authorized to use lethal force.
