Item #: SCP-7379

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7379 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██, furnished with standard amenities appropriate for humanoid containment. SCP-7379's cell is to be monitored by CCTV cameras to ensure adherence to the containment procedures.

SCP-7379 is to be given access to a sketchpad and art materials to satisfy their creative needs. Personnel interacting with SCP-7379 in their cell are advised to exercise caution as SCP-7379 may attempt to manipulate them emotionally.

Description: SCP-7379 is a humanoid creature, ostensibly resembling a monkey, standing at five feet, ten inches tall. SCP-7379's species is currently unknown. However, SCP-7379 is biologically similar to a primate, possessing digitate hands with opposable thumbs, which have fine motor control, allowing SCP-7379 to create intricate designs.

SCP-7379's most notable feature is its red clown eyes, which lack pupils, and are known to alter in hue depending on SCP-7379's emotional state. SCP-7379's head is adorned with a Police Officer Amusement Park Hat, and its ears are decorated with a gold earring.

SCP-7379 prefers to dress in fashion-forward clothing, often changing outfits multiple times a day. SCP-7379 has a particular fondness for haute couture and frequently requests designer clothing from its caretakers.

SCP-7379 is intelligent and can communicate effectively. Still, it is prone to emotional manipulation and may become overly invested in the problems of others, often to its physiological harm.

Addendum: SCP-7379's creations are of a high-quality standard, and suggestions have been made to utilize SCP-7379's creative abilities. However, it is currently deemed too risky to allow SCP-7379 to interact with the public in any capacity, as its ability to emotionally manipulate may cause unforeseen consequences.
