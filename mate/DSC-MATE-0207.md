Item #: 207

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 207 is to be monitored through standard surveillance measures, with bi-weekly checks on their current location and well-being. Any deviations from their expected behavior are to be reported immediately to the designated Site Supervisor.

Description: Item 207, also known as "The Salesman," is a human male with distinctive orange stripes on their face and a mohawk on their head. Their eyes are adorned with VR Rainbow LED contact lenses, and they sport a green cross earring on their left ear. They are often seen wearing a silver chain around their neck, and carrying a cigarette.

Despite their unique appearance, The Salesman is, for the most part, a normal human being. However, they possess a forgetful and absent-minded personality that can cause some minor disturbances. They tend to become consumed by their projects, causing them to forget appointments or lose track of time. This forgetfulness can lead to humorous situations but can also be a cause for concern.

Due to their tendency to lose track of time, The Salesman's work schedule needs to be monitored closely, as they can sometimes forget important sales or customer appointments. Sales records of The Salesman have shown that they have an uncanny ability to persuade customers to purchase a vehicle, often using creative and unorthodox methods.

Addendum: It is noteworthy that Item 207 seems to be immune to any form of memetic manipulation or anti-cognitohazardous effects. This unique resilience may be due to their unique physically augmented characteristics, but this hypothesis requires further study.
