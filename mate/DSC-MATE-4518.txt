Item #: SCP-4518 

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4518 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. SCP-4518 is to be monitored on a regular basis to ensure compliance with containment procedures. Due to SCP-4518's occupation as a banker, appropriate measures have been taken to ensure that no financial malfeasance can occur.

Description: SCP-4518 is a male human standing at 1.8 meters in height. The only observable facial feature of SCP-4518 is a perpetually present smile. SCP-4518's eyes are obscured by what appears to be ski goggles. SCP-4518 wears a hoodie, with a medical mask covering the lower half of their face. SCP-4518 is often seen wearing a gold chain.

SCP-4518 has the ability to become emotionally affected by sentimental moments in various media, including movies and TV shows. SCP-4518 is also fond of music and art that evoke strong feelings. This makes them particularly susceptible to emotional manipulation.

SCP-4518 is employed as a banker, likely due to their charismatic nature and ability to easily manipulate others. As such, the Foundation has deemed it necessary to closely monitor SCP-4518 to prevent financial malfeasance.

SCP-4518 has not demonstrated any abnormal physical abilities at this time. However, it should be noted that SCP-4518's ability to manipulate others through emotional means may pose a threat to containment efforts.

Addendum: SCP-4518 was discovered after a series of incidents involving SCP-███ led to an investigation of local bank records. SCP-4518's financial records showed a suspiciously high amount of wealth for their reported income, leading to an investigation by Foundation agents. SCP-4518 was subsequently detained for questioning and containment. Further investigation is ongoing.
