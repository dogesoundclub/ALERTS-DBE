Item #: SCP-163

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-163 is to be kept under surveillance at all times and is not allowed to leave the designated containment areas without the presence of at least two armed guards. The subject must be provided with cigarettes and other amenities as requested, and their due diligence in traffic control and management is paramount in maintaining containment. Should SCP-163 show signs of agitated or erratic behavior, immediate isolation and removal from duty is advised.

Description: SCP-163 is a human female with the ability to control traffic, particularly in congested or gridlocked areas. The subject is covered in orange stripes and sports a purple lip, with blue clown eyes and a purple cap with a headset. Their green cross earring and gold chain serve as distinctive features. SCP-163 is often seen smoking cigarettes when not engaged in traffic management.

Personality-wise, SCP-163 exhibits a strong sense of independence and stubbornness, often refusing to ask for assistance even in particularly difficult or dangerous situations. The SCP has been observed attempting to move heavy objects or navigate unfamiliar terrain despite being heavily unprepared, resulting in humorous scenarios for personnel tasked with assisting the subject.

SCP-163 poses a unique threat, as their presence in gridlocked cities can lead to rapid spread of potentially dangerous situations. The potential for damage to nearby structures and civilians makes it necessary to maintain strict containment measures, while not impeding the SCP's ability to facilitate traffic flows. Should the SCP ever manage to fully lock down a major city street or highway, MTF agents will be required to intervene and forcibly relocate the entity to a more manageable location.
