SCP-514 is a human male who works as a news anchor. He is easily noticeable due to his distinctive spots on his face, which stand out even under the glare of television lights. Despite his rough exterior, SCP-514 has a warm and welcoming smile that can put even the most nervous interviewee at ease. 

SCP-514 is always seen wearing a pair of normal glasses that he uses to read his script while on air. Underneath his glasses, his eyes are unremarkable in appearance. However, he often covers his mouth with a medical mask to protect his vocal cords from damage, partially obscuring his features.

While SCP-514 may appear unassuming at first glance, he has a bit of a wild side. He enjoys impromptu adventures and is not easily rattled, preferring to take life's obstacles in stride. However, SCP-514 can also be fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about. Cross him or insult his friends, and he won't hesitate to engage in a heated argument with you. 

To maintain security, SCP-514 is to be monitored at all times through his broadcasting feed. Any unauthorized attempt on SCP-514's life will be dealt with swiftly and decisively.
