Item #: SCP-5791

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5791 is to be kept within its designated office, which has been retrofitted with a modern sound system and lighting to suit its needs. Personnel must not attempt to interact with SCP-5791 outside of scheduled monitoring and maintenance sessions. If SCP-5791 exhibits aggressive or anomalous behavior, contact security immediately.

Description: SCP-5791 is a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye as their primary feature. It stands 1.9 meters tall, and is typically seen wearing a bucket hat, goggle on its forehead, and a red scarf around its neck. SCP-5791 works as a theater manager, executing all managerial duties with precision and efficiency.

SCP-5791 exhibits a love of adventure, often breaking from its routine to explore new areas, meet new people, and try new things. They enjoy taking risks and experiencing new adventures, leading to some humorous stories such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. However, it will always maintain its responsibilities regarding the theater.

Despite their adventurous spirit, SCP-5791 is a placid and easy-going entity, often taking an active interest in the people around them. Conversations with it are generally pleasant and enjoyable, as it has a vast knowledge base and can educate people on all manner of topics.

SCP-5791 appears to lack emotions and free will, following all assigned tasks promptly and competently. Its programming is advanced enough to allow for some level of independent decision-making when it is necessary.

Addendum: SCP-5791 has expressed an interest in becoming a Foundation explorer and has requested permission to accompany Mobile Task Force units on expeditions. While SCP-5791's inclusion would be unorthodox, its unique abilities and adventurous nature could prove useful in the field. A proposal for its inclusion is currently under review.
