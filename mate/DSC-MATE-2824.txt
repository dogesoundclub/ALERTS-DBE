Item #: 2824

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2824 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at all times when not in use. Access to the item may be granted to Level-2 personnel or higher with approved clearance. Under no circumstance should Item 2824 be used without supervision from security personnel.

Description: Item 2824, also known as "The Mechanic," is a male tiger standing at approximately 6 feet tall when on two legs. The subject's head is not arranged in the usual way a tiger's head would be, and it has a green tint to it. Item 2824 is easily recognized by the red cross earring on each ear, and the gold chain necklace around its neck. 

In addition, Item 2824 can frequently be found with a candy stick in its mouth. Despite its intimidating appearance, The Mechanic has a frightened mouth that appears to be perpetually open. It's unclear whether the mouth is due to an injury or a genetic abnormality. 

Personality: The Mechanic is a highly spontaneous and unpredictable individual. It enjoys living life on the edge and taking risks for the thrill of it. Despite being a tiger, The Mechanic shows little to no signs of aggression and is highly approachable by humans. 

Despite its somewhat humorous antics, it is important to remember that The Mechanic has claws and teeth that are highly dangerous. Its unpredictable nature requires careful supervision at all times, to ensure there are no incidents with personnel. 

However, Item 2824's unique set of skills have made it highly valuable to the Foundation. Its proficiency as a mechanic for both human and anomalous vehicles has ensured that it is frequently called upon to work on various Foundation projects.
