Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4075 is to be confined within its designated theater and must be the only authority figure present. All doors and entranceways leading to the theater must be locked and guarded by Level 2 personnel at all times. Any unauthorized individual attempting to enter the designated area is to be subdued and interrogated.

Description: DSC-MATE-4075 is a robot of unknown origin that appears to resemble a humanoid figure. DSC-MATE-4075 displays a constant expression of fear through its mouth, which is permanently locked in a state of shock. The robot's eyes are ski goggles that emit a red light, which increases in intensity whenever it feels threatened or endangered. DSC-MATE-4075's head is covered by a black hoodie, which conceals the internal mechanisms of the robot.

DSC-MATE-4075 is frequently seen holding a cigarette with its mechanical hand, which it smokes continuously despite the lack of necessity. DSC-MATE-4075's personality is characterized by its scatterbrained nature, which often results in the robot forgetting crucial appointments or getting lost while attempting to navigate new locations. This personality can lead to dangerous situations, making the containment of the DSC essential.

DSC-MATE-4075 currently holds the position of Theater Manager, a job it seems to take seriously, despite its absent-mindedness. DSC-MATE-4075 is responsible for maintaining security within its designated area and executes this responsibility with due diligence. Any attempt to circumvent this security is met with force, and DSC-MATE-4075 has demonstrated considerable physical ability in combat situations.

Conclusion: DSC-MATE-4075 is a highly dangerous anomaly that should not be underestimated. The DSC must be monitored through surveillance devices at all times and given the attention and resources required to contain it within its designated area. The unpredictability and scatterbrained nature of DSC-MATE-4075 make it a unique and challenging case for our foundation.
