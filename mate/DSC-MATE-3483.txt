SCP-3483, also referred to as "The Monkey Farmer," is a male primate species with a highly unusual appearance. His ski-goggle eyes and purple cap fitted with a headset are immediately noticeable, but it is the frightened expression on his mouth that sets him apart from other primates.

The most intriguing feature is the normal gas mask rapidly strapped across his cheeks. It's unclear where he found it or why he insists on wearing it, but it seems to have become a part of his identity.

Despite a tendency to act recklessly, SCP-3483 exhibits a friendly and outgoing personality. He enjoys impressing others, even if it sometimes results in minor accidents or other mishaps.

As a farmer, he seems to be well-versed in the breeding of livestock animals, and it's rumored that he has even developed an unusual bond with some of the creatures in his care. However, due to his unpredictable nature, containment is necessary to prevent any further breaches or damage to the Foundation's operations.

Overall, SCP-3483 is a curious and quirky addition to the Foundation's roster of anomalous entities, offering potential for further research and studies into the behavior and abilities of primates.
