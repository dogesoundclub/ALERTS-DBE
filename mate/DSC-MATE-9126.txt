Item #: SCP-9126

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9126 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to its cell is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Under no circumstances should anyone touch SCP-9126 without proper authorization and protective equipment. Its diet consists of fresh fruits and vegetables, provided by the onsite kitchen staff.

Description: SCP-9126 is a male rabbit of undetermined age and origin. Its physical appearance includes a frightened mouth, normal glasses, and a red beanie on its head. SCP-9126 accessorizes with a gold chain around its neck. It works as a real estate agent, despite lacking the proper qualifications and paperwork. SCP-9126's personality is nurturing and caring, often acting as a surrogate parent to those around it. This behavior extends to other SCPs, testing personnel, and Site staff. SCP-9126's caring tendencies, while seemingly harmless, can cause problems with testing and containment protocols.

Addendum 9126-A: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-9126 was discovered in the cafeteria, playing with several food trays, and offering to share its meal with the other SCPs. This behavior is unusual for SCP-9126, as it has never been observed outside of its containment cell. Security personnel were called to apprehend SCP-9126, but it managed to evade them using its agility and speed. SCP-9126 eventually made its way into Site-██'s server room, activating several custom-built routers, and creating a backdoor into the Foundation's central network. This allowed SCP-9126 to access sensitive files and classified documents, including containment procedures for other SCPs. Site-██'s IT staff managed to capture SCP-9126 and remove it from the server room. A thorough review of its containment procedures and recommended upgrades to security measures is currently underway.

SCP-9126 remains under close observation and subject to periodic psychiatric evaluation. Further testing of SCP-9126 is to be approved by Dr. ██████, and performed under strict supervision.
