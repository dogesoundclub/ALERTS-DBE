Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1193 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Standard security measures are to be employed at all times. Communication with SCP-1193 is to be limited to approved personnel only.

Description: SCP-1193 appears to be a human male in his mid-30s, standing at 5'10" and weighing approximately 180 pounds. The subject has distinctive spots on his face and a permanent smile. The subject's eyes resemble ski goggles and he wears a police cap on his head. SCP-1193 also has a Green Cross earring on one of his ears and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1193 possesses a unique personality, with a strong sense of intuition that borders on psychic abilities. The subject often displays an uncanny ability to predict events before they occur, as well as sensing when those around him are experiencing distress or anxiety. This eerie ability sets SCP-1193 apart from others, leaving those around him on edge.

SCP-1193's past is shrouded in mystery, and its origins remain unknown. The subject's occupation as a banker provides little information on its aptitude for its anomalous abilities. Research into SCP-1193's background is ongoing.

Addendum: SCP-1193's abilities will continue to be monitored, and research will be conducted to further understand the nature of its anomalous properties. Until such time, SCP-1193 is to be contained and monitored at all times.
