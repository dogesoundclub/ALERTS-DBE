Description: 

SCP-271, a female human of average height and weight, appears to be of Asian descent with her most notable feature being the vibrant orange stripes adorning her face. These stripes appear permanent and have no known cause or effect. She adorns normal glasses and is often found wearing a hoodie with a silver chain necklace and cigarette in hand.

Personality and Behaviour:

SCP-271 exhibits a predominantly nurturing and protective nature. They often display matronly behaviour towards anyone she forms a connection with, whether that be friends or family. This behaviour can sometimes extend to strangers, which has sometimes led to SCP-271 attempting to intervene in situations outside of her control. This inability to separate herself from others' issues has led to some comic situations.

Containment and Interaction:

SCP-271's abilities have not yet been assessed, but should be approached with caution. SCP-271 is cooperative and personable, likely due to the aforementioned nurturing nature. SCP Foundation personnel are urged to exercise caution and objectivity when interacting with SCP-271, as she has been known to adopt individuals and become possessive of them. 

Overall, SCP-271 is a unique individual with anomalous facial features, and its exact powers and/or limits remain unknown. Further study and interaction is recommended to better understand the full extent of SCP-271's capabilities.
