Item #: SCP-9311

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9311 is to be monitored on a daily basis, and is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Personnel are advised not to directly interact with SCP-9311 except for routine check-ups and in cases of emergency.

Description: SCP-9311 (also known as "Spots") is a female human with distinctive spots on her face and a purple lipstick. She has brown hair styled in a 90s fashion, and commonly wears a gold chain around her neck along with a gas mask for respiratory protection. SCP-9311 currently works as a fast food worker at [DATA EXPUNGED] , and has exhibited no abnormal behaviors in her workplace.

SCP-9311's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence, and a reluctance to ask for help even when needed. This trait can lead to some humorous situations, such as struggling to move heavy objects alone or refusing to use a map when lost. While SCP-9311 appears to be a normal human, it is possible that her unique physical features may be the result of anomalous properties.

Addendum: After initial interviews, SCP-9311 has stated that she has no knowledge of any anomalous abilities or events in her life. However, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of her distinct appearance and independence.
