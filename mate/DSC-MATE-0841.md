Item #: 841

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-841 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-███. Due to DSC-MATE-841's nature, it is to be provided with a small amount of luxury items on a monthly basis. Any attempts by DSC-MATE-841 to use its organizational skills to further its criminal activities are to be monitored and apprehended.

Description: DSC-MATE-841 is a male primate of the species Macaca, measuring at about 1.1 m in height and weighing approximately 30 kg. It possesses notable traits that set it apart from most members of its species, such as having a rich and varied vocabulary of several different languages, including but not limited to Japanese, Russian, and Italian. DSC-MATE-841 also has exceptional abilities in organization, strategy, and finance, with a predisposition towards criminal activities.

DSC-MATE-841's body is covered in dark gray fur, but its face anatomy is especially noteworthy. Its frightened mouth, coupled with its red clown eyes, give it an unnerving appearance. Its head is adorned with a fluorescent green mohawk and a single jade earring on its left ear. DSC-MATE-841 is typically seen wearing a red scarf, and an LED gas mask that covers its face—both ordinarily used to conceal its appearance to the public.

DSC-MATE-841 has a charismatic personality, and its ability to organize others into cohesive groups has allowed it to become the leader of a criminal organization. DSC-MATE-841 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility to its group, but it also has a great capacity for humor and fun, often leading to spontaneous bursts of catchy songs and dances.

Addendum: The Foundation initially acquired DSC-MATE-841 during a raid on an underground speakeasy owned by DSC-MATE-841. The Foundation was able to capture DSC-MATE-841 due to its strong sense of loyalty towards its comrades, which resulted in it voluntarily staying behind to allow the others to escape. Following containment, research reveals that DSC-MATE-841 had been involved in countless criminal activities, but to this day, no charges against it have been filed due to its extraordinary abilities and its capacity to evade capture from law enforcement.
