Item #: SCP-8643

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8643 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with standard amenities. SCP-8643 is not permitted access to any areas outside its designated cell without prior written consent from at least two Level-3 personnel.

SCP-8643 is to be monitored at all times through an internal surveillance system. Any deviations from standard behavior are to be reported immediately to supervisory staff.

Description: SCP-8643 is a human male of average build and height, appearing to be in his early 30s. SCP-8643's most notable physical features are his nerd glasses, blue bandana, and gold earring.

SCP-8643 exhibits a love for adventure, often seeking out new experiences and taking risks. This has resulted in several near-death experiences, some of which have been humorous in nature. SCP-8643 also has a tendency to smoke cigarettes and wear a gold chain around his neck.

SCP-8643's personality is largely outgoing and jovial, making him approachable and easy to talk to. However, SCP-8643 has demonstrated a disregard for authority and has been known to disregard instructions from superiors. SCP-8643's behavior and personality indicate that he may have been exposed to anomalous substances or objects, though no explicit evidence of such exposure has been found.

Addendum: In Incident 8643-A, SCP-8643 breached containment after accessing an unauthorized area of Site-██. SCP-8643 successfully evaded capture for several hours before being subdued by security personnel. Following a review of the incident, SCP-8643 was given a formal warning and informed that future breaches of containment would result in more severe disciplinary action.
