Item #: 439

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 439 is to be monitored closely and kept under surveillance at all times. Any attempt to contact or interact with the subject must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. The subject's public appearances are to be scheduled and controlled to avoid any potential safety risks or anomalous incidents.

Description: Subject 439 appears to be a humanoid female with distinctive orange stripes on her face. She is usually seen wearing a headset with LED lights and a silver chain around her neck. Her forehead is adorned with a two-color band and a goggle on her forehead.

Subject 439 is a highly charismatic and influential politician known for her exceptional public speaking skills and compassionate personality. She has shown to possess an uncanny ability to sense people's emotions and empathize with them, often taking on their problems as her own.

While her empathy and caring nature make her highly respected, it also poses a significant risk. Subject 439's altruistic tendencies can sometimes make her susceptible to manipulation or exploitation by those who wish to take advantage of her.

Addendum: Subject 439's anomalous abilities have yet to be fully understood. Several reports suggest that she may possess some form of mind-reading or telepathic abilities, but further testing is required to confirm these claims. Until then, extreme caution must be exercised when interacting with the subject.
