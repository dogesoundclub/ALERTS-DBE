Item #: SCP-6291

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6291 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with environmental enrichment items suitable for their species. Their daily routines and schedules are to be strictly maintained, and any changes in their surroundings must be introduced gradually to prevent undue stress. An armed security detail is to accompany SCP-6291 at all times due to their occupation as an armed police officer.

Description: SCP-6291 is a male monkey of unknown species with red clown eyes, and a pink, parted head crowned with goggles. They are always seen wearing a silver chain, which they claim contains a special charm that helps them focus during difficult situations.

SCP-6291 displays remarkable organizational skills and has been noted to be reliable in their work as a police officer. However, they can be stubborn and resistant to change, which has led to several humorous incidents when introduced to new ideas or challenges.

SCP-6291's containment is considered particularly challenging due to their occupation, which necessitates frequent contact with the public. It has been noted that SCP-6291 enjoys the attention and adoration they receive from their fans, but may act with unnecessary force when criticized or questioned.

SCP-6291's mental faculties appear to be at the average level for a monkey, but their proficiency with weapons and ability to follow orders make them a valuable asset to the Foundation.

Addendum: SCP-6291 was recruited by the Foundation after they were found responsible for the arrest of several anomalous entities that were threatening public safety. Since then, they have proven to be loyal and useful ally in containing and studying other anomalies. However, care must be taken to ensure SCP-6291 does not become complacent or too zealous in their duties.
