Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5922 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Interactions with DSC-MATE-5922 must be conducted only by personnel with Level 2 security clearance and above. Access to DSC-MATE-5922's legal services is strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-5922 is a human male of unknown age, appearing to be in his early thirties. He wears a purple cap with a headset and a silver chain around his neck. DSC-MATE-5922's eyes are obscured by normal glasses, while his most striking feature is his constant smile.

DSC-MATE-5922 works as a lawyer and is known to be a competent and successful practitioner of law. However, personnel are warned not to engage DSC-MATE-5922's services under any circumstances, as it has been observed that DSC-MATE-5922 can become fiercely loyal and protective of his clients. This can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations.

DSC-MATE-5922 has demonstrated a laid-back and easy-going demeanor in most situations. However, DSC-MATE-5922's strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness can lead to humorous situations, such as getting into a heated argument with someone who insults a friend or family member.

DSC-MATE-5922's origins and motives are currently unknown. However, it is suspected that DSC-MATE-5922 has anomalous properties that have not yet been identified. Research into DSC-MATE-5922 is ongoing.

Addendum: Experiment Log 5922-1

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-5922 was asked to defend D-████ in a mock court trial. DSC-MATE-5922 accepted the case, and his performance was deemed outstanding. However, at the end of the trial, DSC-MATE-5922 refused to allow D-████ to be sent back to their cell, citing their 'innocence' and 'a miscarriage of justice.'

DSC-MATE-5922 then used his legal and persuasive abilities to convince Site-██ personnel to allow D-████ to be released from custody. Security footage shows DSC-MATE-5922 morphing into a form of unknown origin before engaging in conversation with personnel.

Further investigation into DSC-MATE-5922 is required to understand the nature and extent of its anomalous abilities.
