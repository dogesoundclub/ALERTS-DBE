Item #: SCP-5431

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5431 is to be kept under constant surveillance and is not permitted to leave her designated containment chamber without permission from at least two Level 4 personnel. All communication with SCP-5431 must be recorded and monitored at all times. SCP-5431 must be provided with a supply of cigarettes as a means of keeping her cooperative.

Description: SCP-5431 is a female human with the distinct feature of spots on her face and a smiling expression. SCP-5431's most notable characteristic is her jade LED eyes, which appear to be implanted or surgically modified. Her head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap, and she wears a red cross earring, a silver chain, and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-5431's personality is known to be rebellious, often testing boundaries and challenging authority. She has been observed purposely breaking rules and finding ways to bend them for amusement. Despite this behavior, she is cooperative with Foundation staff when provided with cigarettes.

SCP-5431's occupation is that of a politician, and it is believed that she has used her anomalous abilities to manipulate and influence those around her. She has exhibited a highly analytical and strategic mindset, making her a potential threat to global security.

Addendum: SCP-5431 was contained after a Foundation investigation into a string of unexplained political events led to her identification as a possible anomalous entity. Further investigation into her abilities and intentions is ongoing.
