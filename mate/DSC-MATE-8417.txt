Item #: 8417

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8417 is to be monitored at all times and is not allowed to interact with any anomalous or potentially dangerous objects. Any attempts to give gifts must be approved by a Level 3 researcher first. In the event of an emergency, subject 8417 is to be evacuated immediately.

Description: Subject 8417, also known as "The Real Estate Agent," is a human male of average height with unique facial features. His face is covered in spots and he has a permanent smile, which can make him appear untrustworthy to some. He often wears a short peak cap on his head and a jade earring on his left ear.

Subject 8417 wears normal glasses over his eyes, but also carries a normal gas mask as an accessory. He appears to be in good physical shape and is known for being an excellent gift-giver, thanks to his keen observational skills and attention to detail.

However, subject 8417 may become overly focused on giving the "perfect" gift, often agonizing over what to get someone for extended periods of time. This can lead to anxiety and stress, which may make him more susceptible to emotional manipulation.

Personnel are advised to approach subject 8417 with caution and always remain aware of his gift-giving tendencies. Any requests for gifts must be closely monitored by a Level 3 researcher to avoid any potential harm to the individual or the Foundation.

Addendum: Subject 8417 has expressed interest in working with SCP Foundation staff to aid in gift-giving during the holiday season. This request is currently under review by senior staff.
