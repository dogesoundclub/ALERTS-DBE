Item #: SCP-9124

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9124 is to be contained in a standard human containment cell in Site-██. SCP-9124 is allowed personal belongings, but any objects deemed as potential escape tools must be confiscated. Any communication from SCP-9124 is to be monitored by Site personnel.

Description: SCP-9124 is a humanoid entity identified as a female human, age 34. SCP-9124's distinguishing features include orange stripes on the face, blue clown eyes, green hair in a purple cap, and a red cross earring on each ear. SCP-9124 has a two-color band on the forehead and wears a silver chain as an accessory.

SCP-9124's occupation is a beautician, and she displays a bubbly personality towards others. However, SCP-9124 possesses a strong idealistic mindset and desires to make the world a better place by any means necessary, which often results in protests or boycotts of companies and causes that go against her values. It is suspected that SCP-9124 may have connections with several activist organizations.

SCP-9124 is capable of utilizing her beautician skills to alter her appearance, disguising herself to blend in with any given scenario. This has led to several potential containment breaches, as SCP-9124 has attempted to escape custody multiple times.
