SCP Foundation Containment Procedures:

SCP-64, also known as "The Fashion Daredevil," is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. No unnecessary items should be left inside SCP-64's cell, as they may entice the subject to take another risk. SCP-64 is allowed minimal interaction with SCP personnel to prevent any possibility of containment breach.

Description:

SCP-64 is a human male with orange stripe-like marks on his face and neck. These marks flush a vibrant orange color when SCP-64 is excited or engaged in any activity he perceives as adventurous. SCP-64 is often seen wearing a retro cap decorated with a red victory band and a medical mask that covers his mouth. SCP-64 also wears a gold chain, which he believes adds to his "daredevil" persona.

Personality:

SCP-64 possesses a strong sense of adventure that makes him prone to risk-taking behavior. The subject enjoys trying new things and may engage in dangerous activities, such as bungee jumping or exploring unknown territories. SCP-64 has an uncanny ability to survive near-death experiences, which he attributes to his love for adventure. SCP-64's adventurous personality can result in many humorous and entertaining stories. However, this personality trait also makes SCP-64 a potential hazard to himself and others. SCP personnel should keep a watchful eye on SCP-64's behavior and continually assess his containment measures. 

Additional Notes: 

SCP-64's risk-taking behavior and love for adventure can be attributed to a possible psychological disorder commonly known as "Sensation Seeking Personality." SCP-64's case of this disorder is more severe than typical cases, but it still falls within the spectrum. SCP-64 is aware of his disorder but chooses to embrace it as part of his fashion persona. SCP-64's disorder may result in uncontrollable behavior in certain situations, making containment essential.
