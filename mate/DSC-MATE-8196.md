Item #: 8196

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8196 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced cage for outdoor exercise. Two armed guards are to be posted outside the containment chamber at all times. DSC-MATE-8196’s cage is to be kept stocked with various toys and obstacle courses to allow for regular exercise.

DSC-MATE-8196 is not to be approached without proper protective gear, as its whistle has been known to cause increased heart rate and temporary blindness in those within a ten-meter radius. Any unauthorized access to DSC-MATE-8196 is to be met with immediate disciplinary action.

Description: DSC-MATE-8196 is an anomalous anthropomorphic rabbit standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. Its fur is not arranged green and it has a pair of ski goggles for eyes, and an earring made of jade in each ear. It also sports a thick gold chain around its neck, as well as a whistle that it frequently uses to communicate.

DSC-MATE-8196 displays a high level of energy and enthusiasm, often getting over-excited about various stimuli. While not inherently malevolent, its lack of self-control has resulted in a number of incidents, including the temporary disorientation and blindness of personnel unaware of its whistle’s effect.

DSC-MATE-8196 is known to display signs of intelligence, observing and learning from its environment, and even using simple tools to manipulate the objects within its chamber. It has also exhibited a level of strategic thinking, often creating elaborate escape plans that must be broken up by the containment team.

DSC-MATE-8196 is a formidable fighter, capable of moving with blinding speed and delivering powerful strikes with its legs. It is also capable of using its whistle to disorient and incapacitate potential threats.

Addendum: The Foundation has been unable to ascertain the origin of DSC-MATE-8196 or how it acquired its anomalous abilities. Until such a time as that information becomes available, containment procedures are to remain in place.
