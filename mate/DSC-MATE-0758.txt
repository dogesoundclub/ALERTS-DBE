Item #: SCP-758

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-758 is to be kept in a reinforced steel cage measuring no less than 4m by 4m. The cage walls must be made of at least 5cm thick steel and reinforced with titanium. SCP-758 is to be fed raw meat twice a day at precisely the same time each day. Any humans entering SCP-758's containment area must have a minimum of three armed guards and must wear full-body protective gear at all times.

Description: SCP-758 is a male tiger approximately 2.5m in length, with green hair and a purple cap on its head. SCP-758's ears are adorned with a gold earring, and it often wears a red scarf around its neck. SCP-758 also demonstrates distinctive human-like behavior, engaging in complex cognitive skills, such as advanced organizational strategies, goal setting, and strategic thinking that are uncommon among felines.

SCP-758 is a highly ambitious banker, known for its exceptional organizational skills, tactical creativity, and the ability to complete its goals, no matter the cost. Despite its innovative strategies, SCP-758 appears unapproachable and secretive, keeping to itself while focusing on work. However, SCP-758 is incredibly intelligent, with a capacity for abstract thinking and communicating in multiple human languages.

SCP-758 often takes on more than it can handle, a trait that has resulted in considerable cause for concern among the Foundation. SCP-758 puts in long hours at work, often pushing past physical and mental limitations. SCP-758 has been seen to behave erratically and can exhibit violent tendencies when under extreme pressure or threat.

SCP-758's unusual skills and behavior have led some researchers to believe that it has been affected by an unknown anomalous entity that grants it complex human-like skills. However, other researchers suggest that SCP-758's abilities may be purely natural, with no anomalous influence. Despite these debates, SCP-758 remains a high-value asset for the Foundation due to its unique abilities and potential applications.

SCP-758 is to be monitored at all times, with careful attention paid to any changes in its behavior or mental state. Any sudden changes in its behavior must be reported to the head researcher immediately for further analysis.
