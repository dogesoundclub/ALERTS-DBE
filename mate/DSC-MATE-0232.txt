Item #: SCP-232

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-232 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Personnel are not to make any physical contact with SCP-232 unless specifically authorized by the Site Director. Any individuals who have been in close proximity to SCP-232 are to undergo extensive psychological evaluations to determine if they have been affected by its anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-232 is a human male of approximately 40 years old. It stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 82 kilograms. SCP-232's most notable feature is its ski goggle eyes, which function normally and appear to be permanently affixed onto its face. Its head is prominently spiked, resembling a mountain peak at its center. On its left ear, SCP-232 wears a gold earring. SCP-232 is often observed wearing a red scarf, which it claims is a lucky talisman.

SCP-232 has a jovial personality and often interacts with individuals it comes into contact with affectionately. It is outgoing and possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility. SCP-232 takes its job as a car salesman extremely seriously and is often noted as being "the best in the business." Its ability to sell any vehicle to any person has resulted in SCP-232 being approached by various organizations seeking to use its persuasion skills for their own benefit.

When in a social situation, SCP-232 has been known to become the life of the party. It possesses an ability to get others to dance or sing along to its favorite songs, often leading to humorous situations. However, SCP-232's influence on others is not limited to social situations. Its persuasive abilities extend to any situation where it wishes to achieve a certain outcome, with reports of SCP-232 convincing Foundation personnel to provide it with additional privileges or exceptions to its containment procedures.

SCP-232's anomalous properties have not been fully understood, but it is believed that its ability to persuade individuals is not limited to verbal communication. It is suspected that there may be visual or pheromonal cues that SCP-232 emits to influence others' behavior. Further testing is necessary to fully understand the extent of SCP-232's anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-232 has requested that it be allowed to continue to sell cars to the public, stating that "everyone needs a good ride, and I'm the one who can make it happen." The request has been denied.
