Description: DSC-MATE-1916 is a female human of unknown age, working as a fast food employee at ██████ burger joint. DSC-MATE-1916 stands at an average height of 5'5" with spots on her face and clown red eyes, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a choker around her neck. She is frequently seen smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-1916 possesses remarkable observational skills and keen attention to details that make her an outstanding gift giver. However, her perfectionist tendencies lead her to spend an excessive amount of time searching for the "perfect" gift, often resulting in her becoming anxious and stressed. These traits have not been deemed hazardous to the Foundation and therefore have been designated as harmless.

DSC-MATE-1916 has shown no indication of awareness of her abnormality or the Foundation's existence, making her a low-risk humanoid anomaly. It is to be noted that subject's gift giving prowess could be beneficial to the Foundation in the future.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1916 has been noted to have excellent customer service skills, and her employment could be considered a job opportunity for other humanoids with a non-violent DSC classification. A proposal to the Ethics Committee is currently under review.
