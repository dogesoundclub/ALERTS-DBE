Item #: 8971

Object Class: Primordial

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8971 is to be confined to a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-███. The chamber must be equipped with standard amenities such as a bed, desk, and hygiene facilities. In addition, provisions should be made to cater to SCP-8971's dietary requirements.

SCP-8971 is not to be allowed any tools or implements that would assist in it triggering its anachronistic abilities. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-8971's powers, all staff are advised to limit direct contact with this entity at all times.

Description: SCP-8971 appears to be a primate specimen of indeterminate origin. At the time of containment, it was wearing a green hat pulled down over its hair, along with a pair of jade earrings.

SCP-8971 identifies as "Doctor", and exhibits traits associated with typical medical professionals such as a bedside disposition, fastidiousness, and curiosity.

At times, SCP-8971's mind wanders and it can become engrossed in its research to the point of distraction. This makes it prone to forget appointments, lose track of time, and miss important events. Casual observations suggest that this behavior may be linked to an underlying cognitive disorder, though no other unusual physical or mental aberrations have been noted.

Addendum: During routine chamber cleaning, Dr. ███ discovered SCP-8971 in a catatonic state, with its body progressively downgrading to a more primitive form. Despite strenuous efforts, no therapeutic interventions could revive SCP-8971, and it expired after several hours.

Subsequent analysis confirmed that SCP-8971 had been secretly fibbing about its true abilities, including its ability to traverse time and space. Ongoing studies are underway to establish whether SCP-8971's behavior was purposeful, an accident, or an effect of its cognitive disorder. End of report.
