SCP-1623 is a humanoid creature that has been classified as a potential anomaly by the SCP foundation. It appears to be a female car salesman with orange stripes on its face and VR rainbow LED eyes. The creature wears a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring, accompanied by a silver chain accessory.

SCP-1623's personality is characterized by its extremely empathetic and compassionate nature. While these qualities may seem admirable, they can also lead the creature to take on the problems of others and feel responsible for the well-being of those around them. This may cause SCP-1623 to become exhausted and overwhelmed, leading to potential issues that must be carefully monitored and addressed by the SCP foundation.

Further research is needed to fully understand SCP-1623 and its potential anomalous properties. Until then, the creature must be handled with caution and monitored closely by SCP foundation personnel.
