Item #: 9411

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9411 is currently employed as a real estate agent and must maintain a stable job to prevent suspicion from the public. Their movements will be monitored closely by Mobile Task Force squads to ensure their behavior does not pose a risk of breaching the veil of secrecy that governs our world. Daily cognitive as well as physical therapy sessions must be conducted to ensure that any anomalous behavior or ability is kept under control.

Description: Subject 9411 is a female human with orange stripes on their face as well as blue clown eyes. The subject's head is short and sharp, much like a witch. They also possess green cross earrings, a silver chain, and an LED gas mask.

The subject holds a natural talent for leadership and regularly takes charge of any situation they encounter. This ability is not currently understood in the context of the anomalous, but further observation is needed. The subject's personality enables them to inspire others to follow their lead, and combined with their apparent drive to succeed, may result in any experience that the subject leads will be successful.

However, the subject's true potential for leadership and authority has not been fully investigated, and thus, we cannot be sure about its significance.

Addendum: An investigation is to be conducted on any friends and family members of 9411. It has come to our attention that they may be involved with a potentially anomalous entity. If any evidence is found, containment procedures will be updated accordingly.
