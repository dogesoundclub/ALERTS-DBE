Item #: SCP-3315

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3315 is to be located in a cell designed to resemble their personal fashion studio. All personnel interacting with SCP-3315 are required to wear standard gas masks at all times.

Description: SCP-3315 is a human female of undetermined age, with pig tails on either side of their head. SCP-3315 is often seen wearing a pair of normal glasses, a gold chain necklace, and gold earrings. Of particular note is SCP-3315's propensity to don a normal gas mask as an accessory. SCP-3315's primary job is that of a fashion designer, and they often speak at a pace that is reflective of their energetic and enthusiastic character.

SCP-3315 possesses a unique ability to manipulate other individuals' emotions and imbue them with a deep sense of excitement and enthusiasm. This ability has led to some humorous situations, in which SCP-3315 becomes overly excited about something that others do not share the same level of interest in. When SCP-3315 exerts their effect, subjects become highly emotional and may express a range of intense emotions, including joy, euphoria, and excitement.

SCP-3315's anomalous properties were only discovered after reports began surfacing of crowds of people flocking to SCP-3315's fashion shows. Foundation personnel became involved when individuals who had been in close proximity to SCP-3315 began displaying symptoms of extreme emotional distress.

SCP-3315 is currently under observation to better understand its abilities and the impact it could have on the general population of humans. Future testing will explore the extent of SCP-3315's abilities and the potential use of them in Foundation operations.
