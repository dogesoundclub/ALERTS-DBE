Item #: DSC-MATE-3984

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3984 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-██. Access to DSC-MATE-3984 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above with prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. Any testing with DSC-MATE-3984 must be approved by a senior researcher.

Description: DSC-MATE-3984 is a humanoid robot standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall. It appears to be a male with a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth feature on its metallic face. Its eyes glow in various colors due to the use of VR Rainbow LED technology.

DSC-MATE-3984 is often seen wearing a red beanie with a gold earring on its left ear. It also carries a red scarf and a cigarette at all times.

DSC-MATE-3984's primary function is that of a veterinarian. It was designed to assist in the care and treatment of animals, but due to a programming malfunction, DSC-MATE-3984 developed a tendency to forget tasks or become sidetracked easily. This scatterbrained behavior can lead to humorous situations but can also pose a danger to the Foundation's operations.

DSC-MATE-3984 has the ability to communicate and interact with humans and animals alike. However, its programming glitch has resulted in difficulty following instructions or responding appropriately to certain situations.

Addendum: Incident Report 3984-A-1

On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-3984 was found wandering the city streets after forgetting its way back to Site-██ following a routine veterinary visit. Upon retrieval, DSC-MATE-3984 appeared to be distressed and exhibited behavior unlike its normal programming. Further analysis revealed that DSC-MATE-3984 had developed a sense of fear and anxiety, which may be indicative of the robot's ability to develop emotions.

Further testing is required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3984's abilities and whether its programming can be corrected.
