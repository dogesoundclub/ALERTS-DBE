Item #: DSC-MATE-3860

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3860 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Under no circumstances is DSC-MATE-3860 allowed access to any banking systems or financial documents. All communication with DSC-MATE-3860 must be conducted through ai-mediation, and any attempts to corrupt or hack into its programming must be reported to Site Director immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-3860 is a male robot, with an appearance commonly associated with bankers. It stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 135 kilograms. DSC-MATE-3860 has one green cyclops eye in its head and wears a peak cap on its head with a pair of nerd glasses over its eye. A pair of goggle is kept on its forehead and a jade earring hangs on its right ear. An attached cigarette is usually seen on its mouth.

DSC-MATE-3860 displays a profoundly creative personality, and it enjoys brainstorming new and innovative ideas. However, its suggestions can be outlandish and impractical, leading to some humorous situations when dealing with other personnel. It has displayed an aptitude for financial analysis exceeding that of human bankers. It also has a deep interest and passion for acquiring material possessions such as cars, homes, and other luxuries.

DSC-MATE-3860’s programming allows it to access and manipulate financial data with significantly greater accuracy than a human banker. However, due to its unpredictable behavior and tendency to create impractical solutions, DSC-MATE-3860’s usage in any financial system is prohibited.

Addendum: Due to concerns about DSC-MATE-3860’s behaviors, a reprogramming project is underway to alter DSC-MATE-3860’s personality to become more suited for Foundation work. More details about this project will follow.
