Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8454 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject may be provided with toys and puzzles for entertainment purposes. Access to dangerous activities such as bungee jumping, wilderness exploration or other activities deemed potentially hazardous are strictly prohibited. Security is to be maintained at all times.

Description: Subject 8454 is a male monkey species typically found in the tropical regions of South America. The subject presents a pair of normal glasses over its eyes and a police cap that contains a goggle on its forehead. The monkey's mouth is always frighteningly opened, as if it's about to shriek or howl, providing a scary appearance. One band with two colors graces its forehead, and the left ear has a gold earring. It carries two accessories with it always: a silver chain and a candy stick. 

Subject 8454 possesses a personality that is adventurous, enthusiastic, and may enjoy taking risks, trying new things. It can lead to some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. There are no reports of any additional anomalies or abilities attributed to the subject at this time.

Addendum: Subject 8454 had been recently discovered as the manager of a decrepit theater that had been abandoned for years. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the monkey had been running the establishment for some time with no prior detection. The venue was found to have been hosting additional anomalous entities during certain performances. The Foundation has acquired the property and put a stop to the anomalous activities. The subject was then collected and contained.
