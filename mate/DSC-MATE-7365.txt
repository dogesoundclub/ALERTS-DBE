Subject 7365 is a human male with striking red clown eyes that seem to shine in the darkness, as if constantly illuminated by some ethereal force. His head is adorned with a vibrant mohawk that screams of individuality and rebellion. One can readily observe a two-color band adorning his forehead, the purpose of which remains obscure. Green cross earrings dangle from his ears, adding an eccentric flair to his appearance.

Subject 7365 is a beautician by trade, but his ingenuity and inventiveness go far beyond the beauty industry. He takes a practical and hands-on approach to problem-solving, often using unconventional methods to fix broken objects. With ingenuity akin to that of SCP-914, he employs duct tape and paper clips to restore order to even the most damaged objects.

He favors a gold chain around his neck that complements his typically torn and tattered clothing. The cigarette that hangs from the corner of his mouth seems to be another regular fixture of his appearance. Subject 7365's personality is one of the most intriguing aspects of his character. He is highly resourceful but often takes risks that others might shy away from to achieve his goals.

In summary, Subject 7365 exhibits a mix of eccentricity, resourcefulness, and individuality that sets him apart from the average person. Although there is nothing overtly threatening about him, there is a sense that he is always thinking outside the box and will stop at nothing to achieve his goals - a personality trait that makes him a valuable asset in any team, but also an unpredictable one.
