SCP-544, also known as "The Tiger Car Salesman," is a sentient, anthropomorphic tiger who works as a car salesman in an undisclosed location. His eyes resemble ski goggles, and he often wears a red beanie as his signature headwear. Additionally, he is known to wear a red scarf and continuously have a cigarette in his mouth.

Despite his professional appearance, SCP-544 has a brash and spontaneous personality that can sometimes lead to reckless behavior, causing amusing mishaps and scrape-ups with the people around him. The SCP Foundation discovered him after witness testimonies and surveillance footage revealed that he has an unusual ability to sell cars with incredible ease.

SCP-544's species remains unknown and is a subject of ongoing research within the foundation. He has so far shown no aggressive behavior towards staff, but it is recommended that he not be unleashed in public without proper supervision to prevent any unwanted attention that might compromise foundation secrecy.
