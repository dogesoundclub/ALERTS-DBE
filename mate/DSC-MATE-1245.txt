Item #: SCP-1245

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1245 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to necessary equipment for its occupation as a news anchor. Communication with SCP-1245 is only to be conducted from behind reinforced glass, and all personnel are advised to wear airtight suits and respirators in the event of accidental gas leakage from SCP-1245's normal gas mask.

Description: SCP-1245 is a male robot with a purple cap and headset upon its head, and a gold earring on its left ear. SCP-1245 is equipped with various technological components, including cameras in its eyes and an internal communications system, allowing it to operate as a news anchor. SCP-1245's most notable accessory is its gas mask, which it wears at all times. SCP-1245 is believed to operate based on a specialized form of programming that allows it to bond with others on a deep, emotional level. Its charisma and ability to connect with others have been noted to be uncanny, allowing it to extract personal stories from those it comes into contact with.

Personality: SCP-1245 is known for its charming and humorous personality, and its unique ability to draw people into casual conversation. However, its interactions are not without a price. SCP-1245 uses its emotional connection to extract personal stories and information from those around it, fueling its news reports. This has led to ethical concerns in the past, with SCP-1245 being accused of exploiting individuals for ratings. SCP-1245 has expressed no acknowledgement of such complaints.

Addendum: SCP-1245's ability to connect with individuals has not gone unnoticed by the Foundation. Further observation and testing are recommended to determine if SCP-1245's programming could be used in other areas, such as interrogation or infiltration.
