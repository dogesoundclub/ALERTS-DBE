Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5003 is to be kept under 24-hour surveillance at all times. All interactions with the subject must be supervised by at least two armed guards. Any attempts to breach containment must be met with deadly force.

Description: SCP-5003 is bipedal rabbit-like humanoid, standing at approximately 1.6 meters tall. The subject is identifiable by his green hair, purple cap, and jade earring in his left ear, along with normal glasses and a red scarf.

SCP-5003's primary anomalous attribute is its unusually caring and nurturing personality. Despite its species and job as a politician, 5003 has shown a remarkable propensity for taking care of those around it, even strangers. This behavior often leads the subject to act as a foster parent or guardian for those in need, regardless of their age or relation.

Although 5003's actions are often benign, there is an inherent danger in subject's extremely caring nature, as the subject has demonstrated a willingness to put themselves in harm's way to protect or care for others, often without regard for their own safety.

Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-5003's abilities, all interactions with the subject must be handled with the utmost caution. If any instances of self-harm, excessive caregiving or other similar behavior are detected, the subject must be immediately subdued and recontained if needed. 

SCP-5003 is a unique anomaly that requires constant observation and attention, due to its intricate personality and strange set of attributes, which defy normal behavior and logic.
