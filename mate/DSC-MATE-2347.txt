Item #: 2347

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2347 ("The Clown Reporter") is to be contained at all times within Site-██ in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber must be equipped with a soundproofed radio and should be monitored by at least two armed guards at all times. Access to Subject 2347 is limited to Level 2 personnel and above, and interactions with subject must be kept strictly professional at all times. 

Description: Subject 2347 is a humanoid male, appearing to be in his late 30s, with multiple spots covering his face and a clown mouth painted on his lips. Additionally, subject 2347 possesses blue clown-like eyes and wears a purple cap fitted with a headset. Subject 2347 exhibits a great sense of humor, often utilizing it to disarm others and make them more comfortable around him. 

With a natural talent for storytelling and impressions, subject 2347 is perfectly suited for his job as a reporter. The subject's humor, however, can be unpredictable and may border on inappropriate, especially when dealing with sensitive or emotionally charged topics. 

Subject 2347 has shown no signs of anomalous abilities or properties in standard testing, and his presence alone poses no risk to Foundation operations. However, due to his peculiar appearance and personality, the subject must be contained to ensure that he does not draw attention to the Foundation. 

Addendum: Subject 2347 has shown a somewhat unusual level of affection towards his containment guards, often hugging or high-fiving them upon arrival or departure. This behavior has been deemed harmless but is to be monitored closely.
