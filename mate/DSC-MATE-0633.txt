SCP File #633 â€“ "The Rainbow Realtor"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-633 is currently employed as a real estate agent with a local firm. Due to the nature of their job, no special containment procedures are required at this time. However, personnel must avoid engaging in extended conversations with SCP-633, as they may become overly attached to the individual and their possessions.

Description: SCP-633 appears as a female human with distinct spot markings on their face. They possess an unnaturally large smile and have striking orange eyebrows which contrast with their multicolored hair styled similarly to individuals typically seen at music festivals. SCP-633 is often seen wearing a velvet choker, which they claim brings them good luck.

Personality-wise, SCP-633 is extremely caring and nurturing, and this extends to every object they possess. This abnormal behavior makes SCP-633 susceptible to attachment and anthropomorphizing every object they encounter. Some known examples include naming their car and talking to plants.

Addendum: SCP-633 has been tasked with selling a local property that has long-standing ties to paranormal activity. Upon visiting, SCP-633 became anxious and uncharacteristically withdrawn as if, for the first time, encountering genuine objects of the supernatural. More tests of this nature may be forthcoming.
