Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6695 is to be kept in a secure, standard humanoid containment chamber. Only personnel with Level 2 security clearance are allowed to enter SCP-6695's chamber. SCP-6695 is to be fed a diet consisting of fresh vegetables and fruits twice a day. Any physical contact with SCP-6695 is strictly prohibited, as it has been observed to become frightened and panicked when confronted by people.

Description: SCP-6695 is a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and horned rim glasses. Its head is covered by a blue bandana, and it wears a gold chain around its neck. SCP-6695 is also equipped with a normal gas mask, which it wears at all times.

SCP-6695 has a spontaneous and risk-taking personality, often taking impulsive actions that can lead to humorous situations. SCP-6695 has been observed to enjoy jumping off cliffs into lakes or rivers, despite the danger involved.

SCP-6695's anomalous properties manifest when it is placed in a stressful or dangerous situation. When threatened, SCP-6695 releases a high-pitched scream that can incapacitate anyone within a 10-meter radius. It is unclear what causes this scream.

SCP-6695 has shown no signs of aggressive behavior, but its fear and panic can make it difficult to control. It is recommended that SCP-6695 be handled with caution and kept away from stressful situations. In the event of a containment breach, personnel are advised to remain calm and avoid making sudden movements in SCP-6695's presence.
