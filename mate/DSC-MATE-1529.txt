Item #: SCP-1529

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1529 is to be stationed in a monitored apartment complex in downtown Toronto. Any unauthorized visitors are to be immediately reported and escorted off the premises. SCP-1529 is to be escorted to and from work by Foundation agents in order to ensure minimal disruption to the local population.

Description: SCP-1529 appears to be a male tiger of unknown subspecies, possessing a distinctive red beanie on its head and ski goggle eyes. SCP-1529's mouth is perpetually open in a distinctly frightened expression. The creature wears a gold earring in each of its two ears, as well as a gold chain around its neck. SCP-1529's physical appearance does not vary, despite external influences.

SCP-1529 has proven to possess a remarkable insight into current events, and as such, has been appointed as the host for a nightly news segment. The creature has displayed a strong sense of independence, as well as stubbornness, which can lead to difficulties in creature management.

SCP-1529 has the ability to communicate in English, though it has not revealed details about its origins or how it came to possess this ability. Despite its fearsome appearance, SCP-1529 has not been observed to exhibit any signs of aggression.

Addendum: While SCP-1529 appears to have little regard for its own safety, it has been noted that the creature has proven to be highly valuable in physical altercation situations. SCP-1529's strength and dexterity have been noted to be far beyond that of ordinary tigers. Care must be taken not to threaten SCP-1529 or it may react with violent behavior.
