Item #: SCP-7248

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7248 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, modified to accommodate its large size. The chamber must be kept clean and well-stocked with fresh meat and water.

SCP-7248 is to be monitored at all times by a team of Level 3 personnel. Any instances of abnormal behavior or physical changes should be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7248 is a male tiger of indeterminate age, approximately 2 meters in length and weighing 500 kilograms. It is distinguishable by its gold earring and silver chain, as well as the whistle it carries on a leather cord around its neck.

Despite its animalistic appearance, SCP-7248 is capable of speech and possesses human-like intelligence. It is employed as a firefighter in [REDACTED], and displays a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to its job. However, SCP-7248 also has a playful side and enjoys sharing jokes and stories passed down through its family or community.

SCP-7248 values tradition and is often seen wearing ornate clothing and accessories. It has been observed performing rituals and ceremonies that appear to be of cultural significance to its species.

SCP-7248's physical abilities are enhanced beyond those of a typical tiger. It has been seen leaping great distances and carrying heavy weights with ease. Its claws and teeth are also sharper and stronger than a natural tiger's.

Addendum: SCP-7248 was recovered from a [REDACTED] circus in 20██, where it was performing tricks and stunts for audiences. Foundation agents were alerted to its anomalous properties when it spoke to a handler in full sentences. The circus was shut down and SCP-7248 was brought into Foundation custody for containment and study.
