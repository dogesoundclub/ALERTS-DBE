Item #: SCP-7113

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7113 is to be kept in permanent containment at Site-19 for the duration of its existence on this plane of existence. SCP-7113 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell and is to be monitored at all times for any changes in behavior. SCP-7113 is allowed one hour of recreational time per day and is permitted to read books on leadership and management.

Description: SCP-7113 is a human male with a mohawk hairstyle and a jade earring in their left ear. SCP-7113 often wears a silver chain around their neck as an accessory. SCP-7113 appears to be in their mid-thirties and works as a car salesman in the greater metropolitan area. 

SCP-7113 displays signs of constant fear and keeps their mouth covered with a medical mask at all times. SCP-7113 has normal glasses resting on the bridge of their nose and their mouth remains slightly agape, as if in a state of constant fright. Despite their fearful demeanor, SCP-7113 has a natural talent for leadership and often finds themselves taking charge of situations, whether it's at work, in a social group, or even in their personal life. 

SCP-7113's abilities make it a valuable asset to the Foundation in the event of leadership crises or incidents requiring decisive action. However, it should be kept in mind that SCP-7113's current state of mind is in a constant state of anxiety and utmost caution must be taken when utilizing their abilities.

Addendum: It is suggested that SCP-7113 be provided with additional resources, such as psychiatric evaluation and therapy, to assist them in overcoming their anxiety and fears. However, due to the unforeseen side effects that these resources may have on their leadership abilities, implementation must be carefully considered before being put into action.
