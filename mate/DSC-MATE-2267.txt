Item #: 2267

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2267, also known as the "Golden Mafia Boss", must be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. Due to their ability to manipulate precious metals, all metallic objects within the containment chamber must be non-precious materials.

Description: Subject 2267 appears to be a male rabbit, with their entire body covered in golden fur. Their retro cap and gold chain suggest a fondness for the aesthetic of the mafia. They wear an LED gas mask that glows with an eerie light, obscuring their frightened mouth.

Subject 2267 possesses an extraordinary gift-giving ability. They are incredibly observant and attentive to details, which they utilize to select the perfect gift for their recipients. However, this attention to detail sometimes verges on obsession, causing them to spend an excessive amount of time agonizing over the perfect present. 

It is unknown how Subject 2267 gained their gift-giving ability, but it can potentially result in disastrous consequences if left unchecked. Their obsession for perfection can lead them to manipulate and control the behavior of individuals they gift to, making them a dangerous and unpredictable entity in the criminal underworld. 

Notes: Subject 2267 must be monitored at all times for signs of increased agitation, particularly during the holiday season. Any signs of gift-giving behavior that could lead to manipulation or harm must be reported immediately to the appropriate authorities.
