Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2519 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell located in Site-19. Access to SCP-2519 requires Level 2 clearance and must be granted by at least 2 Level 3 personnel. Any interaction with SCP-2519 must be documented and filed accordingly.

Description: SCP-2519 is a male human identified as a doctor. The subject has numerous spots on their face, with blue clown eyes and a bucket hat covering their head. SCP-2519 also has a red victory band and a goggle on their forehead, with a jade earring and a gold chain as additional accessories. Despite their unusual appearance, SCP-2519 is non-anomalous and presents no immediate danger to personnel.

SCP-2519's personality is characterized by a dry sense of humor, often catching people off guard with their deadpan jokes. While not the life of the party, SCP-2519's humor provides a surprisingly humorous and entertaining quality to their presence.

Addendum: SCP-2519 has provided invaluable medical assistance to Foundation personnel in various situations, demonstrating proficiency in emergency care and advanced medical procedures. However, SCP-2519 has expressed a desire to have more direct involvement in Foundation operations, particularly those related to anomalies affecting the human body. Request for additional involvement is currently under review.
