Special Containment Procedures:
DSC-MATE-470, also known as "The Tiger Car Salesman," is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The subject is to receive regular medical check-ups and be monitored for any signs of abnormal behavior or physical changes. Any visitations by family or friends must be approved by Site Director.

Description:
DSC-MATE-470 is a male, anthropomorphic tiger with brown fur and black stripes. The subject wears a hoodie over his head, which conceals his ears, and normal glasses over his amber-colored eyes. DSC-MATE-470 is always seen wearing a red scarf around his neck as an accessory.

Personality:
DSC-MATE-470 displays affectionate behavior towards individuals in his vicinity, frequently caring for friends and family members as if they were his own children. This behavior has been observed to extend to staff members, often making them feel comforted and appreciated. DSC-MATE-470 is generally calm and cooperative with staff members, although he may occasionally display defensive behavior, particularly when witnessing mistreatment or cruelty towards others.

History:
DSC-MATE-470's origins are unknown. However, the subject was first discovered when he applied to a local car dealership, presenting himself as a salesperson, and was observed using anthropomorphic abilities to sell cars to unsuspecting customers. DSC-MATE-470 was detained and transferred to this facility for study and containment.

Potential Risk and Benefits:
DSC-MATE-470's abilities have not yet been fully ascertained, but it is believed that the subject's care-giving nature may have potential benefits in a therapeutic environment. However, DSC-MATE-470 should be regarded as a potentially dangerous entity, largely due to his physical strength and endangerment posed towards human life.

Conclusion:
DSC-MATE-470 is an unusual sapient being with the potential for both a risk and benefit. We suggest that the DSC commission further research in the potential benefits of his ability; however, it is also imperative to remember that it must be treated with caution and respect.
