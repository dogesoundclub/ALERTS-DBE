Item #: DSC-MATE-4282

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4282 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Due to its nature as a firefighter, DSC-MATE-4282 is granted permission to leave its containment chamber for the purpose of active duty. During such instances, DSC-MATE-4282 is to always be accompanied by no less than two armed security personnel for both its safety and the safety of any civilians within its immediate vicinity.

Description: DSC-MATE-4282 is a male tiger designated as "Firefighter 4282." DSC-MATE-4282 wears a blue bandana over its head, a gold earring in its left ear, and a red scarf around its neck. DSC-MATE-4282's physical appearance is mostly similar to that of a Bengal tiger, with the exception of a few scars on different parts of its body, likely from previous firefighting missions.

DSC-MATE-4282 is capable of limited speech in both English and [REDACTED], though it primarily communicates through roars, growls, and other feline vocalizations. DSC-MATE-4282 shows a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often putting itself in danger to save others. This behavior has resulted in DSC-MATE-4282 taking on more than it can handle at times, leading to humorous situations such as being unable to fit all of its tasks in a single day or attempting to carry too many objects at once.

DSC-MATE-4282's anomalous abilities manifest in its ability to generate flames and manipulate fire to a certain degree, particularly during combat situations. DSC-MATE-4282 is also immune to the harmful effects of fire, such as burns or smoke inhalation. DSC-MATE-4282's ability to generate and control fire is limited to when it is on active duty as a firefighter, likely due to the psychologically ingrained association of its abilities with its occupation.

Additional Notes: DSC-MATE-4282 has shown no signs of hostility or malicious intent towards Foundation personnel and generally cooperates during containment measures. DSC-MATE-4282 has even been recorded organizing impromptu firefighting drills with Foundation personnel during its designated time outside of containment. As such, DSC-MATE-4282 has been granted Safe classification.
