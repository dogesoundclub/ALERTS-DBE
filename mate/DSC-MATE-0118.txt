SCP-118, also known as "The Lawyer," is a humanoid entity that appears to be a middle-aged woman. Her most noticeable feature is the pattern of spots on her skin, which resemble the markings of a leopard. She also has distinctive orange eyebrows and wears a headset with LED lights, which she uses to communicate with her legal clients.

Despite her professional demeanor, SCP-118 has a fun-loving personality that can be surprising to those who only see her in the courtroom. She takes her job as a lawyer seriously, and has a strong sense of duty and responsibility to her clients. At the same time, however, she knows how to let loose on the dance floor, often surprising others with her dance moves and silly antics.

SCP-118 has been known to wear a gold chain as an accessory, which may hold some sentimental value to her. Additionally, she keeps a pair of goggles on her forehead, which she may use in situations requiring vision protection.

It is currently unknown how SCP-118 gained her unique appearance or abilities. However, she has proven to be a capable and valuable asset to the Foundation, particularly in legal matters related to the containment of anomalous entities.
