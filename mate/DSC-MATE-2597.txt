Item #: 2597

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2597 is to be allowed freedom of movement provided they do not pose a threat to Foundation objectives. Due to their position as a train driver, they must periodically undergo psychological evaluations to ensure they remain cooperative and sane. Any perceived deviation from cooperative or sane behavior should be reported to the appropriate personnel for further assessment.

Description: SCP-2597 is a female human of above-average height and weight, with bright red clown eyes and green hair in a purple cap. The forehead features two color bands and they wear a choker and smoke cigarettes on occasion. Despite their unusual physical features, SCP-2597 is capable of blending in with humans with moderate success when not drawing attention to themselves.

SCP-2597 possesses a strong and decisive personality, always seeking to get the job done efficiently and effectively. This often comes across as bossy or intimidating to those who do not know them well, but they are generally cooperative with those who prove themselves capable in their eyes. SCP-2597 is a train driver by trade, and their work provides them with an appropriate outlet for their need for order and control.

Addendum: SCP-2597 has shown resistance to minor anomalous effects observed during Foundation activities, suggesting a potentially useful candidate for more hazardous missions. Further assessment and testing required.
