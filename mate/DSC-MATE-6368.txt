All communication with SCP-6368 must be recorded and reviewed by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-6368 is not to be exposed to any unexpected changes or challenges unless deemed necessary for research purposes.

Description: SCP-6368 is a female human, approximately 38 years old, and stands 5'6" in height. SCP-6368's face is adorned with spotted markings, and they have a unique feature of red clown eyes. Their head is short and styled in a witch-like manner.

SCP-6368 is frequently found wearing a choker and a green cross earring. They work as a car salesman, and their personality is described as reliable and organized, yet stubborn when it comes to accepting new ideas or letting go of routines. 

Incident Log 6368-A: During a routine interview, SCP-6368 was exposed to an unanticipated change in their schedule and exhibited severe distress. They refused to leave their cell for several days and became increasingly aggressive towards researchers attempting to communicate with them.

Incident Log 6368-B: SCP-6368 was given a task outside of their usual routine, and upon completion, expressed a sense of satisfaction and reported feeling accomplished. However, SCP-6368 subsequently demanded additional tasks of similar nature, and when denied this request, began exhibiting hostile behavior.

Further research is needed to determine the source of SCP-6368's fixation on routine and their ability to adapt to change.
