Item #: 1988

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1988 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with no notable limitations or restrictions. Any attempts to restrict or impede subject 1988's movements or personal freedoms have been deemed unnecessary by Foundation research personnel.

Description: Subject 1988 is a female human of indeterminate age and ethnicity, standing at approximately 5'6" tall with a slim frame. The subject's most notable feature is their constant smile, which is both engaging and somewhat unnerving. Subject 1988's cybereyes are of the VR Jade LED model, allowing them to access and process large amounts of visual data at remarkable speeds.

Subject 1988's head appears to be adorned with a variety of rainbow-themed hair decorations, suggesting they are either part of or sympathetic to the LGBTQ+ community. The subject is often seen with a cigarette, though it is unclear whether they are a heavy smoker or simply use the cigarette as a calming mechanism.

Perhaps most intriguingly, subject 1988 possesses an uncanny sense of intuition that borders on psychic ability. They can seemingly predict events before they occur and often exhibit an almost supernatural ability to sense the emotions and state of mind of those around them. This has made them a valuable asset in a number of investigations and operations, though it may also suggest that they are harboring some as-yet-unknown anomalous properties.

Addendum: Research into subject 1988's abilities is ongoing, and it is recommended that they be monitored closely for any indications of further anomalous traits or activities. Any and all information regarding the subject's history or background is to be treated as a high-priority research target.
