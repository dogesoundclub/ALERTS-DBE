Description: DSC-MATE-189 is a male monkey with red clown eyes. DSC-MATE-189 has a retro cap on its head and a two-color band on its forehead. It is also adorned with a gold earring in each ear and a gold chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-189 exhibits a natural talent for leadership and often takes charge of situations.

DSC-MATE-189 is able to speak and understands several languages, including English, Spanish, and French. DSC-MATE-189 has claimed to hold a Doctorate in medicine, although no records to support this claim have been found. DSC-MATE-189 has displayed the ability to diagnose illnesses and injuries in other DSC subjects and non-anomalous individuals, seemingly using its own natural senses.

DSC-MATE-189's personality is domineering and confident. DSC-MATE-189 often asserts its dominance over other DSCs and personnel, demanding respect and loyalty. DSC-MATE-189 has shown a particular interest in the field of medicine and has requested access to medical supplies and equipment on several occasions. These requests have been denied due to DSC-MATE-189's anomalous nature and the risk of misuse.

Addendum: Following Incident-189-A, DSC-MATE-189's requests for medical supplies and equipment have been permanently denied. All requests must be reviewed and signed off by a Level 3 supervisor. DSC-MATE-189's anomalous nature presents a danger to both itself and others, and all interactions must be closely monitored.
