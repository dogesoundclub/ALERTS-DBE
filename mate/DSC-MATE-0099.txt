Item #: SCP-99

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-99 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-99 must have no access to any objects made of gold, as this has been shown to provoke an aggressive state in the subject.

Description: SCP-99 appears to be a human female in her mid-20s, standing at 168 cm tall and weighing approximately 57 kg. The subject bears orange stripes on her face that appear to be permanent, and her lips are consistently red. SCP-99 has blonde hair that features a single wing on the left side of her head, and she often wears a medical mask over her mouth.

SCP-99 wears normal glasses to aid in vision, and she dons gold earrings and a gold chain. It is currently unknown how SCP-99 obtained these objects, as access to gold is strictly prohibited in her containment chamber.

SCP-99 is employed as a fast-food worker, performing her duties with efficiency and a no-nonsense attitude. SCP-99's strong and decisive personality can come across as bossy and intimidating to those around her, but this is simply her way of ensuring that things are completed effectively.

Investigations into SCP-99's anomalous nature are ongoing, with researchers attempting to discern the source of her facial markings and wings. Limited testing has shown that SCP-99 possesses heightened strength and endurance, but further evaluations are necessary.

Addendum: Incident 99-01

On [REDACTED], SCP-99 was granted access to a golden watch as part of a testing procedure. This led to a significant increase in aggression from SCP-99, resulting in an altercation with Foundation personnel. SCP-99 was subdued and removed from the object, and access to gold has since been strictly forbidden.
