Item #: 5297

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5297 is to be contained in a secure facility at all times. Access to SCP-5297 is limited to Level 3 personnel and above, and any communication with SCP-5297 must be approved by the Site Director. All gifts given by SCP-5297 must be inspected before delivery to prevent any potential anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-5297 appears to be a male tiger, standing at 2 meters tall and weighing approximately 300 kilograms. SCP-5297 is capable of speech and is fluent in multiple languages. SCP-5297 often wears a hoodie with a red scarf and carries a candy stick as a signature accessory.

SCP-5297 possesses ski goggle-like eyes and a frightened mouth, which has resulted in him being described as "cute" by some individuals. However, caution is advised when interacting with SCP-5297, as he is a powerful and influential figure within organized crime, specifically as the boss of an unknown mafia group.

SCP-5297 displays a meticulous personality, characterized by being highly observant and attentive to details. These traits make SCP-5297 an excellent gift-giver, but also prone to spending an excessive amount of time agonizing over what to give to someone. These obsessive behaviors can lead SCP-5297 to act erratically, manifesting as physical outbursts, which could potentially become dangerous to those around him.

Additional Notes: SCP-5297's anomalous abilities may be linked to his proficiency in gift-giving. Further research is necessary to fully understand the extent of his capabilities.
