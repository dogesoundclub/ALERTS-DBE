SCP-745, also known as "The Monkey with the Jade Earring," is a male primate of unidentified subspecies. It measures approximately 30 inches in height and displays a frightened mouth, possibly indicating a history of abuse or trauma. Its head is adorned with a blue bandana, which it seems to regard as a treasured possession.

Although its physical characteristics alone would make it an unusual find, SCP-745's most intriguing trait is its highly empathic personality. It expresses a deep concern for the welfare of all living beings, often going out of its way to help or care for them. It has also been noted to display affection and tenderness towards inanimate objects, such as giving them names and engaging in one-sided conversations with them.

During their time in captivity, personnel have observed SCP-745 exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a fast food worker. It appears to be highly skilled in food preparation and service, and has shown remarkable adaptability to different kitchen settings and equipment.

Further study is needed to fully understand the origins and implications of SCP-745's empathic tendencies, as well as the significance of its distinctive ear accessory. Until such time as this information is acquired, it remains a valuable and intriguing specimen, requiring careful handling and monitoring.
