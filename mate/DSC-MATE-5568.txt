SCP-5568, codenamed "Emotionally Charged Officer," is a Traffic Officer who possesses an uncanny ability to detect and react to the strong emotions of those around her. Despite her seemingly mundane job, her ability makes her a valuable asset to the Foundation when it comes to containing emotionally-charged anomalies.

SCP-5568 is a female human with normal glasses and pig-tailed hair. Her forehead features a two-color band and goggles that she wears on her forehead. When prompted for a description of her abilities, SCP-5568 has claimed that the band and goggles help her focus her powers.

SCP-5568's ability to sense emotions is highly sensitive and can range from picking up on subtle glances to full-blown emotional outbursts. This results in SCP-5568 often being moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows. She is also known to have a fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings.

SCP-5568's emotional sensitivity can put her in danger of being overwhelmed by incoming emotional energy. However, her training with the Foundation has taught her to properly control and redirect the emotions she absorbs. In addition, the Foundation has provided her with counseling and emotional support to help her cope with the heavy burden she carries.

In conclusion, SCP-5568 has proven herself to be a valuable asset to the Foundation both in terms of anomaly containment and emotional support. Her abilities, while potentially dangerous, are crucial to the success of various operations and are still being studied by the Foundation for further use.
