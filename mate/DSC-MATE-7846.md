Item #: 7846

Object Class: Unknown

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7846 is to be monitored at all times while on-duty and any aberrant behavior is to be immediately reported to the local Site Director. In the event of a breach, all personnel are to evacuate the immediate area and await further orders.

Description: Subject 7846 is a male monkey, employed as a train driver. Their physical appearance is unremarkable, save for a frightened mouth and jade earring on each ear. They wear shade glasses and a LED gas mask, which serves to partially obscure their features. On their forehead, they have a two-color band.

Personality: Subject 7846 is highly observant and attentive to details, which makes them an excellent gift-giver. However, they can become preoccupied with giving the "perfect" gift and may spend a significant amount of time agonizing over what to get someone. It is unknown whether this behavior is normal for their species or a result of anomalous properties.

It is unclear how Subject 7846 attained their position as a train driver or how they are able to operate complex machinery. Further investigation is ongoing.
