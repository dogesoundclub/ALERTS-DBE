SCP-2859: The Tiger-Real Estate Agent

Description: SCP-2859 is a male Bengal Tiger standing 9 feet tall on two legs with a muscular build. They are often found wearing a red beanie atop their head, with a gold earring adorned on each ear. Additionally, a shimmering gold chain can be seen around their neck. SCP-2859 displays an excessive love for adventure that can lead to engaging in high-risk activities such as bungee jumping and wilderness adventures, often resulting in humorous outcomes. SCP-2859 is amicable and demonstrates excellent communication and negotiation skills as part of their position as a real estate agent.

Containment Procedures: SCP-2859 is contained within, Site-87, a specially constructed facility designed to accommodate their large size. SCP-2859 is allowed regular access to the facility's recreation areas for their physical exercise requirements; however, any high-risk activities must be approved by the facility's Containment Task Force. SCP-2859 is permitted to conduct real estate business under direct supervision and restricted to a pre-approved list of clients. Any unauthorized communication with the general public is considered a breach of containment and must be dealt with accordingly.

Personality: SCP-2859 is a fun-loving, thrill-seeking individual that loves adventure and is always looking for new experiences. Despite being a predator, SCP-2859 demonstrates excellent communication skills and is a successful real estate agent. They love to share their adventurous stories, and their outgoing personality makes them a favourite among the Site-87 personnel. SCP-2859 is remarkably smart, often using their intelligence to overcome obstacles when problems arise.

Additional Notes: SCP-2859's natural predatory instincts have not significantly influenced their behaviour or personality. SCP-2859 has demonstrated the ability to complete tasks with precision and planning. Their love for adventure could prove problematic in certain situations, and strict adherence to containment procedures is necessary to ensure their safety and the security of the Facility. Security personnel should display professionalism and avoid engaging in any high-risk behaviour that may encourage SCP-2859's love for action.
