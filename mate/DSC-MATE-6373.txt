Item #: 6373

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Security Guard

Species: Robot

Gender: Male

Appearance:

SCP-6373 appears to be a humanoid robot standing at approximately 6ft 2in tall. It weighs approximately 350lbs and is clad in a black metallic suit. The most notable feature of this object is its single large green cyclops eye that glows brightly at all times. SCP-6373's eyes are also lined with VR rainbow LED strips that change in color to signify its mood. On the left ear, there is a dangling red cross earring, and around its neck is a gold chain. It is often seen with a cigarette in its mouth, despite being unable to smoke.

Personality:

SCP-6373 is a diligent and attentive security guard, always keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. It shows signs of being very observant and incredibly gifted in giving the perfect gift. However, SCP-6373 may become overly concerned with finding the perfect gift, leading to anxiety and distress.

Containment:

Due to SCP-6373's ability to gift individuals quickly and well, it should be contained in a room that is kept at a low temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. SCP-6373 also needs to be supervised, as it tends to snoop on personnel and other objects. Any personnel that come into contact with SCP-6373 must be screened carefully for any unusual conditions.

Overall, SCP-6373's ability to gift individuals effectively, paired with its fragile mental state, makes it a high-risk object that needs to be monitored carefully. Any deviation in behavior must be reported quickly to the Foundation to prevent any further incidents.
