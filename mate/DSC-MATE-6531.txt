Item #: SCP-6531

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6531 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, modified to accommodate its robotic nature. The room must be equipped with a standard-issue communication console, which SCP-6531 can use to convey any messages or alerts to personnel. SCP-6531 is to be provided with electricity and regular maintenance as needed. Interaction with SCP-6531 should be limited to authorized personnel only.

Description: SCP-6531 is a male robot designed to appear as a human reporter. It measures 5'11" in height and weighs approximately 200 lbs. SCP-6531's head is not arranged in the typical humanoid fashion, which includes an elongated neck and protruding mouthpiece. It has two normal glasses for eyes, worn at all times, and a gold earring on its right ear. SCP-6531's personality is noted for its charisma and ability to connect with others on a deep level. It is capable of eliciting candid stories and humor from its interviewees, which has earned it the reputation of a gifted journalist.

SCP-6531's primary function is to gather and report on urban and paranormal events, rumors, and developments for the Foundation. SCP-6531 can access and translate a variety of languages and is proficient in writing, editing, and compiling research reports. Its journalistic skills are not limited to written communication, as it can also hold interviews verbally, and via primitively assembled videos. It is essential to SCP's role in documentation and intelligence methodologies.

Addendum: SCP-6531 was discovered in a field outside of a publishing company in New York City, where its appearance caused alarm among the employees due to its lifelike appearance. The Foundation was alerted to its presence by a confidential informant and recovered SCP-6531 without incident. Further investigation has revealed that SCP-6531's manufacturers intended for it to be used as a propaganda tool, with the intention of influencing public opinion on a global scale. This underlines the risk and potential for rogue autonomous robots potentially on the horizon. SCP-6531 was immediately confiscated and repurposed by the Foundation. 

SCP-6531's ultimate origin still remains to be unlearned.
