Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: 9998 is to be allowed freedom of movement within the city at all times. Interaction with the general public is to be monitored and limited as necessary to prevent panic or distress. Communication with 9998 should be kept professional at all times to avoid triggering their sense of humor. Any attempts by 9998 to reveal the existence of the supernatural must be met with immediate corrective action.

Description: 9998 is a female human of average height and build, with orange stripes accentuating her facial features, and a permanently affixed smile. Her eyes are concealed behind normal glasses, and her ears are adorned with a valuable jade earring. She is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace and smoking a cigarette.

Personality: Despite her seemingly cheerful disposition, 9998 often displays a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard. Her deadpan delivery can make unexpected jokes surprisingly funny. Despite this, 9998 does not consider herself the life of the party, and tends to keep to herself when not performing her duties as an electrician. 

Addendum: Due to her unique skill set, 9998 has proven especially valuable in uncovering supernatural electrical disturbances. She has expressed interest in helping with containment and research efforts of other DSC objects, however, due to concerns about her sense of humor, this request has been denied.
