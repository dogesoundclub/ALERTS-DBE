Containment Procedures: Subject 402 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a computer workstation and internet access, to allow for future monitoring and remote communication.

Description: Subject 402 is a humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, male in gender, with an anomalous appearance. Subject's face is marked with distinct orange stripes and a mouth that appears to be frozen in a frightened expression, which may indicate a previous traumatic event or some other psychological condition.

Subject 402 frequently wears a purple cap with a headset, and sports a pair of normal glasses, giving it an overall nerdy and unassuming appearance. It also wears a gold chain and enjoys carrying a candy stick, which it often chews nervously.

Personality: Subject 402 exhibits a dry sense of humor that can be both bewildering and humorous to others. Despite not normally being the center of attention, the subject has a way of making people laugh with its deadpan style. It is generally introverted and can be socially anxious, often preferring to spend time alone while programming and coding.

Further research is required to determine the exact cause of the subject's anomalous features, their nature, and any potential risks or benefits they may present. Meanwhile, subject 402 is to be monitored closely for any unusual behavior or manifestations.
