Item #: 1075

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1075 is to be contained in a specially designed habitat within Site-██. The habitat should be similar to a natural rainforest environment, with plenty of trees, vegetation, and natural climbing structures. The enclosure should be sealed with reinforced titanium walls and monitored 24/7 by security personnel. SCP-1075 is to be provided with a variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts for sustenance, and medical evaluations are to be conducted periodically.

Description: SCP-1075 is a male monkey, measuring approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighing 25 kilograms. It shows unusual intelligence, able to communicate using sign language and exhibits human-like characteristics such as problem-solving and tool-making abilities. SCP-1075 also has green hair and is often seen wearing a purple cap and horned rim glasses. Despite its cutesy appearance, SCP-1075 is a challenging subject to handle as it has demonstrated high levels of agility and unpredictable behavior.

SCP-1075 is a highly skilled medical doctor and often surprises people with its dry sense of humor. It has a talent for delivering deadpan jokes that can take people off guard. It is not known how SCP-1075 gained these abilities or if there are others like it in existence.

Due to its unique qualities, SCP-1075 poses a significant risk to the public if it were to escape captivity. Although highly intelligent, SCP-1075 is still a wild animal and should be treated with extreme caution.

Addendum: SCP-1075 has requested human test subjects to work with, citing a desire to aid in research efforts towards medical advancements. This request is still under review by O5 Council.
