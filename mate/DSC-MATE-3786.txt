SCP-3786, codenamed "The Compassionate Guard", is a human male with striking orange stripes on his face. His nerdy glasses conceal a pair of eyes that are noted for their empathic sensitivity. SCP-3786's green hair, which is typically covered by a purple cap, and his jade earring are a part of his unique fashion style.

As a security guard for the Foundation, SCP-3786 displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards the safety of those under his care. However, what sets SCP-3786 apart is his deep empathy and understanding of others. He shows a tremendous amount of compassion towards those around him and is prone to emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering.

SCP-3786 is known to have a fondness for animals and nature, displaying a particular affinity for cats. He has been reported to spend his leisure time feeding feral cats around the Foundation's premises. SCP-3786's fondness for animals has led him to develop an acute sense of awareness of his surroundings, making him an excellent guard and ally to those under his care.

In the event of a containment breach, SCP-3786 can be relied upon to keep his head and use his training as a security guard to carry out his responsibilities. Perhaps more importantly, SCP-3786's emotional intelligence and empathy have helped him to develop a network of trusted friends and allies, making him a valuable asset to the Foundation.
