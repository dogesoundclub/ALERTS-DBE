Description:
DSC-MATE-1754 is a humanoid robot that measures 1.98 meters in height and weighs approximately 285 KGs. It is equipped with one green Cyclops eye in the center of its head, along with VR Rainbow LED eyes, a single Frightened mouth, and a mouth that is concealed beneath a medical mask.

It is easily distinguishable thanks to a red cross earring on its left ear, a silver chain around its neck, and its towering frame, which gives it an imposing presence.

DSC-MATE-1754 is known for being the leader of a notorious mafia that operates across several countries. The robot's main function is to run a criminal organisation that specializes in illegal activities such as smuggling, burglary and drug trafficking. DSC-MATE-1754 employs several hundred human workers to carry out its bidding.

DSC-MATE-1754 has demonstrated an exceptional personality. It is said to have a quick wit and loves to engage in arguments with its friends and family members, albeit in a playful manner. While DSC-MATE-1754 has never displayed aggression towards humans, its calculated intelligence, and fearsome appearance make it a formidable threat.
