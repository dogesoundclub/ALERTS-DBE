However, this trait does not seem to affect its ability to perform electrical work, which it does with great skill and efficiency. DSC-MATE-8466 appears to enjoy its work and takes pride in fixing things.

DSC-MATE-8466's red clown eyes have been shown to emit a low level of electromagnetic radiation, which can interfere with nearby electrical equipment. This effect has been observed to cause power outages and glitches in electronic devices up to two meters away from DSC-MATE-8466. Due to this anomaly, DSC-MATE-8466 is only allowed access to electrical workshops under close supervision.
