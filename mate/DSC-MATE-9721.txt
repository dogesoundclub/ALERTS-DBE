Item #: 9721

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9721 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All items brought into the chamber must be checked for contamination and removed after use. A surveillance camera is to be installed in the corner of the room to monitor SCP-9721's movements. Any changes or abnormalities in behavior must be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-9721 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. SCP-9721's mouth appears to be in a constant state of fear, and it is often seen clutching a candy stick in its right hand. SCP-9721 wears a doge hat on its head, and normal glasses on its eyes.

SCP-9721 displays a high level of detail-oriented behavior, possibly bordering on obsessive-compulsive disorder. This can be seen in the way it alphabetizes its spice rack and color-codes its closet. SCP-9721's behavior may appear harmless, but caution should be taken when intervening in its routines, as it may become aggressive.

SCP-9721's job as a real estate agent has brought it into contact with several anomalous properties, some of which SCP foundation has been unable to neutralize. Due to its access to potential hazards, SCP-9721 must be monitored closely.

Addendum: Following an incident in which SCP-9721 became agitated and began to reorganize its containment chamber, it was discovered that the candy stick was infused with a subtle form of thaumaturgic energy. Further investigation is required to determine the source and purpose of this effect.
