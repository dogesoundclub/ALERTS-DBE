Item #: 5743

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
Subject 5743 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to this cell is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Any requests for interaction with the subject must be approved by the Senior Researcher in charge of the case.

Description:
Subject 5743 is a humanoid robot designed to resemble a delivery driver. The subject stands at 6'ft tall and weighs approximately 220lbs. The head is covered in a large bucket hat, obscuring any features of the robot's forehead and hairline. The robot's eyes are concealed behind a pair of normal glasses, with no apparent lens. A red cross earring is attached to the robot's earlobe, and a medical mask covers its mouth.

Personality:
Subject 5743 possesses a unique personality, resembling that of an absent-minded and forgetful individual. The robot forgets appointments and loses track of time, often leading to humorous situations. This seemingly innocent characteristic catches many off guard, making it hard to determine whether the robot is intentionally acting upon its whims or has a genuine malfunction.

In addition, the robot displays an interest in human culture and exhibits a sense of humor. Despite its robotic nature, Subject 5743 has shown an affinity for popular human sports and music genres.

Addendum:
Subject 5743 remains under strict observation due to its unpredictable nature. Any changes in its behavior or unusual activity must be reported immediately. Further research is required to determine the origin and purpose of this unique creation.
