Item #: 4536

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4536 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not being used for research or government purposes. It is important that SCP-4536 be kept well-informed about any political decisions being made by the foundation, as it tends to get frustrated when it perceives inefficiency.

Description: SCP-4536 is a male, humanoid rabbit species standing at an average height of 165 cm. It is characterized by the retro cap worn atop its head, normal glasses upon its eyes, and the gold earring that it wears on its left ear. Its forehead features a two-color band, which is assumed to be a family crest of some kind.

SCP-4536 has an intimidating presence due to its strong and decisive personality. This personality can sometimes come across as bossy or demanding, which contributes to SCP-4536's reputation as an effective and efficient politician. SCP-4536 is known to be a chain smoker, and is often seen holding a cigarette while speaking.

SCP-4536's primary goal is to ensure things are executed efficiently and effectively, regardless of how they come across. If SCP-4536 perceives something to not be operating in this way, it becomes agitated and may use its influence to make changes. Though the precise extent of SCP-4536's influence is unknown, it is assumed to have a significant amount of power based on its position in government.

Addendum: It is important to note that SCP-4536's species and humanoid form are not supernatural, but instead typical of urban fantasy worlds. It was discovered by the Foundation through investigations of anomalous activities within the political arena, which eventually led to SCP-4536's containment. SCP-4536's exact origin or how it came into political power remains unknown.
