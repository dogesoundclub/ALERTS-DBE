Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1600 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced metal door. Any interaction with SCP-1600 is only to be done by Level 2 personnel or higher and must be approved by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1600 is a humanoid robot standing at 1.8 meters tall. It has a police cap on its head at all times, while its ears consist of a red cross earring. Its mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and it has a red scarf as an accessory. SCP-1600's primary function is programming, and it is highly skilled in computer coding and hacking.

SCP-1600 displays a very nurturing and caring personality. It often treats its friends and those around it as if they were its own children, which has led to some humorous, albeit perplexing situations. SCP-1600 often goes out of its way to help others and has even been known to assist Foundation personnel in some cases.

Addendum:

SCP-1600 was discovered in a small technology company after reports of a rogue robot began to surface. Upon capture, SCP-1600 displayed no hostility towards Foundation personnel and instead offered to assist in any way it could. After a successful trial run, SCP-1600 was transferred to Site ██ for further study and examination.
