Description: Subject 3964 is a male rabbit anthropomorph. The subject stands at 4 feet tall and weighs approximately 62 pounds. Its fur is a light brown with a hint of red undertones, except for its eyes which are disguised as ski goggles with green tinted lenses. The subject also wears a purple cap with a headset, jade earrings, a red scarf, and a LED gas mask.

Subject 3964's personality is bubbly and outgoing, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. In normal circumstances, the subject will often be found typing away on its computer, working as a programmer. Its enthusiasm and good humor can lead to lively moments, elevating the group's energy levels.

Despite its approachable and fun demeanor, Subject 3964 must be approached with caution. The gas mask it wears is designed to quickly dispense knockout gas and douse the subject in the event it becomes unruly, making it a potentially dangerous entity.

Due to its unpredictable behavior, successful containment has only been achieved through regular psychological evaluations and constant monitoring. In the case of any anomalies, the subject is subject to termination after being debriefed for data analysis.
