Item #: DSC-MATE-5647

Object Class: Euclid

Job Title: Reporter

Species: Human

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5647 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-[REDACTED]. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-5647 be permitted access to any computer, cellular device or internet access. All incoming correspondence must first be inspected, and any classified information removed. Once cleared, documents will be printed for DSC-MATE-5647's review. Any suspected correspondence deemed hazardous to containment must be reported to the commanding officer immediately.

Description: DSC-MATE-5647 is a Caucasian female, aged 32, standing at 5'8". DSC-MATE-5647's most distinguishing features are her bright blue clown eyes, offset by orange stripes, which make her easily recognizable. Additionally, DSC-MATE-5647's hair is longer and styled in a 90s style. She wears a golden earring on her right ear and a choker around her neck. While DSC-MATE-5647 appears to be a non-anomalous human, her gas mask, when worn, is capable of filtering harmful gases effectively, but it is not of anomalous nature.

DSC-MATE-5647 exhibits impulsive behavior that may lead to humorous situations. These tendencies may also be a risk to containment, and all interactions must be closely monitored. Interview subjects are advised not to engage DSC-MATE-5647 in joke-telling or other potentially inflammatory material as this may encourage the subject's impulsiveness.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5647 was recruited to act as Site-[REDACTED] based news reporter. The goal was to analyze news reports before official communication with the media. Sufficient filters were applied to the broadcasts and the internet to prevent access to sensitive information. When containment is either compromised or requires surreptitious action, DSC-MATE-5647 is deployed as a necessary precaution. DSC-MATE-5647's anomalous special masks assist in these cases, preventing the spread of anomalous compounds or viruses.
