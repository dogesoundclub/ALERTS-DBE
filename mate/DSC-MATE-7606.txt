Item #: SCP-7606

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7606 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell must be furnished with natural elements similar to their natural habitat, including plants, fruits, and tree branches. SCP-7606's diet should consist mainly of fruits and insects, with limited access to cigarettes. SCP-7606's cell is to be kept at a temperature of no less than 24 °C and a humidity level of no less than 60%.

SCP-7606 is not to be allowed in contact with humans outside of experimentation and observation since it has been observed to be highly observant and attentive to details, which may make them an excellent impersonator.

Description:

SCP-7606 is a male monkey wearing retro cap, gold earring, gold chain, and goggles on their forehead. SCP-7606 appears to be a standard Olivaceous macaque, commonly found in the forests of Southeast Asia. However, genetic testing has revealed slight differences in its DNA, which suggest the involvement of anomalous entities.

SCP-7606 has proven highly intelligent despite its capacity to learn language remains unidentified. SCP-7606 displays an unusual amount of attention to detail when presented with tasks, such as puzzles and tests.

SCP-7606 is also noted to be an avid smoker, often seen with a cigarette in between its lips. Individuals who come into physical contact with the smoke produced by SCP-7606's cigarettes experience no effects and testing have shown no difference between normal cigarettes and SCP-7606's cigarettes.

SCP-7606 displays an overly concerned behavior when it comes to selecting gifts. This personality trait often causes SCP-7606 to spend a long duration of time agonizing over selecting the perfect gifts for persons. The recommended approach to this behavior is to allow SCP-7606 to select something small and simple.

Addendum:

SCP-7606 was initially discovered in an abandoned building in the Downtown district near ██████. A containment field was established, and SCP-7606 was transferred to the nearest SCP facility. SCP-7606's origins are still unknown, and research personnel are on-going to determine their distinctive characteristics. SCP-7606 has been observed to have exceptional observational skills, and researchers are excited about the potential of SCP-7606 as an anomalous entity with high prospects for intelligence enhancement programs.
