SCP-3893, also known as "The Beautician", is a male human specimen with striking spots covering his face. Despite this distinctive feature, his warm, welcoming smile easily catches the attention of anyone who crosses his path.

SCP-3893's notable nerdy glasses are always perched on his face, giving him an air of intelligence and professionalism. He wears a blue bandana on his head, further enhancing his unique style. The green cross earring on his left ear adds a noticeable touch of rebellion and nonconformity.

In addition to his stylish ensemble, SCP-3893 always carries a candy stick, an accessory that serves as a source of comfort and relaxation for him.

However, what truly sets SCP-3893 apart is his natural talent for leadership. He possesses a charismatic personality that makes him the go-to person for guidance and advice. Whether at work, in social situations, or his personal life, SCP-3893 effortlessly takes charge of any situation.

SCP-3893's ability to lead and influence others is a valuable asset that must be monitored and investigated further by Foundation personnel.
