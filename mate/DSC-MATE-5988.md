Item #: 5988

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with regular check-ups by a psychological specialist.

Description: Subject 5988, known by her pseudonym "Orange Stripes", is a female human with notable physical features, primarily her orange and black striped hair. Her red clown eyes are a defining feature of her face, and her head is described as "not arranged green". She is often seen with a two-color band on her forehead and a cigarette in hand. 

Personality-wise, Orange Stripes is known for her natural charm and charisma which make her the life of the party. Her humorous nature borders on the absurd, occasionally leading her to tell jokes or perform silly dances to make others laugh. 

Despite her seemingly carefree personality, Orange Stripes has been known to harbor darker thoughts and engage in behavior that some may deem as risky or careless. Her true motivations are largely unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. 

Due to her unpredictable nature, Orange Stripes is considered a potential hazard and must be handled with caution. Any personnel interacting with her must maintain strict professionalism and remain alert for any signs of deviation from expected behavior. 

Addendum: After a thorough debriefing, it has been determined that Orange Stripes possesses no anomalous abilities or characteristics. However, it is vital that she remains closely monitored due to her seemingly unpredictable behavior and potential for causing disturbances within the Foundation's operations. All personnel should exercise extreme caution when interacting with her to avoid any potential hazards.
