Item #: DSC-MATE-1023

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1023 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a single bed, a small table, and one chair. Due to its sentient nature, DSC-MATE-1023 is allowed to perform its job as a mechanic under supervision by Foundation personnel. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-1023 outside of its job is strictly prohibited.

Description: DSC-MATE-1023 is a female human with identifying spots on its face and purple lipstick. Its eyes are red with a clown-like appearance. Its head is blonde with an unusual pair of wings attached to it. DSC-MATE-1023 frequently wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask.

DSC-MATE-1023 possesses the ability to daydream and become lost in thought easily. While this introspective nature can entertain others in humorous situations, it has a potentially hazardous side-effect: DSC-MATE-1023 can accidentally injure itself while distracted.

DSC-MATE-1023’s unique physical features led to a series of tests that determined its origins. These tests showed that DSC-MATE-1023 is not of supernatural origin, and its wings are a separate entity from itself. They are classified as DSC-MATE-1023-1, and they are believed to be of Western Red Adair origin.

DSC-MATE-1023’s temperament is generally calm and cooperative, causing no harm or anomalous effect on its own accord. DSC-MATE-1023 only poses a threat when its introspective daydreaming may lead to accidents.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1023 caused a minor containment breach on ██/██/20██ while distracted by an unknown thought. It was quickly contained, and stricter measures are now in place to prevent such accidents. Review of DSC-MATE-1023’s containment protocols is ongoing.
