Item#: 6499

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6499 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No special containment procedures are necessary, but SCP-6499's current employment as a fashion designer must be monitored to ensure that no anomalous behavior occurs during work.

Description: SCP-6499 is a human male of average height and build, with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth expression. SCP-6499's head is adorned with a police cap, and he wears a green cross earring on his left ear. SCP-6499 often wears a gold chain around his neck, and can be seen carrying a candy stick as a form of stress relief.

SCP-6499 has exhibited a highly creative and imaginative personality, with a keen interest in poetry writing, cosplay, and collecting unusual objects. It is unknown whether these interests are related to his anomalous properties.

SCP-6499's anomalous properties remain unknown. However, due to his vocation as a fashion designer, SCP-6499 has access to a large number of individuals, including celebrities and socialites, providing a possible avenue for anomalous behavior to occur.

SCP-6499 has not displayed any violent or threatening behavior, and is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, the potential for anomalous activity necessitates careful monitoring of SCP-6499's activities both in and outside of work.

SCP-6499 was discovered in [REDACTED], where reports of unusual fashion designs and strange rumors surrounding SCP-6499's work became more frequent. After investigating, Foundation operatives apprehended SCP-6499 and transferred him to Site-██.

Addendum: SCP-6499 has expressed a desire to create a special line of clothing for Foundation personnel. This request is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
