Item #: 9330

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9330 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a bed, desk, and television that receives no news channels. The chamber must be soundproofed to isolate SCP-9330 from external stimuli whenever SCP-9330 is experiencing heightened anxiousness or fears. SCP-9330 is to receive regular psychological evaluations and counseling to ensure a stable mental state.

Description: SCP-9330 is a talking, humanoid rabbit with blue clown eyes that stands at 1.5 meters. SCP-9330 is a male rabbit, who is currently employed as a news anchor. SCP-9330 is easily frightened and tends to present a horrified facial expression often resulting in flattened, alert ears and aggressive panting. SCP-9330's head is adorned with a police cap with two colored bands along the forehead and its ears decorated with a gold earring. SCP-9330 is commonly found wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick. SCP-9330 often presents a goofy and playful personality that seems to seek social connections with others.

SCP-9330 has shown significant levels of empathy towards other humanoids, often mimicking psychological traits exhibited by those it is communicating with. SCP-9330's playful nature has led to SCP-9330 engaging in humorous situations, such as telling jokes or engaging in playful banter with other humanoids. Furthermore, SCP-9330 has been observed developing strong bonds with personnel on staff, often seeking their company when feeling distressed.

SCP-9330 has an acute susceptibility to external stimuli, and this unnerves and alarms SCP-9330, leading to a heightened state of anxiety. When exposed to news or any media that involves harm to humanoids, it displays heightened levels of anxiety, giving rise to breathing difficulties (gasping, panting), uncontrollable thumb fidgeting, and physical tremors.

Note: SCP-9330 appears to benefit from social connections and activities, and therefore, its mental state can strongly impact its health. It is recommended that SCP-9330 is given opportunities for play, social bonding, and humor to keep its mental health stable.
