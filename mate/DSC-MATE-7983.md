Item #: 7983

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7983 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be furnished with a variety of puzzles and toys to make sure that the subject remains engaged and content. Personnel are to avoid startling the creature or alarming it in any way, as this could trigger a panicked response.

Description: Subject 7983 appears to be a small brown monkey, measuring approximately 2 feet in height when standing upright. Its hands and feet are adapted for grasping and climbing, allowing it to easily maneuver around its environment. Notably, the subject appears to wear a pair of goggles on its forehead at all times, although it is not clear what purpose these serve.

On closer inspection, it can be seen that the subject has a frightened expression on its face most of the time, with its mouth held in a slight grimace. It also wears a jade earring in one ear and carries a whistle as an accessory. Despite its small size and unassuming appearance, subject 7983 possesses remarkable speed and agility, capable of darting and dodging with ease.

The subject has been observed to exhibit an absent-minded personality, sometimes losing track of time or forgetting appointments. When focused on a particular task, however, it can become highly engrossed and difficult to distract. Subject 7983 is not prone to aggression, but will become panicked if it feels trapped or threatened.

Addendum: Incident 7983-A - On ██/██/20██, subject 7983 became agitated during a routine examination and escaped its containment cell. It gained access to several areas of the facility before being recaptured by security personnel. During the incident, several staff members reported feeling as though they were being watched or followed, although no additional entities were discovered. As a result, it is recommended that personnel exercise caution when working near subject 7983.
