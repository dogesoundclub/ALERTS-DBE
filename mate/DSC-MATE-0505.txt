Item #: 505

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 505 is to be monitored at all times, and any changes to their behavior or appearance should be reported immediately to the Foundation. The subject is currently working as a real estate agent and is to be allowed to continue their work in order to maintain normalcy. However, they are to be kept under surveillance to ensure they do not use their empathetic nature for their personal gain.

Description: Subject 505 appears to be a human male with frightened mouth and blue clown eyes. They have an unarranged green wildhair, with a two-color band and goggles always affixed to their forehead. The subject is always seen wearing a medical mask and a silver chain around their neck.

Personality: Subject 505 is highly empathetic and compassionate. They have a tendency to take on other people's problems as their own, feeling responsible for fixing everything and everyone around them. This can be both admirable and a bit exhausting, as they often neglect their own well-being in the process. It is not clear what triggered this personality trait, but it appears to be deeply ingrained in their character.

Addendum: Subject 505 has exhibited no other anomalous behavior or characteristics. They have cooperated fully with Foundation personnel, and their job as a real estate agent provides a cover for their presence in the community. Further observation is required to determine if their empathetic nature poses any risk to containment protocols.
