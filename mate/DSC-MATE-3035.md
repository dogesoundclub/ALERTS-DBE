Item #: 3035

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3035 is to be kept on a regular patrol schedule as a traffic officer in [REDACTED] City. Any deviations from the expected schedule should be immediately reported to the Site Director in charge of DSC-MATE-3035. DSC-MATE-3035 is to be provided with a standard-issue gas mask to protect its respiratory system from airborne toxins. Access to any advanced technology or tools must be approved by the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-3035 is a male monkey specimen of the genus Macaca with green hair and a purple cap. It is commonly seen wearing a pair of normal glasses, a gold earring, and a silver chain. Despite its primate appearance, DSC-MATE-3035 is capable of performing basic human language and communication skills. It is a practical and hands-on individual, often resorting to unconventional means to solve a problem. DSC-MATE-3035 possesses a remarkable mechanical aptitude and can repair many items using only duct tape or paper clips.

DSC-MATE-3035's utility in the field of traffic control led Foundation operatives to recruit it into the DSC program. However, due to its unconventional approach to problem-solving, DSC-MATE-3035 must remain under constant supervision to prevent it from using unauthorized technologies or modifying its assigned equipment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3035's gas mask appears to be a vital component in its continued existence. When removed, DSC-MATE-3035 exhibits signs of acute respiratory distress and can become unresponsive. Under no circumstances should DSC-MATE-3035 be allowed to remove or modify this device without explicit approval from the Site Director.
