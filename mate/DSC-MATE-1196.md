Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1196 is to be monitored for any unusual behavior and must be cleared by a senior officer before being allowed to operate any train or similar public transportation vehicles. Given its characteristic logical and analytical demeanor, it is recommended that any individuals or groups that interact with the subject be well-versed in rational debate and possess an unruffled temperament.

Description: 1196 is a male rabbit who stands approximately 1m tall. The subject is often seen wearing a bucket hat and horned rim glasses to protect its eyes from sunlight and dust. A whistle, gold chain, glimmering Jade earring, and a goggle on its forehead are frequently observed intermingling with the subject's fur. 1196 has a crisp-sounding voice it uses to give orders and collect tickets for public transport.

Personality: 1196's personality is calm, rational, and polite in most situations. It has a fondness for rational debate and is highly analytical, providing it with the ability to predict many outcomes that others may find challenging to quantify. However, its love for debate and logic can be its undoing. It engages in roundtable discussions, even on topics that it shouldn't participate in, and presents itself as highly competitive during these discussions.

As a result of engaging with the public frequently, 1196 has a warm and welcoming personality, displaying its knowledge with honesty and enthusiasm. Despite its competitive nature, 1196 is passionate about solving complex problems and optimistic about finding a solution. One must understand that 1196 can be spooked very easily, triggering its rather unpredictable defensive reactions.
