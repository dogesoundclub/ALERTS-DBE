Item #: 7703

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7703 is to be allowed to continue their work as a train driver, as it poses no threat to the general public. However, all access to their personal library must be monitored and regulated by Foundation personnel. Any attempts by 7703 to acquire obscure or dangerous knowledge must be reported immediately.

Description: Subject 7703 appears to be an average human male in his mid-thirties, with green layers for hair and a jade earring in each ear. Their most distinctive feature is the candy stick they carry with them at all times, which they often suck on absent-mindedly while deep in thought. 7703 has a unique thirst for knowledge, and spends much of their free time reading, researching, and collecting books and documentaries on a wide range of subjects.

Personality: 7703 can be characterized as an intellectual who revels in the acquisition and sharing of knowledge. They are extremely passionate about their interests, and often go on lengthy rants about obscure topics to anyone who will listen. Despite their love of learning, 7703 is approachable and friendly, and is often willing to share their knowledge with those who express an interest. However, the Foundation must exercise caution in allowing them access to any information that could potentially be used for destructive purposes.

Recovery Log: 7703 came to the attention of the Foundation after an incident involving a rare book that they had acquired. Foundation agents were able to recover the book before it could be used for any nefarious purposes, and subsequently began monitoring 7703's activities. Despite their penchant for acquiring dangerous knowledge, 7703 has shown no signs of malicious intent and has cooperated fully with the Foundation's monitoring efforts.
