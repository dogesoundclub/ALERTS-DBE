SCP-9424 is a sentient, bipedal rabbit of moderate size that manifests a constant and severe state of fearfulness, as exhibited by its perpetually trembling body and wide-eyed, frightened expression. Its most prominent facial feature is its mouth, which is often agape and trembling, giving it the appearance of a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle. SCP-9424's eyes are obscured by a pair of horn-rimmed glasses, which are worn with an air of self-importance and studiousness.

On its head, SCP-9424 sports a "Doge Hat", a popular meme-themed accessory among humans. Additionally, SCP-9424 has a jade earring adorning its left ear, likely fashioned after one of the many trinkets found in the area surrounding its original containment location.

SCP-9424's personality is marked by a strong sense of independence and self-reliance, even to its detriment. It has been observed stubbornly refusing to ask for help, even when it is urgently needed. This trait often leads to humorous situations, such as when SCP-9424 tries to move a heavy object alone or stubbornly refuses to use a map when lost.

SCP-9424's current occupation is as a veterinarian, working primarily with small mammals and exotic creatures. It has demonstrated impressive medical knowledge and skill, despite its anxiety-ridden demeanor. However, SCP-9424's handlers are advised to monitor its interactions with animals and humans closely, as it has been known to snap onto its more aggressive and territorial instincts without warning.
