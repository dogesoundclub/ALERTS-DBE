SCP-3547, codenamed "The Vet", is a male tiger with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. As a veterinarian, he has a wealth of knowledge in veterinary medicine and animal behavior, which he never tires of expanding. SCP-3547's eyes are currently unknown, although they are speculated to be a piercing yellow or green color, reminiscent of its feline ancestry.

SCP-3547 exhibits an unusual feature on its forehead, boasting two distinct colored bands that resemble the markings of a police officer's hat. It's often seen sporting a police cap on its head, which further reinforces its authoritative persona.

Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-3547 is a mild-mannered and friendly creature. It expresses a strong desire to educate others, often through sharing its own passion for reading, researching, and collecting obscure educational materials. It even carries around a whistle accessory, which it can occasionally use to get people's attention and launch into educational speeches.

However, SCP-3547 is not to be underestimated. Its feline instincts are still present, and it has been known to exhibit fierce protectiveness over animals under its care. It's also noted that SCP-3547 has a keen sense of smell and hearing, which make it an invaluable asset for any urban fantasy scenario.
