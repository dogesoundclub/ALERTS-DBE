Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-1720 is to be held within a standard humanoid containment cell located within Site-██. All communications with SCP-1720 must be conducted through an intercom system, and all items brought into the containment cell must be thoroughly checked for any potential security breaches. SCP-1720 is permitted to perform limited deliveries of supplies and equipment, as long as they are supervised by at least one armed guard.

Description:

SCP-1720 is a female human delivery driver, standing at 1.73 meters tall and weighing 66 kilograms. Their skin is marked with several freckles and distinct spots, and their lips are a vibrant purple. SCP-1720's eyes are replaced with Virtual Reality Rainbow LED technology, giving the appearance of a constantly shifting rainbow pattern. Their head is covered in a layer of metallic blue material, while a pair of goggles are worn on their forehead.

SCP-1720's personality is notable for their deep sense of empathy and compassion for others. They are easily moved to tears or emotional outbursts when exposed to others' suffering or pain, and are often willing to go above and beyond their duties to help those in need. SCP-1720 displays a particular fondness for animals and nature, often using delivery routes that showcase local wildlife or parks.

Addendum:

SCP-1720 was brought to the Foundation's attention after reports surfaced of an anomalous delivery driver delivering supplies to areas of the city normally inaccessible by conventional means. Upon investigation, SCP-1720 was found to possess unique abilities that allowed them to navigate the urban environment in ways that other drivers could not. Despite their cooperative attitude, SCP-1720's strange appearance and abilities make them a potential security risk, and their movements must be carefully monitored.
