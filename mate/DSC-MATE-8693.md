Item #: 8693

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8693 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any attempts to access his personal bank accounts are to be closely monitored and immediately reported to senior personnel. Due to his spontaneously risky behavior, 8693 should always be accompanied by no less than two security personnel at all times.

Description: 8693 is a male human, approximately 35 years old. He has orange stripes on his face, and is commonly seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, green cross earring, and a gold chain. His eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and he is often seen wearing a normal gas mask.

Subject 8693 tends to be very spontaneous and enjoys taking risks, often doing things on a whim. This has led to some humorous situations, such as him impulsively deciding to jump off a cliff into a lake or river.

It is believed that 8693 worked as a banker prior to containment, and as such he has access to a significant amount of wealth. All financial transactions are to be closely monitored and reported to senior personnel.

Addendum: 8693 has been observed displaying anomalous behavior, such as his spontaneous and often successful attempts to predict stock market trends. Research is ongoing to determine the extent of his abilities and their potential uses.
