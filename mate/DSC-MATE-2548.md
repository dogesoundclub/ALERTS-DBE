Description: Subject 2548 is a female human of average height with distinctive features on its face, including spots and a purple lip. Its eyes are a bright orange color and are topped with unusual, elongated eyebrows. The subject's head is commonly adorned with rainbow-themed clothing, while its ears are often decorated with a red cross earring. Its mouth is covered with a medical mask as a habitual accessory. Finally, the subject is almost always wearing a choker around its neck.

Subject 2548 tends to display a highly organized and efficient personality that can sometimes give off a controlling social dynamic. This demeanor makes it an excellent leader in circumstances that require a strong-willed individual capable of handling a large number of people cohesively. However, it can also lead to humorous situations in which subject 2548 takes over group projects or events, delegating tasks to others matter-of-factly.

Considering the subject's profession, it is not uncommon to see it looking for opportunities to obtain newsworthy content wherever it goes. Despite that, it tends to be mindful of others' privacy. 

To date, there is no record of paranormal activity, nor has the subject demonstrated any relevant anomalous properties. However, it could potentially be valuable as a source of information in certain investigations, given its job as a professional reporter.
