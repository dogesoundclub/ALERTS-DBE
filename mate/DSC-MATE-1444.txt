Item #: SCP-1444

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1444 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with a minimum size of 10 feet by 10 feet. The chamber must be equipped with an electrical outlet to provide SCP-1444 with an outlet to discharge energy. The gas mask worn by SCP-1444 must be checked for integrity daily and replaced as necessary. SCP-1444 is allowed to choose its preferred form of exercise provided that it does not interfere with its containment. Any attempts by SCP-1444 to introduce electrical wiring or equipment into the containment chamber without proper authorization must be immediately reported to site security.

Description: SCP-1444 appears as a male rabbit standing at 2 feet tall with red clown eyes and a frightened mouth. SCP-1444 wears a goggle on its forehead and a gold chain around its neck. It also wears a jade earring on its right ear and regularly contains LED gas masks for respiration.

SCP-1444 identified itself as an electrician with a personality that suits its profession. SCP-1444 is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas, which can lead to humorous situations in which SCP-1444 suggests outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react. SCP-1444 has demonstrated the ability to manipulate electrical currents and can produce energy discharges that can cause harm to others if not controlled.

SCP-1444 is capable of fitting into and manipulating electrical devices with ease. More than once, SCP-1444 has helped Site-██ staff to repair or maintain machinery, reducing downtime and increasing productivity.

While SCP-1444 does not show any signs of aggression, past incidents have resulted in unexpected energy discharges that were determined to be involuntary. Site-██ staff must approach SCP-1444 with caution and notify security immediately upon experiencing unusual symptoms.

Addendum: SCP-1444 expressed interest in redesigning the electrical systems used in Site-██'s containment chambers. The proposal was denied as it had the potential to disrupt current security measures. SCP-1444 has since withdrawn from the proposal and agreed to continue working within set parameters.
