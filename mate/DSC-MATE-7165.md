Item #: 7165

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7165 is to be kept in a standard interview room and is not to be released under any circumstances. All personnel must be warned not to provoke, startle or physically touch 7165. Security personnel will observe 7165 from the corridor outside the room. Any personnel found violating these procedures will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

Description: 7165 is a male Siberian tiger with bright blue clown eyes, wearing a bucket hat, a silver chain and a whistle hanging from his neck. 7165 has shown to possess a strong sense of duty and responsibility with an uncanny ability to recognize dangers and uncover secrets. His keen sense of smell, excellent hearing and sharp mind make him an invaluable asset to any investigative team. However, his playful and humorous nature often contrasts with his duties as a reporter, leading to unforeseen situations.

Despite his physical and intellectual capabilities, 7165 enjoys a good party and can turn any gathering into a lively and festive event. He has been observed to dance, sing and make friends easily with people of all races and backgrounds, with the notable exception of hunters and poachers.

Addendum: 7165 was found in a circus in South America, where he was trained to perform tricks and stunts for entertainment. Foundation agents were alerted to the animal's unusual intelligence by an anonymous source, and he was brought in for evaluation. After extensive testing, 7165 was deemed too valuable to be terminated, and he was given a new identity as a reporter working for the Foundation's media department.
