Description: SCP-157 is a humanoid robot designed to resemble a male firefighter. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 300 pounds. It has one green cyclops eye as its primary facial feature, surrounded by a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. Its head is covered with a hoodie, and it wears a gold chain and whistle as accessories.

Despite its appearance and materials, SCP-157 exhibits anomalous properties that cannot be replicated through conventional robotics. It can move and operate with human-like dexterity and strength. SCP-157 has displayed a personality that can be described as daring and impulsive, often putting itself in danger to complete its objective.

SCP-157 has a unique power source that requires a constant flow of electricity. It can generate and store energy in its internal battery, as well as absorb it from external sources. SCP-157's power sources are unconfirmed and believed to be supernatural in nature.

Addendum: SCP-157 was recovered by Foundation agents after reports of a fire in a residential area. Witnesses reported that SCP-157 arrived on the scene and extinguished the blaze alone, without assistance from local firefighters. The Foundation stepped in to contain SCP-157 after it displayed anomalous abilities and properties. Further investigation reveled that SCP-157 was created by a civilian inventor and was unknown to the public until its debut at the fire scene.
