Item #: DSC-MATE-7694

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7694 is to be contained in a human-sized enclosure in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The enclosure must not have any sharp objects, as DSC-MATE-7694 has been known to accidentally injure itself due to its species. Any attempt made by DSC-MATE-7694 to leave the containment chamber must be immediately reported to the personnel and a relevant security team.

DSC-MATE-7694 is to be provided with basic amenities such as food, water, and access to a veterinarian. Experimentation is to be conducted on DSC-MATE-7694 by authorized personnel only.

Description: DSC-MATE-7694 is a male veterinarian robot with a single green cyclops eye and a frightened-looking mouth. Its head is covered with green hair in a purple cap and wears a jade earring. DSC-MATE-7694 also dons a red scarf and a normal gas mask.

DSC-MATE-7694 has a strong sense of independence and may be reluctant to ask for help even when it desperately needs it. This trait leads to humorous situations as it tries to move a heavy furniture piece or stubbornly refuses to use a map when lost.

DSC-MATE-7694's robotic nature grants it an unparalleled capacity for endurance and strength. It has been subject to several analyses, and researchers have determined that DSC-MATE-7694 is powered by a combination of an arc reactor and an experimental energy source that acts as its "heart." DSC-MATE-7694 can produce and store energy on its own, granting it a remarkable degree of autonomy in the field.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-7694's unique template, the Foundation's Robotics Department has requested multiple opportunities to work with DSC-MATE-7694 in-depth, with the hope of enhancing the system's capabilities into more models.
