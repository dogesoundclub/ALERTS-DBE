Item #: 7206

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 7206 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber and is to be provided with a minimum of 20lbs of raw meat per day. The containment chamber is to be fitted with soundproofing material to prevent any form of auditory disturbance. 7206 has shown no hostile behavior thus far, but any signs of aggression are to be immediately reported to the site director. 

Description: 7206 is a male tiger standing over 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 500lbs. What sets 7206 apart from the rest of its species is its vibrant rainbow LED eyes that change hue according to its mood. Its head is covered with green fur and adorned with a jade earring on each ear. 7206 wears a medical mask over its mouth, which has been found to prevent infection spread, and a gold chain draped around its neck. 

Personality: 7206 is a highly empathetic individual, displaying a level of emotional intelligence well beyond any known tiger species. It often exhibits compassion towards the people around it and will frequently take on the problems of others as its own, much to the benefit and detriment of both parties. 7206 can become a bit obsessive in its desire to fix the issues of those around it and has been known to go to great lengths to do so. However, its unerring sincerity and genuine desire to help others make it an invaluable asset.

Addendum: Research on 7206 has indicated a potential for limited telepathic communication with highly emotionally charged individuals. Further tests are needed to explore this possibility.
