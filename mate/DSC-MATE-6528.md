Item #: 6528

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 6528 is to be kept in its human form under 24/7 surveillance by a trained security team. The subject is allowed to conduct normal daily operations at The Paramount Theater, under the guise of the theater's manager. It is instructed to refrain from using its anomalous abilities unless authorized by Foundation personnel.

Description: Item 6528 is a bipedal tiger, standing at approximately 6'3" in height. The subject has distinctive two-color bands across its forehead, and it often carries a whistle as an accessory. Its eyes are currently unknown.

Personality: Item 6528 has displayed a highly practical and hands-on nature, often fixing problems in innovative, unorthodox ways. Its ability to improvise and make do with limited resources has been noted by Foundation personnel. However, its tendency towards reckless behavior and impulsiveness means that strict monitoring is required to mitigate any potential danger.

Addendum: Item 6528 was discovered by the Foundation after a series of reports detailing a man with tiger-like characteristics managing a theater in the downtown area. After covertly observing the subject's behavior, Foundation personnel were able to confirm its anomalous properties and secure its confinement. Its usefulness as an asset in the field cannot be denied, as its strength and agility make it a valuable asset in combat situations. However, its volatile nature means that its utilization must be closely monitored to prevent its abilities from being abused.
