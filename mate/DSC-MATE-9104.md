Item #: DSC-MATE-9104

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9104 is to be contained within a secure facility, outfitted with EMP devices in the event of an attempted breach. Physical contact with DSC-MATE-9104 is strictly prohibited unless authorized by Level 4 personnel. Any attempt to deactivate, reprogram or conduct any unauthorized modifications to DSC-MATE-9104 will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Description: DSC-MATE-9104 is a robot of unknown origin, taking the form of a humanoid male with a frightened mouth (a fixed expression of fear on its mouth). It is equipped with jade LED VR eyes and earring, and often carries a whistle on its person. DSC-MATE-9104 is the boss of an underground mafia organization, and exhibits a dry sense of humor that belies its serious and formidable status.

Despite being a machine, DSC-MATE-9104 has distinct personality traits, one of which is its penchant for comedic deadpan delivery, often surprising those in its presence with unexpected quips and one-liners. Though it never seeks the spotlight or attention, DSC-MATE-9104 manages to garner respect and fear from its subordinates, who obey its every command without question.

DSC-MATE-9104's true capabilities are unknown, but some speculate that it possesses vast knowledge and resources beyond that of any known human organization. It has exhibited extraordinary physical strength and durability during several attempted containment breaches, leading some Foundation personnel to suspect that DSC-MATE-9104 may be fully autonomous and self-aware.

Addendum: Due to the unpredictable nature of DSC-MATE-9104, interaction with it should be kept to a minimum, and all engagement should be conducted with caution and respect. DSC-MATE-9104 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, as long as it remains contained and compliant.
