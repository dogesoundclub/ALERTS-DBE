SCP-7536 is an intriguing specimen. A police officer by profession, this female human is known for her distinctive appearance. Her orange stripes and retro cap make for a striking face features combination, while the green cross earring adds a touch of mystery to her character.

However, it is her medical mask that has made the biggest impact on those who've encountered her. While many may assume it's for health reasons, we at SCP know the real reason behind it. You see, SCP-7536 has a strong sense of independence which many times borders on stubbornness.

Her reluctance to ask for help has gotten her into awkward situations, such as trying to move heavy furniture alone or refusing to use a map when lost. But we won't hold that against her, as it's just another trait that makes her unique. 

In terms of her personality, SCP-7536 is the type that you don't want to mess with. She has a no-nonsense approach to everything she does, and her determination is unmatched. But beneath that tough exterior lies a heart of gold. She cares deeply for those around her despite her tough cop persona, and will go to any lengths to protect them. 

In conclusion, SCP-7536 is a human with a story yet to be unveiled. We here at SCP are invested in unraveling the mysteries surrounding her, and we do it all in the name of science!
