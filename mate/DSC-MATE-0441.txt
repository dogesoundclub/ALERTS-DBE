Item #: SCP-441

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-441 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. All personnel assigned to SCP-441 must undergo a background check before any contact, and any attempts to remove SCP-441 from its containment must be met with severe disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-441 is a human male who identifies itself as a fashion designer. It stands at approximately 172 cm tall and weighs approximately 65 kg. SCP-441’s most noticeable facial feature is an intricate set of spots, which resemble freckles, covering its entire face. SCP-441 is often seen wearing a bucket hat on its head and a silver chain around its neck. It also has a jade earring in one ear and wears nerd glasses as part of its regular attire.

SCP-441 can be described as quite forgetful and absent-minded, which can lead to humorous situations. It has been known to forget appointments, lose track of time, and miss important events due to its absent-mindedness. Despite this, SCP-441 is highly creative and passionate about its work, often becoming lost in thought while working on a project.

SCP-441 has not demonstrated any anomalous abilities or traits so far, although its background and history remain unknown. SCP-441’s claim of being a fashion designer has not been fully verified, and further investigation into its past and work is ongoing.

Addendum: During a routine checkup, SCP-441 revealed that its forehead has a unique two-color band pattern that is only visible under specific lighting conditions. Analysis of SCP-441’s DNA showed no deviation from typical human genetic code. Further research is ongoing to understand the origin and purpose of this pattern.
