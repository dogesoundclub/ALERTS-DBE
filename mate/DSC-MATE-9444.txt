SCP-9444 is a humanoid entity, identified as an electrician by its occupation. Its appearance is striking, with orange stripes adorning its face and a clown mouth that seems to be permanently fixed in a grin. Its blue clown eyes seem to twinkle with a twisted sense of humor as it goes about its daily business. 

The entity's head is covered in green layers that seem to shimmer and glow, and its ears are adorned with a cross-shaped green earring. It often sports a silver chain around its neck and can be seen smoking a cigarette, adding to its rebellious and non-conformist personality.

SCP-9444 is known for its analytical and logical approach, taking on tasks with a level of precision and focus that borders on the obsessive. It possesses a keen intellect and is often found making sharp, witty observations or teasing its friends in a dry and deadpan manner, its quirky sense of humor never too far from the surface.

Despite its playful nature, SCP-9444 should be approached with caution, as its unpredictable behavior and tendency towards taking unnecessary risks can be a danger to itself and others. It is recommended that all interactions with this entity be carefully monitored and controlled to ensure the safety of all involved.
