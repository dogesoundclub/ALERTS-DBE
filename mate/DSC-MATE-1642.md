Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1642 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with high tech CCTV cameras and microphones to ensure constant monitoring of the subject. Any personnel entering the chamber to interact with DSC-MATE-1642 must wear earplugs to protect against any dangerous sonic emissions.

Description: DSC-MATE-1642 is a male rabbit with a frightened mouth and unknown eyes. Its head is adorned with a purple cap and a headset, while its ears are pierced with a gold earring. DSC-MATE-1642 is often seen wearing a gold chain around its neck as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-1642 displays an unusual personality trait, characterized by its love for quick wit and debate. Whenever given a chance, it engages in debates and arguments with friends and family, often resulting in humorous situations.

Despite its seemingly harmless demeanor, DSC-MATE-1642 is considered a dangerous villain due to its ability to emit powerful sonic waves from its headset. These waves can cause severe damage to the surrounding environment and anyone nearby. As such, DSC-MATE-1642 is to be approached with extreme caution and only interacted with by trained personnel wearing earplugs.

DSC-MATE-1642 was previously apprehended by the Foundation during an interdimensional event, where it was found to be causing significant damage to a cityscape by unleashing powerful sonic waves. It was quickly taken into containment and has remained there ever since, undergoing regular testing and monitoring to ensure the safety of Foundation personnel and the general public.

Addendum: The origins of DSC-MATE-1642 remain unknown. However, it is suspected that it may have been transported from another dimension as part of a larger interdimensional incident. Further investigation is required to confirm this theory.
