SCP Foundation Report: 7483 "The Forgetful Villain"

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 7483 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with a reinforced door and surveillance cameras installed for observation at all times. She is to be restrained with specialized handcuffs that neutralize her ability to manipulate time within a five-meter radius. Under no circumstances is contact with 7483 to be made without proper protection; her gas mask is to remain secured at all times. Any attempts by 7483 to manipulate the timeline must be immediately reported to site security.

Description: 7483 is a humanoid of the female gender with bright blue eyes resembling those of a clown. The subject's head is typically covered with a hoodie, and she wears an orange striped shirt. 7483 possesses an anomalous ability to manipulate time to a certain degree within a small area of effect. Witnesses have described the effect as if time seems to stutter or skip. However, this effect only lasts a few seconds and leaves 7483 disoriented and unable to recall what happened during these skipped moments.

The subject also possesses a choker, which causes time manipulation to become amplified when the user focuses on it. She has been observed using this object to create short-lived time loops or to accelerate and decelerate time selectively. Additionally, 7483 also carries a gas mask that provides protection against her reality-altering powers.

7483 presents a somewhat absent-minded personality and forgetful nature, often losing track of time and appointments or getting distracted while working on a project. This personality trait is exacerbated by her own reality-altering powers, often causing her to skip critical moments or events, much to the chagrin of her allies and employers.

The subject is highly dangerous and should not be approached without protective gear. 7483 is known to work for several villainous organizations and can cause significant damage if left unmonitored or unrestrained.

Addendum 7483-01: During a containment breach, 7483 escaped her containment cell, and the site-wide alert was triggered. Reports indicate that she utilized her ability to create a time portal to enter the "near future." Foundation personnel dispatched a retrieval team, and the subject was recaptured without incident. Upon interrogation, 7483 denied knowledge of the breach and insists that she was attempting to avoid it. However, her orange-striped shirt was found to be covered in blood, and no explanation was provided. Further testing and observation of 7483 are ongoing.
