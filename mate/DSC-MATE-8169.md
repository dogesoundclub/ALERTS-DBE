Item #: 8169

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8169 must be monitored at all times and is restricted to a small area within the bank. Any attempt to leave this area requires explicit permission from foundation personnel. Under no circumstances should she be allowed to interact with any anomalous objects or beings.

Description: 8169 is a human female with spots on her face and a signature red lip. She sports a short, witchy haircut and is often seen wearing a gold chain around her neck. Despite her mundane appearance, 8169 possesses a unique ability to fix objects using unorthodox methods. Her practical and hands-on nature has even earned her the nickname "The McGyver Banker."

Under non-supernatural circumstances, 8169 is known to fix broken objects using materials such as duct tape, glue, and paper clips. While she lacks the technical knowledge of an engineer or mechanic, her creativity and resourcefulness have allowed her to devise unconventional solutions to problems others may find too complicated.

Although 8169 appears to be a well-adjusted member of society, it is believed that she has a hidden understanding of the supernatural. It is rumored that she may have encountered anomalous beings or objects in her past, leading her to become involved with the foundation.

Addendum: Due to her unique abilities, 8169 has been approved for use in tactical operations involving the manipulation of mundane objects. Proper caution must be taken to avoid exposure to the supernatural, as her abilities may be ineffective or even dangerous in such situations.
