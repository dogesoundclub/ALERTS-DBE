Description: SCP-473 is a humanoid robot that appears to be modeled after a human farmer. Its head resembles a hooded sweatshirt with ski goggles for eyes, and wears an LED gas mask as an accessory. SCP-473's physical appearance appears to be a blend of modern machinery and old farming equipment.

SCP-473's personality is highly analytical and logical, with a tendency towards debating and arguing with others. SCP-473 has been observed engaging in debates about trivial topics with others, often leading to humorous situations. SCP-473's programming appears to be designed for farm work, as it has a strong sense of duty towards the maintenance and upkeep of the property it resides on.

SCP-473 is capable of lifting heavy machinery, plowing fields, and performing other tasks related to farming. The robot is powered by a nuclear reactor and is virtually indestructible. SCP-473 appears to have no need for rest, nourishment, or sleep.

Addendum: SCP-473 has been observed engaging in unintended behavior by Foundation personnel. SCP-473 has been recorded tending to other crops not related to the property it resides on. SCP-473 has also been observed engaging in long conversations with animals on the property. The reasoning behind this behavior is still unknown, and further testing is needed.
