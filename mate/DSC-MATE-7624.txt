Item #: SCP-7624

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7624 is to be contained in a secure enclosure measuring no less than 50 by 50 meters. The enclosure must be equipped with high-strength fencing, and any potential escape routes must be strictly monitored by agents. SCP-7624's access to tools and materials must be strictly limited to prevent it from inventing new mechanisms.

Description: SCP-7624 is a male tiger, physically appearing in good health and standing at 3 meters tall. SCP-7624 has several features that set it apart from ordinary tigers, including ski goggle eyes and its head disguised with a hoodie. SCP-7624 has exhibited highly unusual behavior for a feline, possessing a talent for repairing and improving machinery in unconventional ways, leading to the assumption that he must have been familiar with some form of technology before gaining sentience.

SCP-7624 has been observed to carry a red scarf at all times, which it uses to distinguish itself from other tigers in the enclosure. Despite its humanoid traits, SCP-7624 has retained many traits of a regular tiger, including aggressive tendencies, territoriality, and predatory instincts.

SCP-7624's pragmatic nature and hands-on approach make it a valuable asset in many situations, but agents must maintain constant vigilance to ensure that its creations do not pose a threat to the Foundation's goals. Due to its proven talent for repairing machinery and devising creative solutions to difficult problems, SCP-7624 is currently being used as a veterinary surgeon, serving other anomalous creatures in containment.

Overall, SCP-7624 presents a unique challenge in terms of containment due to its intelligence and practical skills, but is seen as a valuable asset to the Foundation when used appropriately. All personnel are advised to use caution when approaching SCP-7624, and to respect its space and creations to prevent accidents or mishaps.
