SCP-3292 is a notorious Mafia Boss with a penchant for flashy accessories and a distinct appearance. His red beanie is a common sight on the streets, as are his normal glasses that give him a false sense of security. However, it is his two facial features that set SCP-3292 apart - a strange mouth spot that seems to move of its own accord and a frightened mouth that trembles often, giving the impression that he is in deep thought.

Despite his intimidating reputation, SCP-3292 is actually quite personable and enjoys brainstorming new ideas. He is often seen in meetings, throwing out outlandish solutions to problems, just for the sake of eliciting reactions from his peers. His natural charm and ability to work a crowd make him an asset to any organization.

Approach with caution, however, as SCP-3292 is known to be fiercely protective of those he considers his own. His silver chain and gold earring are symbols of his power and status within the underworld, and any perceived threat to his authority will be met with swift and brutal retaliation.

Do not underestimate SCP-3292's intelligence, as it has been suggested that his natural brainstorming abilities may extend beyond the criminal underworld. All interactions with SCP-3292 must be monitored closely, and any information gleaned from him should be considered valuable intel.
