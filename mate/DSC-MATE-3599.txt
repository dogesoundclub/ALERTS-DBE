Item #: SCP-3599

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3599 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel interacting with SCP-3599 should refrain from engaging in activities that promote unnecessary risk-taking behavior. Any requests made by SCP-3599 for materials or equipment deemed hazardous must be approved by no less than two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3599 is a male humanoid identified as a programmer by profession. SCP-3599's most notable feature is its clown mouth, blue clown eyes, and purple cap with a headset. It also features a two-colored band on its forehead, gold earring on its ears, and wears a red scarf around its neck, often holding a candy stick.

SCP-3599 displays a love for adventure, frequently attempting risky activities or experiencing thrill-seeking behavior. Although potentially humorous, these traits have put SCP-3599 in some dangerous situations.

Notably, SCP-3599 once survived a near-death experience while bungee jumping and accidentally got lost in the wilderness, making it clear that SCP-3599 should be subject to containment guidelines.

Addendum: SCP-3599 has requested permission to participate in a forthcoming parasailing activity. Following a thorough investigation by ethical review boards, SCP-3599's request has been denied due to the risk to SCP-3599's safety.
