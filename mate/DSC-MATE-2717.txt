Item #: SCP-2717

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2717 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to its occupation as a train driver, it is allowed to continue working as long as it adheres to a strict schedule provided by the Foundation.

Description: SCP-2717, also known as the "Smiling Train Driver," is a male human with red clown eyes. SCP-2717 wears a police cap, a gold earring, a silver chain, and frequently smokes cigarettes. Despite its cheerful demeanor and happy-go-lucky personality, SCP-2717 has a tendency to forget important information and get lost easily. Its forgetfulness has led to humorous situations, such as missing important appointments and getting lost while trying to find a new place.

It has an affinity for trains and will go to great lengths to ensure the safety and efficiency of its routes. SCP-2717 possesses an uncanny ability to navigate train tracks and can sense potential hazards along its routes.

SCP-2717 has shown no evidence of anomalous abilities and has cooperated fully with Foundation personnel. However, caution is advised when dealing with SCP-2717, as its forgetfulness and erratic behavior can pose a danger to itself and others.

Addendum: SCP-2717 has expressed interest in accessing the Foundation's database of locomotive information. The request has been denied due to the potential breach of classified information. SCP-2717 has expressed disappointment but has not shown any signs of hostility towards Foundation personnel.
