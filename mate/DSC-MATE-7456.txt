SCP-7456, also known as Officer Stripes, is a female police officer with a distinctive appearance that often draws attention from civilians. Her face is adorned with orange stripes, which blend seamlessly with her orange eyebrow and retro cap. A pair of gold earrings embellish her ears, while a silver chain hangs from her neck, serving as a symbol of her commitment to justice. 

Despite her eccentric appearance, Officer Stripes is known for her exceptional professionalism and dedication to her job. She has a reputation for being one of the most caring and nurturing individuals on the force, going above and beyond for her colleagues and the community. However, her compassionate nature can sometimes extend to inanimate objects, leading her to assign names to her car, talk to her plants, and even anthropomorphize household appliances. 

Officer Stripes possesses a natural charm and charisma that makes her a valuable asset to any investigation. She is skilled in both verbal communication and physical combat, making her a formidable opponent to any criminals standing in her way. Although she may appear unusual, she is an accomplished police officer and an indispensable member of the SCP Foundation's urban fantasy division.
