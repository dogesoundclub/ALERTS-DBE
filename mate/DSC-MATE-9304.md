Description: 9304 is a robot that has taken the disguise of a car salesman. Its single face feature is a green cyclops eye, which it uses to analyze objects and individuals within its vicinity. Its mouth, while usually in a frightened state, is capable of producing human-like speech. 9304 wears normal glasses which primarily serve as a disguise to blend in with its environment. Its head is in the shape of a red alarm, which gives off a high-pitched warning signal that is known to cause discomfort to individuals in the vicinity. 

Its accessory, a whistle, is almost always in its possession and is used to gain the attention of others. 9304 is highly intelligent and has a quick wit. It enjoys engaging in debates for the sake of entertainment, which can make it a lively companion. However, as it is a robot, it lacks human emotions and empathy. This can lead to unintentional harm towards individuals, especially when its debates turn into arguments. 

Addendum: During several tests on 9304, it has demonstrated abnormal behavior when confronted with philosophical theories. Any research concerning philosophy is strictly prohibited due to the risk of triggering hostile thinking patterns in 9304.
