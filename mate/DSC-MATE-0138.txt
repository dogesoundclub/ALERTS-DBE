SCP-138, also known as "The Boss", is a highly dangerous individual and the leader of a notorious mafia syndicate known for their brutality and cunning. Despite being a rabbit, SCP-138 commands respect and fear from his underlings and rivals alike. 

SCP-138 is easily identifiable by his purple cap adorned with a headset, his VR Jade LED eyes, and his gold earring. His most distinctive feature, however, is his constantly frightened mouth, which gives him a perpetually anxious expression. 

Despite his fearsome reputation, SCP-138 has a surprisingly humorous and lighthearted personality. He enjoys making others laugh and often uses humor to ease tensions and defuse confrontations. His comedic talents include telling funny stories, doing silly impersonations, and even using his whistle to mimic popular tunes. 

However, it is important to remember that SCP-138 is not to be underestimated. He is a ruthless mafia boss who will stop at nothing to protect his empire, and any attempt to cross him or his organization will be met with swift and brutal retaliation. Approach with extreme caution.
