Item #: 877

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 877, identified by their distinctive spots and blue clown eyes, must be monitored at all times for any attempts to bend or break the law. As a lawyer, they possess knowledge of legal loopholes and are therefore considered a potential security threat to the Foundation.

Subject 877 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit with reinforced walls and airtight seals. They must wear a medical mask at all times to prevent any possible contamination from their saliva. Any attempts to remove or tamper with the mask must be reported immediately.

All interactions with Subject 877 must be carried out with caution, as they have a tendency to be rebellious and may attempt to manipulate or bend the rules for their own amusement. A team of trained personnel is to be assigned to monitor and handle all communications with the subject.

Description: Subject 877 is a human female approximately 1.7 meters tall. They have a distinctive pattern of spots on their skin and blue clown eyes that are usually covered with a set of goggles resting on their forehead. Their retro cap and green cross earring complete their unique appearance.

Personality: Subject 877 has been known to display a mischievous streak, often breaking rules or finding ways to bend them for their amusement. They take pleasure in pushing boundaries and defying authority, even going so far as to use their knowledge of legal loopholes to do so. This can lead to humorous situations, but also makes them a potential security threat to the Foundation. Subject 877 should be handled with caution at all times.

Note: Subject 877 has expressed interest in working alongside the Foundation to uncover any legal issues related to the containment of anomalous objects or entities. Their expertise in this area could prove valuable in future investigations. However, their potential motives should be closely monitored at all times.
