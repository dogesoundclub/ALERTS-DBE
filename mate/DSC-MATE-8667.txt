Description: SCP-8667 is a male human traffic officer identified by identification number 8667. SCP-8667 stands at 5'11" tall and is of average build. SCP-8667's face features a permanently frightened mouth, which is believed to be a result of a previous traumatic experience. SCP-8667's eyes are obscured by normal glasses and he wears a monk's hood over his head. SCP-8667 sports a single gold earring and a gold chain as accessories, and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-8667 has a personality that is at odds with his appearance; he possesses a natural charm and charisma and can easily become the life of the party. SCP-8667 has been observed telling jokes and dancing in a humorous manner to bring laughter to those around him. Despite this, SCP-8667 is often overcome by fear and panic in stressful situations, which makes him difficult to work with.

SCP-8667's primary duties involve regulating traffic and ensuring that motorists follow traffic laws. SCP-8667 has been found to be particularly efficient at this task due to his commanding presence and natural authority. SCP-8667 has been known to issue fines to individuals who fail to comply with traffic laws, and is infamous among motorists for his stern approach.

Addendum: SCP-8667 became an anomaly in 20██ after being involved in a car accident with an uncontained paranormal entity. Further investigation revealed that SCP-8667 had developed latent psionic abilities, which allowed him to sense certain aspects of the paranormal. SCP-8667's abilities are currently being studied to better understand their nature and potential application in the field of containment.
