Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3072 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to SCP-3072 is granted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. SCP-3072 is to be transported with caution, as their reluctance to ask for help may result in injury or damage to the containment cell.

Description: SCP-3072 is a human female of average height and build, with distinctive spots on their face and a red lip. They wear normal glasses and a retro cap on their head, and a jade earring on each of their ears. SCP-3072 often accessorizes with a choker, and a LED gas mask.

SCP-3072 posses a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. They often refuse offers of assistance, even when facing tasks beyond their capability. SCP-3072’s stubbornness and reluctance to ask for help has led them into humorous situations such as attempting to move heavy objects by themselves or wandering lost without using a map.

SCP-3072 claims to be a theater manager, though no records of their employment have been found. They show no special abilities or anomalous features, but their tendency towards independence may pose a risk to containment in certain situations.

Further inspection of SCP-3072’s background and connection to the anomalous is ongoing.
