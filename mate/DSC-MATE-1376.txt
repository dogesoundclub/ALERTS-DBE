Item #: 1376

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1376, also known as "Reporter Rabbit," is currently under Foundation custody in a standard humanoid containment chamber, fitted with a pressure plate in case of escape attempts. The chamber must be kept at a temperature between 17-22Â°C and monitored for any signs of emotional distress or heightened anxiety in the subject. Access to Subject 1376 is limited to personnel with level 2 clearance or higher, and all visits must be pre-approved by at least two senior researchers.

Description: Subject 1376 appears to be a male rabbit of the Leporidae family, standing at approximately 3 feet tall on two legs. The subject is outfitted with VR Jade LED eyes, a police cap on its head, and a Jade Earring on each ear. Additionally, the subject is frequently seen sporting a gold chain necklace and a candy stick in its mouth. Subject 1376 exhibits anthropomorphic traits, including the ability to communicate in fluent English and possesses remarkable organizational skills.

Personality: Reporter Rabbit is highly focused, goal-oriented, and ambitious, making it well-suited for its job as an investigative reporter for the "Lagomorph Gazette." It has a knack for strategic thinking and problem-solving, which enables it to manage to handle multiple tasks simultaneously effectively. Despite its strengths, the subject often takes on more than it can handle, which has led to exhaustion and burn-out in the past.

Addendum: According to reports from witnesses, Subject 1376 was spotted investigating supernatural anomalies and paranormal activities in the city, leading some to believe that it's not an ordinary rabbit but a person wearing a costume. The Foundation is currently investigating these claims to determine if any anomalous properties are at play.
