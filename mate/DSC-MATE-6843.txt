SCP-6843, also known as "The Rabbit Conductor", is a mysterious creature with the appearance of a common domestic rabbit, though with one major addition - cybernetic enhancements. The creature has been outfitted with a set of shimmering VR Rainbow LED eyes, and an intricate Jade Earring accenting its long ears. Additionally, SCP-6843 is often seen wearing a shimmering Silver Chain and carrying a colorful Candy Stick, used to sweeten any situation.

The true nature of SCP-6843 remains a mystery, but the creature has taken on the occupation of Train Driver with an almost unearthly enthusiasm. Reports suggest that SCP-6843 exhibits an impulsive personality, with a willingness to act on emotion over logic. While this may lead to humorous moments, such as unexpected detours or impromptu stops, it can also cause great concern for those who encounter SCP-6843 in their travels.

Due to the strange nature of SCP-6843, Foundation personnel have been instructed to monitor the creature closely and gather any additional information about its origins, motives, and potential danger to the public. If approached by SCP-6843, individuals are advised to exercise caution and report any sightings or interactions to the Foundation immediately.
