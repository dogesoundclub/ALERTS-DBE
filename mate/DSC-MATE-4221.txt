SCP-4221 stands at approximately 6 ft tall and is designed to resemble a humanoid entity.

SCP-4221 was discovered in a warehouse in [REDACTED]. The robot's creator is unknown, as SCP-4221 lacks any identifying markings or serial numbers. It is believed that SCP-4221 was designed for industrial use, but its capabilities have since expanded.

Addendum: Despite SCP-4221's usefulness, it is not to be considered a sentient being, as it lacks the ability to experience emotions and operates solely based on programmed logic. Any suggestions otherwise are to be immediately dismissed.
