Item #: 9704

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9704 is currently deemed a low risk to society by the Foundation and is allowed to continue their job as a delivery driver. However, they are to be monitored closely for any signs of supernatural abilities or unusual behavior. Any deviations from normal human behavior should be reported immediately to the assigned Foundation liaison.

Description: Subject 9704 is a human male in his mid-twenties with striking orange stripes on his face. He possesses green hair, which he keeps styled under a purple cap, and sports a green cross earring on one ear. In addition, he wears a gold chain as an accessory. Despite his unusual choices in fashion, his appearance is otherwise unremarkable.

Personality: Subject 9704 has a highly analytical and logical personality. He enjoys debating and arguing with others frequently, especially over trivial or unimportant topics. This trait often leads to humorous situations, where he becomes increasingly heated in his argument as others become increasingly bewildered by his passionate defense of what seems to be a small issue.

Further observations of subject 9704 have noted an increase in the frequency and intensity of his debate performances. It is uncertain what this indicates, but the Foundation is monitoring the situation closely.

In conclusion, subject 9704 should be treated with caution, as his strange personality may have supernatural roots. He is harmless at present, but we must remain vigilant to ensure the safety of the public.
