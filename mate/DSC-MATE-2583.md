Item #: 2583

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2583 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear Level 2 protective gear and must undergo a mental evaluation before and after their interaction with DSC-MATE-2583. Any testing or experiments involving DSC-MATE-2583 must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-2583 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 65 cm in height. The subject appears to have green hair and wears a purple cap, a pair of nerd glasses, and a Jade Earring. On DSC-MATE-2583's forehead is a pair of goggles, and the subject often carries a lit cigarette.

DSC-MATE-2583 displays a strong sense of intuition that has been known to border on psychic powers. The subject has been observed to predict events before they occur and can sense the emotions of those around them. DSC-MATE-2583 can perceive when individuals are feeling anxious or upset, which can be both impressive and unsettling.

The anomaly was discovered working as a banker and successfully passed a standard background check before being recruited by the Foundation. DSC-MATE-2583 has been cooperative under containment and expresses a desire to be useful to the Foundation.

Addendum: Research has shown that DSC-MATE-2583's abilities may be enhanced by its cigarette smoke. Testing is ongoing to determine any potential long-term side effects of this phenomenon. In the meantime, smoking is only permitted under controlled conditions and with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel.
