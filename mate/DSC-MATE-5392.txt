Item #: SCP-5392

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5392 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with basic accommodations for daily activities. SCP-5392 is to be monitored for any signs of distress or anxiety, and any requests for assistance must be promptly addressed.

Description: SCP-5392 appears to be a human male of average height and build, with a distinctive facial feature - a dark spot on their upper lip resembling a mouth. The mouth spot does not exhibit any anomalous properties and is likely a birthmark or genetic abnormality. In addition, SCP-5392's mouth is often contorted into a frightened expression, as if they are in a perpetual state of fear or anxiety.

SCP-5392 also wears a distinctive Doge hat on their head, and a jade earring on their left ear. Both of these items appear to be non-anomalous and are likely simply fashion choices.

SCP-5392's personality is characterized by a strong sense of independence and a reluctance to ask for help, even when it is necessary. This can lead to comical situations, such as SCP-5392 attempting to move heavy objects alone or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. It is unknown whether this personality trait is a result of SCP-5392's anomalous properties or simply a quirk of their individual personality.

SCP-5392's job as an electrician does not appear to be related to their anomalous properties, and they have not exhibited any unusual abilities or tendencies related to their work. However, due to their independent nature, SCP-5392 should not be given access to electrical equipment without supervision.

Addendum: SCP-5392 has expressed a fear of the dark and a preference for well-lit environments. This may be related to their anomalous properties or simply a personal preference. SCP-5392 should be provided with adequate lighting at all times to prevent anxiety or distress.
