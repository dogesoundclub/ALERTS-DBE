Item #: SCP-7096

Object Class: Euclid-Possible Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7096 is currently employed by a railway company in [REDACTED] city. Foundation agents have been stationed at the train station to deter unauthorized personnel from interacting with SCP-7096. SCP-7096 is to be monitored by agents at all times while operating the train. Any unusual behavior by SCP-7096 is to be reported immediately to site security.

Description: SCP-7096 appears to be a monkey wearing a red beanie and glasses. Its frightened mouth suggests that it is easily intimidated. SCP-7096 speaks in a language unknown to humans but is fluent in several railway-related commands. SCP-7096 has two distinct color bands on its forehead and wears a jade earring in its left ear.

SCP-7096's personality is characterized by a strong sense of duty and responsibility. It has been observed taking on more than it can handle in order to fulfill its obligations, resulting in humorous situations like trying to carry too many things at once or running to complete tasks in a single day. SCP-7096 appears to be highly intelligent and is capable of driving the train with precision despite its physical limitations.

SCP-7096's origins are unknown. However, a possible link between SCP-7096 and the SCP-███ incident has been hypothesized. Further investigation is ongoing.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-7096's train experienced a catastrophic derailment, resulting in over 60 casualties. SCP-7096 was found unharmed at the scene and claimed responsibility for the incident, stating that it had been distracted by a group of children outside the train. Further testing and analysis are needed to determine the extent of SCP-7096's capabilities and intentions.
