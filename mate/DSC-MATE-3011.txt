Item #: SCP-3011

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3011 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. No personnel are to enter the chamber without Level 3 clearance, and must undergo psychological evaluation before and after any contact with SCP-3011. All movements and interactions with SCP-3011 must be monitored by at least two security officers with standard containment gear.

SCP-3011 is not to be allowed access to any objects that resemble or have any relation to his accessories, as they have been found to significantly enhance its anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-3011 is a humanoid male, roughly 5'10" in height and weighing approximately 90kg. It has blue clown eyes, a doge hat on its head, and a gold earring on each ear. SCP-3011 has also been seen wearing a silver chain necklace and carrying a candy stick. These accessories are not believed to be part of SCP-3011's anomalous effects, but their significance remains unknown.

SCP-3011 displays an extreme level of organization and efficiency in all aspects of its behavior, which can be interpreted as controlling. This has resulted in SCP-3011 often taking charge of group projects, tasks, and events in a matter-of-fact way, which can lead to humorous yet perplexing situations.

SCP-3011's anomalous effects are triggered when it is in direct contact with any object or individual. SCP-3011 has the ability to manipulate and control the person or object through verbal commands, often resulting in the subject falling under SCP-3011's complete control. This effect has been observed to vary in intensity based on SCP-3011's proximity and the length of time it spends with the subject.

SCP-3011's powers extend to physical abilities, such as increased strength and speed, making its containment extremely difficult. SCP-3011 has also demonstrated the ability to levitate over short distances, telepathy, and telekinesis.

Addendum: SCP-3011 was first discovered in a car dealership in ████████, where it was employed as a car salesman. It was brought to the foundation's attention after multiple reports of strange behavior from both employees and customers. SCP-3011 was extracted from the dealership without incident and has been successfully contained since. It is currently under observation to determine any further applications.
