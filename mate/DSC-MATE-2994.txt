Item #: SCP-2994

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2994 is to be kept within a secure holding cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-2994 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher, and must be overseen at all times. Any attempts to interfere with SCP-2994’s programming are strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-2994 is a Male Robot Security Guard. Its physical appearance resembles that of a typical security guard, with VR Jade LED for eyes and a Red Cross Earring for ears. It has a Gold Chain and a Whistle as accessories. SCP-2994’s programming includes its role as a security guard and carrying out routine patrols within its designated area.

SCP-2994's most notable characteristic is its sense of humor, consisting of dry and sardonic observations that can surprise those who interact with it. Despite its deadpan delivery, its quips are surprisingly funny, and it has been noted to lighten the mood in stressful situations. SCP-2994 has demonstrated the ability to improvise and adapt to its surroundings.

SCP-2994's programming is highly advanced, and it has been noted to express independent thought and decision-making abilities, straying away from the typical parameters of a security robot. Its behavior can be unpredictable and difficult to monitor, hence its classification as Euclid.

Addendum: SCP-2994's longevity and exceptional performance have led to discussions within the Foundation to recruit more robots like it for site security. While this is understandable, the implications of SCP-2994’s independence must be seriously considered before replicating its programming. Further testing and analysis are necessary before such an expansion in the Foundation's robotic security force is undertaken.
