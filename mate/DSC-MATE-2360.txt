Item #: SCP-2360

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2360 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. No personnel are to interact with SCP-2360 unless authorized by at least Level 3 personnel. All communication is to be conducted through a speaker system in SCP-2360's cell.

Description: SCP-2360 appears to be a male monkey of an unknown species, with green fur that does not arrange itself in any particular pattern. SCP-2360 wears horned rim glasses over its eyes, and a pair of goggles on its forehead. It also wears a red scarf around its neck and has a jade earring in its left ear. SCP-2360 is often seen smoking a cigarette.

Despite its appearance, SCP-2360 possesses human-like intelligence and a strong understanding of the world of finance. It works as a banker outside of Foundation purview, which was how it was initially discovered. SCP-2360 is known to be very outgoing and sociable, often enjoying the center of attention.

However, SCP-2360's social tendencies and humor can also be unpredictable and dangerous. Its jokes and stories can often cause uncontrollable laughter in those around it, leading to accidents and injury. SCP-2360 has also been known to use its charm to manipulate others for its own gain.

Addendum: After initial containment, SCP-2360 was interviewed by Foundation personnel. It seems to be aware of its anomalous properties, but claims to have no explanation for how it acquired them. It has been cooperative with containment procedures, but has expressed a desire to continue working as a banker. This request is currently under review by Ethics Committee.
