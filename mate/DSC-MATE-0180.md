Item #: DSC-MATE-180

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-180 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber reinforced with steel plating. The chamber must be equipped with a fire extinguishing system and reinforced with fire-resistant materials. DSC-MATE-180 is to be provided with a monitored smoking area and a special diet consisting of raw meat and water. All personnel entering DSC-MATE-180's containment chamber must wear fire-resistant gear and take caution due to the increased risk of accidental fires.

Description: DSC-MATE-180 appears as a male Bengal tiger standing at 1.8 meters in height. DSC-MATE-180's head is not arranged in a normal tiger fashion, instead of a permanent green Mohawk-like crest on the top of its head. DSC-MATE-180's eyes resemble those of a clown's, with blue irises and enlarged pupils. DSC-MATE-180 has two color bands on its forehead and a goggle worn on top of its forehead. Additionally, DSC-MATE-180 is often seen wearing a silver chain around its neck and smoking a cigarette between its claws.

DSC-MATE-180 is a highly skilled firefighter and is equipped with exceptional senses and agility, making it highly effective in rescue and firefighting operations. DSC-MATE-180's personality is often characterized as absent-minded and forgetful, often leading to humorous situations. Despite its forgetful nature, DSC-MATE-180 is highly intelligent and resourceful in high-pressure situations.

DSC-MATE-180's diet consists primarily of raw meat due to its carnivorous nature. It possesses the ability to manipulate fire in a limited manner, allowing it to control small flames and generate sparks from its claws. This ability is believed to be connected to the anomaly that caused the alteration of DSC-MATE-180's physical appearance.

Addendum: Incident Report 180-A: On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-180 inadvertently started a fire in its containment chamber due to smoking in a non-designated area. Fortunately, the fire extinguishing system was activated, and no casualties or damage to the facility were reported. As a result of this incident, DSC-MATE-180's smoking area was modified, and its smoking habit was closely monitored by personnel.
