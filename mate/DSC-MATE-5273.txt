Item #: SCP-5273

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5273 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the chamber is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher and requires written approval from at least two researchers.

SCP-5273 is permitted to continue its work as a police officer, under the supervision of Foundation agents posing as superiors. SCP-5273 is not to be allowed access to cases involving anomalous activity, and any suspicious behavior or activity is to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-5273 is a female human police officer of average height and build, with orange stripes on her face and a constant smile. Her eyes are unremarkable, though she wears normal glasses. SCP-5273 also has a band of two colors on her forehead and a green cross earring on each ear. She wears a choker that cannot be removed.

SCP-5273 displays an unusual amount of empathy and understanding towards others, particularly those in pain or distress. She may become emotional, even to the point of tears or outbursts, when witnessing someone else's suffering. SCP-5273's personality also includes a fondness for animals and nature.

It has been established that SCP-5273 is not affected by any known anomalous properties. However, due to her empathetic nature, it is possible that SCP-5273 may inadvertently become involved in cases involving anomalous activity.

Addendum: Despite SCP-5273's non-anomalous nature, it has been noted that her presence has a calming effect on some anomalous entities, particularly those with emotional or psychological disturbances. Further research may be needed to fully understand the extent of SCP-5273's influence.
