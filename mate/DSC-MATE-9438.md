Description: DSC-MATE-9438 appears to be a young human male in his mid-20s who works as a beautician. They are approximately 183cm tall and weigh approximately 81kg. DSC-MATE-9438's most noticeable facial features are the "Mouth Spot" on their right cheek and their permanent smile. DSC-MATE-9438's eyes resemble ski goggles, and they often sport a short peak cap on their head. DSC-MATE-9438 can usually be seen with goggles resting on their forehead, and they wear a green cross earring in their left ear. 

DSC-MATE-9438's mouth is always covered by a medical mask, and they often wear a gold chain around their neck. DSC-MATE-9438's personality has been noted to be very observant and attentive to details, making them an excellent gift-giver. However, DSC-MATE-9438 can also become overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone.

DSC-MATE-9438 was discovered by a local police officer after they had been reported to be behaving erratically in a store. After being taken into custody, it was discovered that DSC-MATE-9438 had been using their gift-giving abilities to manipulate people into giving them things that they wanted. DSC-MATE-9438 was later identified as an anomaly and brought into Foundation custody.

DSC-MATE-9438 seems to be unaware of their anomalous abilities and has no memory of using them to manipulate anyone. DSC-MATE-9438 has stated that they enjoy making people feel happy and that they take pride in their work as a beautician. DSC-MATE-9438 has been cooperative with the Foundation and has expressed a desire to learn more about their abilities. Research into DSC-MATE-9438's anomalous abilities is ongoing.
