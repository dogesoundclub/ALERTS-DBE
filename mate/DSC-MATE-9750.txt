SCP Foundation File #9750:

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9750 is to be contained in a standard animal containment unit, equipped with climbing structures and toys appropriate for a primate. SCP-9750 is allowed to leave its containment unit for its designated work period as a traffic officer, but must wear its LED gas mask at all times while outside of containment.

Description: SCP-9750 is a male monkey measuring approximately 60 cm in height and weighing approximately 10 kg. SCP-9750 exhibits traits consistent with the Java macaque species, including a short tail and a gray-brown fur covering most of its body.

SCP-9750 is distinguishable from other macaques by its purple cap, gold earring, and gold chain. SCP-9750 also wears a LED gas mask over its face at all times while outside of containment, which has been modified with a speaker and microphone to allow for communication with humans.

Despite its appearance, SCP-9750 possesses advanced intelligence and has been trained to operate as a traffic officer. SCP-9750 is able to understand and follow basic commands from its human superiors, and is able to use its LED gas mask to communicate with drivers and pedestrians.

SCP-9750 also exhibits a unique personality, displaying a strong sense of duty and responsibility to its assigned duties as a traffic officer. However, SCP-9750 is also known to have a playful and mischievous side, sometimes using its communication device to play music or make prank calls while on duty.

As such, SCP-9750 must be monitored while outside of containment to ensure its behavior remains appropriate and does not compromise its duties as a traffic officer.
