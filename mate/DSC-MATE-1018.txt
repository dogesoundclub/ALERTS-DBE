Item #: 1018

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1018 is a police officer of the rabbit species, with a purple cap and headset, and a gold chain. The subject is to be monitored and observed in its daily activities, and must be kept under surveillance when off-duty. The subject is to be contained within a designated area, where its needs can be met, and any attempts to leave the containment must be deterred.

Description: SCP-1018 is a male rabbit with an idealistic personality. The subject often displays a strong desire to make the world a better place, which leads to its participation in various social movements and causes. SCP-1018's purple cap and headset are tools used to communicate with fellow officers, while its gold chain is a source of pride.

SCP-1018 displays a unique anomaly, as its ability to make others see the world through its eyes is unparalleled. SCP-1018 has been known to influence members of the public to join its causes, and in some cases, even change their viewpoint on certain topics. This anomaly has been noted as a potential threat to the Foundation's secrecy, as it puts the general public at risk of exposure to anomalous activity.

SCP-1018 is highly rational and intelligent, making it difficult to deceive or manipulate. However, it is emotionally vulnerable, and its strong beliefs can be exploited.

Addendum 1018-1: SCP-1018 has been observed to have a strong connection with fellow animal SCPs, exhibiting a level of teamwork and communication not seen among other individuals of the same species. Further research is recommended to examine the significance of this bond among SCPs.
