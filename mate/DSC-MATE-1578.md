Item #: 1578

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1578, also known as "The Delivery Driver," must be monitored at all times during working hours. A GPS tracking device has been installed on the vehicle subject 1578 uses for deliveries. This is to ensure that the subject does not deviate from their assigned delivery route.

Any deviations should be reported immediately to MTF Zeta-9 "Mole Rats." A team of two agents is to be sent out to investigate immediately. Agents are required to wear level A hazmat suits at all times when handling Subject 1578.

Description: Subject 1578 is a male of human origin, approximately 5'11" with a slim build. The subject's most notable feature is the orange stripes on their face. Subject 1578 also has red clown eyes and wears a medical mask. They wear a bucket hat on their head and have green cross earrings on their earlobes. The subject has a two-color band on their forehead.

Subject 1578 can be a bit rebellious and enjoys pushing boundaries. They have been documented bending and breaking rules just to see what happens. The subject has a contagious smile which can be disarming at times.

Subject 1578 is employed as a delivery driver for a local restaurant chain. The subject has shown no signs of abnormal behavior while off duty.

Addendum 1578-1: On 11/15/20, Subject 1578 was reported to have deviated from their assigned delivery route. Agents were dispatched to investigate, and subject 1578 was found performing what appeared to be a summoning ritual within a local park.

Subject 1578 was noncompliant and confrontational, requiring the use of physical force to subdue. The subject was transported to Site-██ for containment and interrogation.

Following questioning, the subject claimed to have been "just playing around" and had no knowledge of the true purpose of the ritual. Subject 1578's employment status is currently being reviewed.

Addendum 1578-2: Due to repeated incidents of defiance and lack of cooperation, Subject 1578's object class has been upgraded to Keter. New containment procedures are currently being drafted.
