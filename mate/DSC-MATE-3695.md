Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained within a standard humanoid holding cell. Subject should be allowed access to books, television, and other forms of entertainment to alleviate boredom. Personnel interacting with Subject are not to make physical contact, as subject may become aggressive.

Description: Subject appears to be a male tiger in his mid-twenties. The subject wears horned rim glasses, a goggle on his forehead, a red cross earring in his left ear, and a red scarf around his neck. Subject's most peculiar trait is the LED gas mask he wears over his muzzle, which emits a soft blue light. The purpose of the mask remains unknown.

Personality: Subject exhibits a jovial and humorous demeanor, often making those around him smile and laugh. However, his sense of humor may sometimes border on the inappropriate, making him unpredictable. Subject may become aggressive when provoked or when his sense of humor is not appreciated.

Due to his unusual appearance, Subject was discovered working at a fast-food restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, often entertaining patrons with his humor. The Foundation intervened after reports of his peculiar behavior and abnormal strength surfaced. Subject was easily apprehended but put up a surprisingly tough fight upon being restrained.

Addendum: During an interview, Subject claimed to have no memory of his past before working at the fast-food restaurant. Subject expressed a desire to leave containment and return to his previous life. However, due to unpredictable behavior and remarkable strength, it is not deemed safe for Subject to leave containment at this time. Further research is required to determine the source of Subject's anomalous appearance and abilities.
