SCP Foundation Report: 

Item #: SCP-661

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-661 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Under no circumstances should SCP-661 be allowed to interact with personnel outside of specified testing scenarios. All communication with SCP-661 must be conducted through securely screened video or audio channels.

SCP-661 is to be kept restrained during all testing, and all experimental equipment is to be checked and verified by at least two Level 3 personnel prior to use. Access to SCP-661 is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-661, also known by its preferred alias of "the Banker", is a humanoid entity of female gender that appears to be a human being. However, it possesses several anomalous features that separate it from the average human.

SCP-661 has a purple-colored lip that seems to be naturally present, and its eyes display a rainbow of LED lights that pulse and glow in an unchanging pattern. Its head has a distinct orange side, which appears to be a genetic mutation. Its ears hold a single red cross earring and its mouth is obscured by a medical mask.

SCP-661 also wears a choker, although it is unclear if this item of clothing has any anomalous properties. SCP-661 displays an outgoing personality that is quick to smile and consume humor. It has been recorded telling jokes and making others laugh, which can lead to humorous and unpredictable situations.

SCP-661 has a powerful cognitohazardous effect that causes individuals to perceive it as trustworthy and knowledgeable, regardless of prior personal experiences. It has been observed to have been able to override the will of several individuals, causing them to carry out tasks and actions that they may ordinarily have refused or found objectionable.

Addendum: SCP-661 was collected by Foundation agents following reports of unusual activities occurring at its place of employment. During the initial physical examination of SCP-661, it was noted that it possessed relatively few biological differences from a normal human, barring the previously listed abnormalities. SCP-661's precise mode of activation, as well as its origins or powers, have yet to be fully determined.
