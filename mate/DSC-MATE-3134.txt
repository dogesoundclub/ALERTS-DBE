Description: SCP-3134 is a male sentient tiger with the occupation of an electrician. Its eyes are framed with normal glasses, and its head is adorned with a purple cap and a headset. A two-color band can be found on its forehead, and a red cross earring within its left ear.

SCP-3134 is generally mild-mannered and empathetic, quickly attuning itself to the emotions of others. This has been known to cause humorous or oftentimes bizarre situations. Furthermore, SCP-3134 is capable of making others feel at ease or see the humor in a difficult circumstance.

However, it is of note that SCP-3134 is highly sensitive to loud noises or sudden shocks, as its tiger instincts can quickly take over. Its medical mask is used to help prevent any injuries caused by its sharp teeth.

Addendum: SCP-3134 has been proven to be quite proficient in electrical work, and has been approved for use in the Foundation's electrical teams. SCP-3134 is to work under the supervision of a trained electrician at all times.
