Item #: 8165

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 8165 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. It is to be provided with grooming tools and facilities; these are deemed necessary for its maintenance. Regular physical examinations are required, and specialized treatment is to be provided in the event of a medical emergency.

Description: 8165 is a male monkey creature with terrifying clown blue eyes and a frightened mouth. This monkey has an inexplicable talent for leadership and is often the leader of the pack. Its leadership is so natural that it may be seen in both professional and social contexts.

8165 has adopted specific accessories - a gold chain and a whistle - which it carries around and appears to rely on. These objects may affect 8165's mood or behavior, so they must be administered carefully.

Personality: 8165 is a born leader, and it knows it. It has an uncanny ability to make decisions promptly, and its decisions are generally well-received by others. It is sociable and approachable but will sometimes show signs of anxiety or stress.

Due to 8165's unpredictability and the risk of agitation, all interactions should be monitored closely.
