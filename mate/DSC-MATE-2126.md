Item #: 2126

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2126 is to be kept in a soundproof enclosure at all times, with plentiful access to his favorite foods and relaxation materials. Due to his ability to argue unnecessarily, interactions with the subject should be kept to a minimum unless absolutely necessary.

Description: Subject 2126 is a male anthropomorphic monkey, with black hair and normal glasses on its eyes. He bears a two-color band on his forehead, and a goggle on his forehead. A jade earring is present in both ears, along with a silver chain around its neck. A candy stick is present at all times in its possession, and it seems to refuse cooperation without it.

Subject 2126 speaks fluently in many languages and exhibits a sharp intellect, with a penchant for debating with anyone that crosses his path, regardless of the subject or time. He enjoys humor and will go to great lengths to make others laugh. Subject 2126 often flaunts his abilities to debate among his peers, which can be a source of annoyance to others.

Addendum: During staff interviews with the subject, it became clear that his debating habits stem from a deep-seated need for mental stimulation. Subject 2126 engages in these highly stimulating and sometimes contentious debates to satisfy an intellectual hunger that is difficult to satisfy. Interaction with him should be done with extreme caution as he is highly manipulative and enjoys playing with people's minds.
