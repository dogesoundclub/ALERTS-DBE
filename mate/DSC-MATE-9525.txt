Description: 9525 is a humanoid automaton designed to resemble a male car salesman. Its body is composed of various metals including aluminum, silver, and steel, with various electronic circuits visible under its skin. Its face features a single green cyclops eye and a mouth that often appears to be in a frightened expression.

In addition to its unusual facial structure, 9525 is often seen wearing normal glasses and a red cross earring. It is often seen with a cigarette in its hand, a habit it developed in order to appear more human-like.

Despite its mechanical nature, 9525 has developed a personality that is both analytical and logical. It is often found making witty observations and teasing its friends in a dry, deadpan way. However, it has also been known to express fear and panic in emergency situations, leading some to question its overall reliability.

Due to its unique abilities and personality, 9525 is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation and will continue to be monitored and studied for the foreseeable future.
