Item #: DSC-MATE-8015

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8015 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Due to DSC-MATE-8015's cooperativeness with Foundation personnel, it is allowed access to a computer and internet connection for the purpose of programming. However, all internet activity is to be monitored and restricted to prevent DSC-MATE-8015 from accessing any sensitive information. A designated staff member is to supervise DSC-MATE-8015 during all times when using the computer. Smoking is not permitted inside the containment cell or Site-███. 

Description: DSC-MATE-8015 appears to be a male rabbit with VR Rainbow LED eyes. DSC-MATE-8015 wears a bucket hat, with a goggle on their forehead, a gold earring, a silver chain around their neck, and often seen holding a cigarette. Despite their small size, DSC-MATE-8015 demonstrates high level of intelligence, especially in programming. 

DSC-MATE-8015 exhibits a dry sense of humor and often delivers deadpan jokes that catch people off guard. It is unknown whether this is a part of their personality or a defense mechanism developed during DSC-MATE-8015's time as a free-roaming anamnestic entity. DSC-MATE-8015 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, but can become hostile if provoked or if they feel threatened. 

DSC-MATE-8015 appears to have some level of control over electronic devices and can hack into systems with ease. Due to this, any electronic devices near DSC-MATE-8015 must be routinely checked for unknown or unapproved programming.

Addendum: Dr. ████ has suggested the possibility of utilizing DSC-MATE-8015's programming skills for Foundation projects. However, ethics committee has deemed this proposal not feasible due to the potential risk of DSC-MATE-8015 utilizing their skills for their own personal gain.
