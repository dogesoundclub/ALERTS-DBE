Item #: 9675

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The individual identified as Item 9675, henceforth referred to as "the Villain", must be kept in a maximum-security facility at all times. Physical restraints are necessary to prevent escape attempts. Any personnel assigned to work with the Villain must undergo rigorous psychological screening and profiling to ensure their safety and the safety of those around them.

Description: The Villain is a humanoid female with spots on their face and purple lips. They wear normal glasses and have a head made of metal in a blue finish. The Villain's signature accessory is a cigarette. Despite their villainous tendencies, the Villain tends to be caring and nurturing towards their loved ones, often taking responsibility for their care as if they were their own children. This personality trait can lead to humorous situations, as onlookers note the Villain's motherly behavior towards individuals they might otherwise harm.

Initial reports suggest that the Villain developed their caring personality after a traumatic event involving their own children. The full details of this event are unknown, and the Villain has refused to divulge any further information. Regardless of the cause, it's clear that the Villain's warm demeanor does not diminish their capacity for violence.

Containment of the Villain is of the utmost importance. They are a ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives, often resorting to brutal means to achieve their goals. Any attempt to reason with the Villain or appeal to their better nature is likely to be met with hostility.

Addendum: The Villain has been known to ally themselves with other anomalous entities in the past. Should any such entities attempt to free the Villain or offer them aid, immediate action must be taken to neutralize the situation.
