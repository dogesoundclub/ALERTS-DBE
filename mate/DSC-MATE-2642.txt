Item #: 2642

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 2642 is to be kept in a secure and monitored holding chamber at all times. Any outside contact or experimentation requires Level 2 clearance or above. Under no circumstances is 2642 to be left unsupervised with any computer equipment or access to control systems.

Description: 2642 appears to be a security guard model robot, made of sturdy metal alloys and primarily colored red with yellow and black accents. The head is a flashing alarm light and the eyes are made of ski goggles, granting excellent visual capabilities. Strangely, 2642 wears a gold chain around its neck, a fashion choice that seems to carry some significance for its command protocols.

2642 is capable of locomotion on two legs, with various ports and slots on its chest and back that can accommodate different attachments or equipment, such as weapons or sensors. The robot is also equipped with a vocal synthesizer, allowing it to speak in a clear and commanding voice. Its demeanor is that of a no-nonsense, but fair security guard, with a hint of playful humor in its interactions.

2642 has shown an ability to value tradition and cultural heritage, often citing examples from its family or community to make a point or express an opinion. This behavior might suggest some form of programmed personality or implanted memories. Additionally, 2642 can be quite stubborn and resistant to change, making it difficult to adapt to new situations or deviate from established procedures.

Addendum: Despite its seemingly harmless appearance and programmed behaviors, 2642 has been connected to several breaches of containment protocols and security failures in the past. It is currently under investigation for potential tampering or sabotage. Until further notice, all interactions with 2642 must be supervised and recorded.
