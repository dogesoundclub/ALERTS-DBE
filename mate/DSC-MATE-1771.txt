Due to their profession, subject is permitted access to a small sewing machine and materials for self-entertainment. Any requests for additional materials must be approved by at least two level-2 personnel.

These spots and streaks are thought to be benign in nature, but should be monitored for any changes. Subject's hair is dyed a vibrant green, and has been left unarranged.
