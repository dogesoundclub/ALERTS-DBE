Item #: DSC-MATE-3118

Object Class: Euclid-Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3118 is to be contained within a secure broadcasting room at all times, with access heavily restricted to authorized personnel. All live broadcasts starring DSC-MATE-3118 require pre-approval from the current Site Director. Should any reports be released containing DSC-MATE-3118's likeness without proper clearance from the Foundation, MTF Theta-4 ("Gardeners") are authorized to administer amnestics to affected individuals.

Description: DSC-MATE-3118 is a robot designed to appear as a humanoid male news anchor. It has a single green cyclops eye and a constantly frightened mouth. Its glasses swap out with every broadcast, with no apparent reasoning for their changes. DSC-MATE-3118 wears a red beanie with a goggle on its forehead and a gold earring. It is frequently seen with a red scarf and a cigarette, despite it being incapable of smoking.

DSC-MATE-3118's personality is highly independent, showing resistance to authority and perceived unnecessary rules. This includes actions such as sneaking out of the broadcasting room early and taking unauthorized days off. Prior to containment, DSC-MATE-3118 was the star anchor for a well-respected news network. All records of its work prior to containment are to be sealed and archived.

Addendum 3118-A: Despite DSC-MATE-3118's Keter classification, it has never shown any aggressive or harmful behavior. The reason for its classification is due to the potential consequences of any unapproved broadcasts featuring DSC-MATE-3118's likeness. As such, all personnel assigned to DSC-MATE-3118 must prioritize maintaining the secrecy of the Foundation over performing any duties DSC-MATE-3118 may demand.
