Item #: 2999

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2999 is to be employed as a Fast Food Worker in a monitored location. The subject is not to be allowed to work for more than eight hours a day and must be kept under surveillance for any signs of strain. The LED gas mask is to be worn at all times during work hours to prevent any potential dangers to the public.

Description: SCP-2999 is a human female with distinctive features including spots on the face and a wide smile. The subject's eyes are orange eyebrow-coloured and the head is witch short. There is a pair of goggles attached to the forehead and a green cross earring on each ear.

In addition, SCP-2999 wears an LED gas mask as an accessory, which appears to be a self-made device. Testing of the mask indicates it to be non-anomalous, though its effectiveness as a protective device is uncertain.

SCP-2999's personality demonstrates a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which occasionally leads to the subject taking on more than they can manage. This often results in amusing situations, such as attempting to carry too many items at once or not completing all their tasks in a single shift.

SCP-2999 has not demonstrated any anomalous properties, but further study is required to ascertain the nature and extent of the subject's abilities. Further measures should be taken to ensure that SCP-2999 does not suffer stress, exhaustion or overexertion, as it could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.
