Item #: SCP-5116

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5116 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with CCTV cameras and audio monitoring devices. The chamber should be furnished with objects that facilitate relaxation and entertainment, such as books, DVDs, and games. SCP-5116's diet should consist of raw meat, and it should receive regular medical check-ups by a designated veterinarian.

SCP-5116 is allowed to work as a News Anchor for a local broadcasting company, but only under strict supervision of Foundation agents disguised as producers. Any news broadcasts involving SCP-5116 must be reviewed and aired only after censorship and modification, in order to avoid exposure of its anomalous properties.

SCP-5116 is not to be exposed to any individual or group who is aware of paranormal phenomena, as it may cause a breach of secrecy and jeopardize the Foundation's mission.

Description: SCP-5116 is a male Tiger, standing at a height of 2.5 meters and weighing approximately 250 kg. Its face features a frightened mouth expression, while wearing normal glasses. The entity's head is adorned with green hair, concealed by a purple cap, and bears a two-color band on its forehead. SCP-5116 also wears a gold earring and frequently carries a lit cigarette as an accessory.

SCP-5116 displays a jovial and outgoing personality, often interacting with its keepers by displaying humorous antics and unexpected dance moves. However, it also has a strong sense of responsibility and duty, as evidenced by its stable employment as a News Anchor.

SCP-5116 possesses anomalous properties, enabling it to communicate telepathically with certain individuals. It is currently unknown how it selects its targets or what triggers the ability, but individuals who have been in close proximity with SCP-5116 have reported hearing its voice in their minds. The entity has not demonstrated any abilities beyond this telepathic link, and there has been no evidence of any threat to personnel or civilians.

Addendum: SCP-5116 has recently displayed an interest in investigating paranormal phenomena, leading to numerous requests to participate in field missions. Due to the inherent risks involved in such operations, all requests have been denied, and SCP-5116 has been advised to focus on its role as a news anchor.
