Subject 1705, also known as the "Monkey Realtor," is a curious case indeed. As a member of the primate family, his appearance is unmistakably simian. However, his choice of accessories and clothing gives him an unpredictable and unsettling demeanor that is not commonly associated with his species.

The frightened expression on his mouth and the normal glasses he wears over his eyes suggest a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty. His jade earring, on the other hand, gives him a touch of eccentricity and individuality that sets him apart from other creatures in the animal kingdom.

The most striking feature of Subject 1705 is, perhaps, his police cap, a symbol of authority and power. This stark contrast between his meek expression and his authoritative headwear creates a sense of unease and distrust in those around him.

But it is his choice of accessories that truly sets him apart. His red scarf, a symbol of warmth and comfort, clashes with the cold, mechanical look of his LED gas mask. This mask is an object of both fascination and fear, as it obscures his face completely and hides any hint of emotion or expression.

Despite his peculiar appearance, Subject 1705 is known to be a logical and analytical real estate agent who approaches his work with a sense of precision and attention to detail. However, his dry sense of humor and occasional quirkiness can make him seem unapproachable and aloof to those around him.

Whether he is a friend or a foe is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Subject 1705 is not to be underestimated or taken lightly. He is a complex and unpredictable creature, whose actions and motives are always shrouded in mystery.
