Item #: SCP-9534

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9534 is to be kept under surveillance at all times and is required to wear their gas mask within the facility. SCP-9534 is allowed to roam freely within Site-██, but is not permitted to exit without the express permission of at least two Level-3 personnel. Any attempts made by SCP-9534 to remove their gas mask are to be reported immediately to security.

Description: SCP-9534 is a human female, standing at approximately 5'9" in height. SCP-9534's face exhibits prominent orange stripes, accompanied by striking red lips, and blue clown-like eyes. SCP-9534 wears a bucket hat on their head, with a two-color band and goggles on their forehead.

SCP-9534 sports a pair of green cross earrings and a choker as an accessory. They also possess a gas mask, which they wear frequently, in conjunction with their police uniform.

SCP-9534 exhibits a strong sense of independence, often resisting authority and rules they view as unnecessary. This has led to instances of rebellious behavior, including sneaking out of the office early and taking unauthorized absences.

SCP-9534's origin and motives are currently unknown.

Addendum: During routine testing of SCP-9534's gas mask, it was discovered that it provides no practical function, leading researchers to believe SCP-9534 may have a psychological attachment to it. Testing for potential anomalous properties is pending approval.
