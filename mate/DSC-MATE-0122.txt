Item #: 122

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 122 is to be given a routine medical checkup and psychological evaluation every 6 months. The subject is to be monitored for any signs of anomalous behavior or disturbance. The subject is allowed to continue his job as a fast food worker without interference as long as no anomalous activity is detected.

Description:

Subject 122 is a human male with spots on his face, and wears nerd glasses. His head is not arranged green. He also wears a normal gas mask as an accessory. The subject has a deep curiosity about the world and is known to spout off obscure facts and trivia to others. This can lead to humorous situations, but also makes him a valuable source of information.

When questioned about his unusual appearance or habits, the subject is cooperative and forthcoming. He is not known to exhibit any kind of hostile or aggressive behavior. In fact, he is quite friendly and personable and is well-liked by his coworkers and customers.

Subject 122 has not exhibited any overtly anomalous behavior, but his fascination with unusual topics and his appearance have marked him as a potential SCP. It is recommended that he be monitored carefully, but for now, he is considered safe.

Addendum:

On ██/██/20██, Subject 122 was observed to have unusual speed and agility when placed in a stressful situation. This behavior is being investigated further.
