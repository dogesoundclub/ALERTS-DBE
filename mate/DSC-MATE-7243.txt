Addendum 7243-1: Interview Transcript 7243-A

Dr. ███████: Good morning, SCP-7243. How are you feeling today?

SCP-7243: Not all right. The world seems to be turning crazier each day, and I feel like a pesky flea caught in the middle of it.

Dr. ███████: I understand your concerns completely. How do you cope with this stress?

SCP-7243: I channel it into my work. I think it's important to keep pushing the truth out there, no matter what happens. Sometimes, even my interests are a helpful distraction. Writing poetry or crafting new costumes gives me a break.

Dr. ███████: That's good to hear. Speaking of your interests, can you tell me more about them?

SCP-7243: I'm an avid collector of rare and unusual objects. I have a thing for strange curiosities, like taxidermy animals or old medical instruments. It's fascinating how much history they hold.

Dr. ███████: That's interesting. Anything else you're particularly passionate about?

SCP-7243: I love crafting intricate costumes inspired by fairy tales or ancient legends. It takes a lot of work, but creating something beautiful from scratch is incredibly rewarding. I also enjoy writing my own poetry inspired by my surroundings, exploring emotions like fear, and confusion.

Dr. ███████: That's all for today, SCP-7243. Thank you for your time.

SCP-7243: Thank you, doctor. Stay alert out there.
