Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-872 is to be housed in a standard dormitory room at Site-██. Access to SCP-872 is to be granted to personnel with Level 2 security clearance or higher. All interactions with SCP-872 must be cleared by at least one supervising researcher.

Description:
SCP-872 is a female human of African descent, aged ██ years old. They are easily distinguishable by several facial features. Most prominently, SCP-872 has multiple spots on their face, which have yet to be explained through any known medical condition. SCP-872 also commonly wears a hooded sweatshirt, and a medical mask which covers their mouth. SCP-872 has noted that this helps them concentrate on their thoughts.

SCP-872 is a doctor at (REDACTED) Hospital, and has shown incredible analytical and logical skills, even among their peers in the medical profession. However, SCP-872 also has a noticeable quirk to their personality. They enjoy making dry, witty observations in a deadpan manner, and have a tendency to tease their friends with subtle humor.

Despite SCP-872's seemingly innocuous demeanor and appearance, there have been reports of unusual events surrounding them. Multiple patients have claimed to feel a "deep connection" with SCP-872, with some even exhibiting improved recovery times.

Addendum:
SCP-872 has been deemed safe for continued observation, but any signs of anomalous activity must be immediately reported to the supervising researcher. Research on the possible effects of SCP-872 on the human body is ongoing.
