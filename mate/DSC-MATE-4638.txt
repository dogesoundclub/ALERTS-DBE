Subject 4638, also known as "The Farmer", is a human male with distinct physical features. His face sports a unique mouth spot, while his eyes resemble a pair of ski goggles. He has a parted pink hairstyle and his ears are adorned with a green cross earring. Notably, he wears a gold chain and a gas mask, not just any gas mask, but an LED-equipped one. 

The Farmer's personality is characterized by their extreme attention to detail, which can manifest as obsessive traits in their daily life. Examples include alphabetizing spices and color-coding clothing. While seemingly innocuous on the surface, this fastidiousness may indicate deeper insidious intentions. 

Monitoring of The Farmer's activities is recommended at all times, as his exact motives are yet to be determined. Any unusual or suspicious behavior should be reported immediately.
