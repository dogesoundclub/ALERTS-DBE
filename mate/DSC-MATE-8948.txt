Description: SCP-8948 is a humanoid entity of the female gender, appearing to be of human origin. SCP-8948 is not to be underestimated, as she possesses immense strength and is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat. SCP-8948 has distinct spots on her face, which contrast with her bright blue clown eyes.

SCP-8948 is a Mafia Boss, once in control of the city of [REDACTED]. Her empire allegedly involved human trafficking and other illicit activities. SCP-8948's criminal operations led to the deaths of several political figures and law enforcement agents.

SCP-8948 is known to wear a black hoodie, silver chain, and normal gas mask as accessories. These are essential for concealing her identity and avoiding detection. The gas mask she wears is modified to filter out any hazardous airborne pathogens, as SCP-8948 has some immunity to viral and bacterial agents.

SCP-8948's personality is complex and often contradictory. On the surface, she seems easy-going and laid-back. However, when it comes to protecting her family or loyal supporters, SCP-8948 is extremely fierce and aggressive. SCP-8948's protective nature once resulted in her engaging in a heated argument with a rival mob boss who insulted her brother.

Addendum: SCP-8948 was apprehended and contained in [REDACTED] after an intense gunfight with the local SWAT team. Several of SCP-8948's associates were killed during the operation. SCP-8948 was subdued with tranquilizers and transported to Site-██ for containment. It is advised that personnel exercise caution while dealing with SCP-8948, as she is volatile and unpredictable.
