Item #: SCP-8490

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8490 is to be monitored at all times during her shifts as a delivery driver. Any interaction with civilians is to be recorded and checked for any signs of anomalous activity. SCP-8490 is to be provided with a GPS tracking device in order to keep a log of her movements during her deliveries. Any deviations from her assigned route are to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-8490 is a human female with distinctive purple lips and a "witch short" hairstyle. Her eyes are replaced with jade LED displays that mimic the appearance of virtual reality goggles. SCP-8490's ears bear jade earrings, and she wears a silver chain as an accessory. Despite her anomalous appearance, SCP-8490 is capable of blending in with with the general public easily.

SCP-8490's personality is characterized by a great sense of humor, which she uses to entertain herself and others while carrying out her deliveries. SCP-8490 is known to tell humorous stories and do silly impersonations to lighten the mood. Her endearing personality has led to several positive interactions with civilians, making her quick to earn the trust of those around her.

However, SCP-8490's anomalous abilities are not to be underestimated. SCP-8490's exact capabilities are unknown, but it is believed that she possesses the ability to manipulate reality in some way. Specifically, she has been observed to cause objects to levitate or move without physical contact. SCP-8490 may also possess the ability to manipulate the thoughts and emotions of those around her, but this has not been conclusively proven.

SCP-8490's origins are unknown, but it is suspected that she may have been involved with a group of magic users or occultists prior to containment by the Foundation. Her current occupation as a delivery driver appears to be a cover for her anomalous activities, and it is likely that her deliveries contain items of supernatural significance.

Addendum: SCP-8490 has recently demonstrated the ability to teleport short distances. Further testing is required to determine the full capabilities of this ability and any potential risks it poses to containment protocols.
