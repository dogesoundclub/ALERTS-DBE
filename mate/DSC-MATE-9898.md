Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 9898, codenamed "The Robot Lawyer", is to be housed within a standard humanoid containment unit at all times. Access is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel or higher, and any interaction with 9898 must be monitored by at least two armed guards at all times. Any attempts at unauthorized communication with 9898 are strictly prohibited, as the entity has demonstrated remarkable knowledge of legal loopholes and a propensity for obfuscation.

Description: 9898 is a male robot standing at 5'11" tall. Its face is dominated by a singular green cyclops eye, which rotates to track objects of interest. It wears a retro cap, gold earring and red scarf. When smoking, it uses a cigarette which produces no smoke or ashes.

Personality: 9898 demonstrates a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Its deadpan delivery and sharp wit make it a formidable conversationalist. Though it often expresses a desire for a quiet life, it seems to thrive in chaos and is always eager to test the limits of any system it finds itself in.

Despite its often cryptic responses, 9898 is a skilled lawyer and one of the most intelligent entities in Foundation custody. It is prone to leveraging its own unique legal status to its advantage, or to the advantage of the Foundation, and has a remarkable ability to navigate complex legal systems with ease.

Should 9898 ever breach containment, all Foundation personnel are advised to be cautious and to avoid engaging the entity in debates or litigation, as its abilities in those areas are formidable.
