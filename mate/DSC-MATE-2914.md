Item #: 2914

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2914 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All interactions with the subject must be approved by Level 2 personnel or higher. Subject 2914 is not to be granted any access to electronic devices unless under controlled circumstances for research purposes only.

Description: Subject 2914 is a human male in his late 20s with blonde hair and noticeable gold earrings. The most distinguishable facial feature is a spot on the subject's mouth, and their eyes are similar to that of ski goggles. Subject 2914 often wears a silver chain, which they seem to hold great value over.

Subject 2914's personality is controlling, with a strong sense of decisiveness that often comes off as highly intimidating to others. It has been noted that subject 2914 is highly efficient in solving complex problems even as a programmer. However, they hold a great disregard for most social norms, often causing conflicts in any project with other members of the team.

Recovery Log: Subject 2914 was discovered through a programmatic audit conducted by Foundation personnel when they inadvertently stumbled upon highly efficient coding on an unknown site. Further investigations led to the discovery of subject 2914's whereabouts and brought into the Foundation's custody.

Additional Notes: Subject 2914 is highly intelligent and could be a valuable asset to class A projects. We strongly recommend limited access to electronic devices and psychological assessment before granting project access. The subject's efficiency in problem-solving should be challenged to reduce the risk of development of narcissistic tendencies.
