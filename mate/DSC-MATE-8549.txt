SCP Identification Number 8549 is a unique specimen in the urban fantasy world, with the distinct appearance of a rabbit. This creature may seem harmless at first glance, but one must beware of its controlling nature. As a Fashion Designer, 8549 enjoys being in control of creative projects, meticulously planning every detail with the efficiency of a well-oiled machine.

The creature's face tells a story of fear; a frightened mouth that seems to be always suspicious of its surroundings. Its eyes are covered with ski goggles, perhaps to shield them from the bright lights of the glamorous world of fashion. The rabbit's head is adorned with green hair tucked neatly into a purple cap, adding a touch of style and attitude.

8549's jade earring suggests a love for accessories and a keen eye for detail, making him perfect for the job. The rabbit's passion for orderliness and detailed-oriented thinking is a double-edged sword; it makes everything run smoothly, but it can also make him come across as an authoritarian in group projects. This results in some humorous situations as our furry friend takes charge of events, delegating tasks with a matter-of-fact attitude.

This SCP is a force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry, but one must always watch their back when interacting with the controlling rabbit.
