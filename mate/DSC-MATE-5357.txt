Description: Subject 5357 is a male rabbit with blue clown eyes, wearing a blue bandana over its head and jade earring on its left ear. It is often seen wearing a red scarf as its accessory. Its personality exhibits a strong sense of humor and enjoys entertaining others. Subject 5357's humor and overall personality often lead to light and jovial situations.

The subject claims to be a real estate agent; its past remains unverifiable with little documentation available. It would often discuss properties or realty propositions, but the staff observed the information to be exaggerated, unrealistic, and occasionally absurd.

Subject 5357 emits an aura of hilarity and mischief, leading to some quirky yet amusing situations. Its jokes, although entertaining, have led to some members of staff exhibiting a sense of loathing or disdain towards it.

Addendum: Requests by Subject 5357 for additional comedy material are to be shelved. Staff who exhibit increasingly negative reactions to its humor and demeanor are encouraged to switch duties to minimize the exposure.
