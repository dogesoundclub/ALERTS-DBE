Item #: 6051

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their high status within the mafia world, subject 6051 cannot be physically contained at this time. All attempts at containment should be through cooperation and negotiation.

Description: Subject 6051, also known as "The Joker," is a female human of unknown age and origin. She is the leader of one of the most powerful mafia families in existence and is known for her sadistic sense of humor. Her physical appearance is highly abnormal, with rainbow-colored hair and a face that appears to be permanently frozen in a wide smile. Her eyes are bright blue with clown-like makeup around them.

Subject 6051 is always seen wearing a silver chain around her neck and a cigarette in her mouth. She also wears jade earrings and a two-color band on her forehead. She enjoys using humor in her interactions with others and is known for her ability to make even the most serious situations seem like a joke. Her sense of humor is so unusual that those who are not familiar with her will often feel uncomfortable or uneasy in her presence.

Despite her often humorous personality, subject 6051 is highly dangerous and should be approached with extreme caution. Her family is responsible for countless acts of violence and destruction, and anyone associated with them risks severe repercussions. 

Addendum: Subject 6051's true motivations remain unknown. Rumors abound as to her endgame, but all attempts at discovery have been met with failure. Until her true goal is unearthed, she remains a threat to society as a whole.
