Description: DSC-MATE-6531 is a male robot designed to appear as a human reporter. It measures 5'11" in height and weighs approximately 200 lbs. DSC-MATE-6531's head is not arranged in the typical humanoid fashion, which includes an elongated neck and protruding mouthpiece. It has two normal glasses for eyes, worn at all times, and a gold earring on its right ear. DSC-MATE-6531's personality is noted for its charisma and ability to connect with others on a deep level.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6531 was discovered in a field outside of a publishing company in New York City, where its appearance caused alarm among the employees due to its lifelike appearance. The Foundation was alerted to its presence by a confidential informant and recovered DSC-MATE-6531 without incident. Further investigation has revealed that DSC-MATE-6531's manufacturers intended for it to be used as a propaganda tool, with the intention of influencing public opinion on a global scale.
