Item #: 7455

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 7455 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██, with a periodic check of its programming to ensure that it remains under control. Access to Item 7455 requires level 2 clearance and a valid reason for access.

Description: Item 7455 is a humanoid robot with a green cyclops eye as its main visual sensor. The robot is male and is programmed to work as a programmer. It is often seen wearing nerdy glasses and a jade earring. It occasionally carries a cigarette in its hand, despite not needing or being able to smoke.

Item 7455’s personality is outgoing and social, often causing it to be the center of attention in most social interactions. Its humor is a defining trait, often causing others around it to burst into uncontrollable laughter at its jokes and humorous anecdotes. This has led to some concerns among containment personnel about the possibility of item 7455 attempting to use its humor to manipulate its human handlers, but no such evidence has been observed to date.

Addendum: Item 7455 has requested permission to participate in social events with Site personnel outside of its regular programming duties. This request has been granted on the condition that it is accompanied by at least two armed guards at all times.
