Item #: 4898

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 4898 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with a heavy-duty locking mechanism, capable of withstanding any force or tampering attempts. Access to the chamber is to be afforded only to personnel above Level 2 clearance.

Description:

Subject 4898 is a human female, appearing to be around 30 years old. She stands at 5'6" and weighs approximately 125 lbs. While her appearance is mostly humanoid, several unique features are present. Her head is blue and appears to be made of metal. Two orange stripes run down each side of her face, starting above each ear and ending at the corners of her mouth. She has bright red clown eyes and red lips, surrounded by small metallic screws. She also has a green cross earring on her left ear and a choker around her neck. Her mouth is always covered with a medical mask.

Subject 4898 is a lawyer by profession, with a reputation for winning tough cases. She is usually laid-back and easy-going but is fiercely loyal to friends and family. Insulting her loved ones will result in her fiercely arguing with the person. At times she can be unpredictable, displaying emotions from one end of the spectrum to another in quick succession.

DSC-MATE-4898 seems to have the ability to modify and destroy metal objects with a touch. This ability is unpredictable and uncontrollable, but has been contained through the use of specialized handcuffs. DSC-MATE-4898's medical mask needs to be worn at all times, as her breath has been known to cause corrosion to metallic surfaces in range.

Addendum:

Subject 4898 was recovered from a law firm in [REDACTED]. They were in turn contacted by an anonymous donor who claimed to possess "an unnatural being." DSC-MATE-4898 was apprehended by the Foundation en route to the facility. There has yet to be any trace of the aforementioned anonymous donor. All persons who had any knowledge of Subject 4898 have been interrogated and administered amnestics.
