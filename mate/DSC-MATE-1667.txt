Description: SCP-1667 is a male human of average height and build. The most notable feature of SCP-1667 is his green layered head. Further examination of the layers has revealed that they are composed of a thick protein substance which appears to be a natural part of SCP-1667's body.

SCP-1667 has gold earrings on both ears, and a silver chain around his neck. These items have been determined to be non-anomalous and do not pose a threat to Foundation security.

Personality-wise, SCP-1667 is predominantly responsible and duty-driven; however, he also possesses a lighthearted and fun-loving character.

SCP-1667's occupation is that of a reporter. It is currently being investigated whether or not his abilities are anomalous in nature.

Addendum: SCP-1667 has requested access to interviews with fellow humanoid SCPs for a report he is writing. All requests must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel.
