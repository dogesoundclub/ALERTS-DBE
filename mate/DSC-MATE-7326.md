DSC-MATE-7326 has shown a strong sense of empathy and is highly attuned to the emotions of others. It displays a friendly and outgoing personality, often engaging in conversation or providing emotional support to those around it.

DSC-MATE-7326 is employed as a fast food worker at a local diner in the town of [REDACTED]. Its main function is to interact with customers and provide friendly and efficient service. However, it has shown a strong interest in human emotions and behavior, often spending its free time observing and analyzing the behavior of others.

DSC-MATE-7326 was initially uncooperative, but eventually agreed to be taken into custody and transported to Site-19 for observation and study. Despite its cooperative nature, caution is advised when interacting with DSC-MATE-7326 due to its unpredictable behavior.
