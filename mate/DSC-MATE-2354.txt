Subject 2354, also known as the "Reckless Farmer," is a peculiar human with notable orange stripes on their face. Their red clown eyes seem to reveal a mischievous personality that often gets them into trouble. The subject's head is adorned with thick brown hair representing the trends of the 90s. A medical mask covers their mouth- possibly a necessity for the farming profession or as a self-protection measure against airborne diseases. Silver chains dangle around their neck, which further adds to their eccentric mystique.

The subject's role as a farmer doesn't seem to match their carefree nature, as indicated in their personality. Their behavior is often impulsive, leading to humorous situations that can border on the precarious. Subject 2354's inability to control their impulses raises suspicion about whether they possess any supernatural traits or are genuinely just a free-spirited farmer. Either way, it would be best to keep a safe distance from them, especially if they're driving a tractor or wielding sharp tools.
