Item #: SCP-6874

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6874 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-17. The subject is to be given access to standard amenities and is permitted to interact with staff only under specific conditions. Any visitors must wear Level 2 Anti-Memetic gear and must not inquire about SCP-6874's facial features or accessories.

Description: SCP-6874 is a female human appearing to be in their mid-twenties with facial spots and a purple lip. Their eyes are VR Jade LED, which emit a soft, pulsating light. SCP-6874's head resembles a pink rabbit, with two floppy ears and a goggle worn on the forehead. The subject also wears a green cross earring and a choker around their neck. When interacting with personnel, SCP-6874 is seen wearing a normal gas mask.

Despite their unusual appearance, SCP-6874 holds the position of theater manager and is proficient in running and maintaining the facility. SCP-6874 is also a fierce protector of their friends and family, and is known to engage in heated arguments with individuals who insult or cause harm to those closest to them. The subject's easy-going demeanor sometimes conflicts with their protective nature but remains a defining trait.

Addendum: SCP-6874 has been observed to have abnormal effects on individuals in their vicinity. Due to its humanoid form, curiosity about SCP-6874's physical features often manifests in interviewers and staff, provoking SCP-6874's defensive tendencies. Once such an incident occurred that resulted in severe injury to a staff member, SCP-6874 was reclassified as Euclid. Further research on the subject's ability to alter emotions and thoughts is ongoing.
