Item #: 1719

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1719 is to be monitored closely while within Foundation facilities. While on duty as a veterinarian, she is to be escorted by at least one Level 2 personnel at all times. All personnel interacting with 1719 must wear infrared glasses to avoid eye contact with her blue clown eyes.

Description: Subject 1719 is a human female standing at 5’4”. She has spots on her skin, which have been diagnosed with vitiligo. She wears a purple cap on her head and has green hair. A pair of goggles are usually worn on her forehead. She also wears a jade earring on the left ear and a choker around her neck.

Personality: Despite her eccentric appearance, Subject 1719 is a highly skilled veterinarian with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. While her jovial personality and tendency to let loose can create humorous situations, her dedication to her profession and willingness to go the extra mile for her patients make her an invaluable asset to the Foundation.

Due to her love for dancing, she can often be found on the dance floor at social events, surprising others with her impressive moves and silly antics. However, her blue clown eyes have been known to have a hypnotic effect on those who make prolonged eye contact with her, leading to uncontrolled laughter and loss of consciousness. 

The Foundation is currently researching ways to mitigate this effect, though they have been unsuccessful so far. As a result, it is of the utmost importance that all personnel interacting with Subject 1719 take the necessary precautions to avoid direct eye contact.
