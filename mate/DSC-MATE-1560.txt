Item #: 1560

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-1560 is to be held in a standard containment chamber which has been converted to accommodate the species' special needs. Access to SCP-1560 is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel or higher, and all interactions with the entity must be supervised. Personnel are reminded that while SCP-1560 may appear harmless, it is still a wild animal and should be treated as such.

Description:

SCP-1560 is a male Tiger of indeterminate age, standing approximately 1.7 m (5'7") tall. The entity appears to be in good health, exhibiting a healthy coat and muscular build. SCP-1560's eyes cannot be seen due to the headset it wears, which is connected to a device emitting a low humming noise. SCP-1560 can communicate verbally in English.

SCP-1560 is covered in various accessories, including a purple cap, jade earring, gold chain, and a whistle. Despite these adornments, SCP-1560 appears to be comfortable wearing them, and it is unknown whether they hold any significance to the entity.

SCP-1560 possesses a unique personality characterized by its keen observation and attention to detail. It has displayed an aptitude for gift-giving, giving presents that suit the personalities of recipients perfectly. However, SCP-1560 may become too fixated on providing the "perfect" gift, spending a considerable amount of time agonizing over the decision. 

Addendum:

SCP-1560's origins are currently unknown, and despite attempts to establish a connection with other instances of its species, SCP-1560 appears to be the only one of its kind. Research is ongoing to determine whether SCP-1560 was the result of anomalous experimentation or a natural occurrence.
