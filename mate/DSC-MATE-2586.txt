Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2586 is to be contained within a rural farmland owned by the Foundation. The area must be fenced and secure, and no human is allowed within its vicinity without permission from the assigned task force. SCP-2586 must be kept isolated from all potential human interaction, either by utilizing deceptive communication, dissuasion or physical restraints in case of emergency.

SCP-2586 must be fed 60 kilograms of raw meat, fruits and vegetables every three days, alternating with two (2) days of fasting to maintain its optimal physical state.

Description: SCP-2586 is a humanoid tiger, standing 6'3" in height and weighing approximately 130 kg. It wears a police officer's hat and a gold chain. Although its eyes are unknown, they appear to have functional sight and an acute sense of smell.

SCP-2586 shows a personality that is primarily composed of empathy, amiability, and playfulness towards others. However, they are prone to mood swings and sudden episodes of aggression, which may pose a risk of harm to the facility’s staff and existence.

Addendum 2586-1: Notes on SCP-2586's Personality

SCP-2586 exhibits an intriguing personality which may have varying effects on its subject, and its behavior must always be monitored. SCP-2586 appears to be highly sociable and humorous, and frequently engages in lighthearted conversations with researchers.

Nonetheless, SCP-2586's often sudden shifts to aggressive and territorial behavior must also be noted. This behavior appears to arise after prolonged isolation and boredom. SCP-2586 must, therefore, be kept busy and entertained with toys or other stimuli, whenever possible.

Addendum 2586-2: Incident Log

On ██/██/████, SCP-2586 became agitated after prolonged isolation and confinement to its containment chamber. It began growling and snarling and eventually broke through the containment wall of its holding cell.

A group of task force agents was immediately deployed to restrain SCP-2586. However, during the ensuing struggle, one member of the task force was injured, and the Foundation incurred a significant cost in repairs to containment infrastructure. 

Conclusion:

Based on the findings of incident 2586, SCP-2586's containment protocols must be revised to include more frequent and varied interactions with other animal entities or human personnel. Additional training for the security personnel designated for SCP-2586 is necessary to ensure the safety of personnel and the facility.
