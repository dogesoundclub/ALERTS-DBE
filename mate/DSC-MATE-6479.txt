Item #: 6479

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6479 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a monkey-sized bed and a variety of toys for enrichment. SCP-6479 is allowed to do his duty as the theater manager with the appropriate safety measures which include, but not limited to: hazmat suits, fake personalities such as using fake names, and staged lighting to appear human if necessary. SCP-6479 is allowed limited access to the internet, but all online activity is monitored.

Description: SCP-6479 is a male monkey, identified as the species "macaca mulatta"  standing at 50 cm in height, weighing 6 kg. SCP-6479 displays human-like features, wearing a pair of nerd glasses and a goggle on his forehead. His ears, consistent with his species, are pointed with a jade earring in his left ear. His speech is limited, mostly consisting of chattering and gesturing, but researchers have noted a basic understanding of English.

SCP-6479's role is as the manager of a small theater in downtown [REDACTED]. He has a laid-back demeanor, but he can become fiercely loyal and protective of his friends and family. SCP-6479 has been known to engage in heated arguments with those who insult his loved ones; consequently escalating into humorous situations.

SCP-6479 was recovered after a local theater-goer reported seeing a monkey running the ticket booth of a theater. Upon investigation by The Foundation, it was confirmed that SCP-6479 was responsible for the theater's activities. It is not known how SCP-6479 developed his managerial skills.

SCP-6479 has shown a remarkable intelligence, organizing events and hiring theater performers with a great deal of efficiency. However, it has been observed that SCP-6479 is highly susceptible to stress, which can lead to erratic and potentially dangerous behavior.

SCP-6479 has expressed a desire to leave the Foundation and return to his theater duties. Further research on the ethical implications of his desires is ongoing.

Addendum: 
Following a request for a birthday party at the theater, SCP-6479 exhibited a level of intelligence not previously observed. The theater performers went missing, and SCP-6479 had set up an intricate trap, which included multiple speakers and flashlights. The performance was well received by the young audience/dignitary group, and the performers were found unharmed in a nearby storage room. SCP-6479 was praised for his creativity and initiative, but the nature of his actions is still a cause for concern.
