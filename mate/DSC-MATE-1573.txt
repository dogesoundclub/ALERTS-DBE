Item #: 1573

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item #1573 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. An armed guard is to be stationed outside the chamber at all times. Access is to be granted to Level 3 personnel and above with explicit permission from the Ethics Committee. 

Description: Item #1573 appears to be a human male with a distinctive mouth spot and a frightened expression. He is often seen wearing a bucket hat with a two-color band, with goggles situated on his forehead. Item #1573 has been observed wearing a jade earring, as well as a silver chain and a candy stick. Information received indicates that Item #1573 is a licensed veterinarian, with a history of personal success within the field. 

However, Item #1573's anomalous properties become apparent upon closer examination. He exhibits an extreme attention to detail, causing him to be obsessively detail-oriented in his everyday life. This can manifest in unexpected ways, such as alphabetizing spice racks, organizing closets by color, and excessive counting. 

Addendum: Item #1573 was initially contained after a domestic dispute in which his level of detail orientation caused harm to a loved one. Further testing is necessary to determine the extent of Item #1573's anomalous properties and their impact on daily functioning. Personnel are advised to approach Item #1573 with caution and to maintain professionalism while under observation.
