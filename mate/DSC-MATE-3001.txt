Item #: SCP-3001

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3001 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with monkey-specific amenities such as ropes, swings, and other items to stimulate its simian nature. All interactions with SCP-3001 must be conducted through a video and audio feed system to prevent the risk of SCP-3001 escaping its chamber.

Description: SCP-3001, also known as "The Monkey Firefighter," is a male monkey standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. SCP-3001's most notable feature is its ski goggle shaped eyes, which give it heightened vision up to two kilometers. SCP-3001 has a frightened mouth and a quirky parted pink head with a gold earring on its right ear. It always carries a candy stick as an accessory.

SCP-3001's personality is friendly and valuing of social connections, but it also has a playful, goofy side that sometimes can lead it into trouble. It has an affinity to tell jokes and engage in playful banter with others, even those not communicating with it. Its desire to make others happy has led to numerous comical situations, and its tendency to insert comedic moments into otherwise grave scenarios has resulted in mixed reactions from other SCP Foundation personnel.

SCP-3001 has been recorded attempting to use its firefighter skills, such as using available materials to create rudimentary fire fighting apparatuses or attempting to put out a flame, but has shown difficulty completing more complex tasks. Nonetheless, its desire to fulfill its role as a firefighter has made it a valuable asset when dealing with fire-related SCPs.

Addendum: SCP-3001 has shown increased interest in observing human behaviors and has tried to mimic some of these actions. The Foundation is currently monitoring SCP-3001 for any potential changes or anomalies in its behavior.
