Item #: SCP-7419

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7419 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to basic amenities. The chamber must be equipped with a television set to ensure SCP-7419's cooperation during scheduled news programs.

Description: SCP-7419 is a male rabbit who works as a news anchor for a local television station. Its appearance is notably distinguishable by two primary characteristics. First, its mouth is always in a frightened expression. Second, its eyes are replaced with VR rainbow LED visuals.

SCP-7419 is often seen wearing a red beanie, gold chain, and smoking a cigarette. Despite its seemingly casual demeanor, SCP-7419 possesses a remarkable ability to observe and attend to the smallest details. Furthermore, it has a tendency to be obsessed with ensuring that it gives the perfect gift, which may result in excessive concerns and time-consuming decision-making.

SCP-7419's abilities in observation and attention to details could be beneficial if directed appropriately, specifically concerning investigative work. However, its preoccupation with gift-giving may be a hindrance during missions. The extent of SCP-7419's anomalous abilities remains unknown and under investigation.

Addendum 7419-1: SCP-7419 has expressed interest in providing fashion advice and regularly requests fashion magazines and clothing catalogs. While not disruptive to containment, staff should not object to SCP-7419's requests to maintain general morale.
