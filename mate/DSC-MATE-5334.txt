Description: SCP-5334 is a male robot designed to resemble a police officer. SCP-5334's body is made of metal, with hydraulic joints, and is covered by a blue uniform. The robot stands at 1.8 meters in height, and weighs approximately 200 kilograms.

SCP-5334's face features a green cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. Its eyes are covered with ski goggles. On his forehead, SCP-5334 wears a set of goggles. It also wears a red beanie on its head, and a medical mask covers its mouth. A silver chain is hanging from its neck, and it has a single gold earring on its right ear.

SCP-5334 is programmed to behave as a police officer. It can communicate verbally and also has the ability to scan and identify individuals on sight. SCP-5334 can access all police databases for its operational needs.

SCP-5334's personality is highly organized and reliable but somewhat stubborn. The robot has difficulties accepting new ideas or changing its routines, which can sometimes lead to humorous situations. Although SCP-5334 is highly logical and efficient, it sometimes lacks social understanding, leading to some erratic behavior around people.

Addendum: SCP-5334 was discovered on a routine police patrol as the officer on duty. SCP-5334 has since been assigned to the Foundation, and all records of its previous service have been purged. Further research into the origins of SCP-5334 is ongoing.
