Item #: 3138

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3138 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment unit in Site-19. Due to SCP-3138's occupation as a police officer, it is allowed to leave containment for scheduled patrols with accompanying security personnel. SCP-3138 is required to wear a headset with a built-in LED and a gold chain at all times. Personnel interacting with SCP-3138 are advised to be cautious and not to provoke SCP-3138.

Description: SCP-3138 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 0.5 meters in height. Its physical appearance is typical of a rabbit, except for its frightened mouth expression. SCP-3138's eyes are unknown as it refuses to remove its headset in the presence of personnel. SCP-3138 frequently displays a deep curiosity about various topics, often spouting off obscure facts and trivia to others. SCP-3138 also has a tendency to become easily frightened and anxious, often requiring reassurance from personnel to calm down.

SCP-3138 displays an anomalous ability to detect criminal activity, being able to sense and track suspects within a 1-kilometer radius. Its ability is thought to be linked to its police officer occupation and has been observed to be more effective in urban environments. SCP-3138 refuses to disclose how it gained this ability.

Addendum: Testing has been conducted to determine the extent of SCP-3138's criminal tracking ability. Results show that SCP-3138's ability is above average compared to regular police officers. SCP-3138's ability does not work on criminals that have no criminal record, cannot track down suspects that are actively evading capture and can be disrupted by SCPs that possess a cloaking ability.
