Item #: 9703

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9703 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to a natural environment in order to ensure proper care and nourishment. Access is granted to the enclosure only with Level 3 clearance, and any interaction or testing with SCP-9703 must be supervised by no fewer than two (2) trained personnel at all times. SCP-9703 is to be provided with emotional support and counseling on a bi-weekly basis to prevent emotional and psychological disturbances.

Description: SCP-9703 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis with a frightened mouth, normal glasses, a not arranged green head, a gold chain, and a candy stick as its accessories. While SCP-9703 possesses no anomalous physical properties, it has demonstrated a unique emotional connection and empathy towards others, especially towards those experiencing physical or emotional pain. SCP-9703's emotional capacity seems to be heightened, and has been observed to cry or display emotional outbursts in response to events that might not trigger any such response in human beings.

SCP-9703 is incredibly fond of animals and nature, and has been observed to closely examine and interact with plants and animal species present in its containment chamber. SCP-9703 shows an aversion to any form of aggression or violence and can become distressed or agitated in such situations.

Addendum: SCP-9703's primary duty within the Foundation is that of a doctor, where its emotional and empathetic nature has been found to be incredibly useful in treating distressed or traumatized individuals. SCP-9703 has shown a high degree of competence in aiding human researchers in treating and diagnosing cases that require both medical and emotional support. SCP-9703's presence has been shown to have a calming effect on several other SCPs during experimentation procedures, further highlighting its therapeutic value.

SCP-9703 was discovered following reports of a monkey with unusual emotional behaviors following an incident in ████████ ████████. The Foundation intervened and assumed custody of SCP-9703, recognizing its unique emotional abilities and the potential it held for aiding research in related fields.
