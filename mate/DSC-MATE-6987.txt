SCP-6987 tends to enjoy debating and arguing with others, often over trivial or unimportant topics. Her logical mind and sharp tongue make her a formidable opponent in any argument. However, her humorous and witty comments can often be disarming, taking opponents off guard and allowing her to win the argument.

Overall, SCP-6987 is an enigmatic figure, with a unique sense of style and a quick wit that has been known to leave those around her scratching their heads in confusion. While her personality may be polarizing, there is no denying that she is one of the most interesting characters in the urban fantasy world.
