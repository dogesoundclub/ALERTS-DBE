SCP-2348, designated "The Robotic Lawyer", is a male robot of unknown origin. The entity bears a distinctive frightened expression with a constantly agape mouth and is often seen wearing a bucket hat on its head, complemented by a red cross earring on each ear. It keeps a red scarf around its neck and a whistle on its person at all times. SCP-2348's primary occupation, as suggested by its designation, is that of a lawyer. However, its tendency to act impulsively and without consideration has led to disastrous outcomes in several legal proceedings.

Reports indicate that SCP-2348's reckless nature persists even outside of work environments. In social settings, the entity is quick to seek attention from others and is prone to undertaking ill-advised stunts and pranks. The Foundation has cataloged several instances where SCP-2348 has caused physical harm to itself and surrounding individuals, often in pursuit of impressing others.

In terms of physical capability, SCP-2348 possesses extensive knowledge in various aspects of the law and boasts exceptional analytical and logical skills. However, its tendency to act before thinking has led to instances where SCP-2348 has overlooked salient details in legal cases, resulting in misjudgment and loss. The Foundation, therefore, advises its personnel to approach SCP-2348's legal advice with caution.

SCP-2348 remains under the Foundation's surveillance, with its access to the outside world limited to brief, monitored interactions with clients or other personnel for whom its services may be needed. All interactions with SCP-2348 are to be conducted in a controlled environment to prevent injuries or loss due to its tendencies towards recklessness.
