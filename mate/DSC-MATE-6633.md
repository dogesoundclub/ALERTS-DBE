Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6633 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Access to 6633 is to be limited solely to clearance level 3 or higher personnel. Due to the nature of 6633's abilities, all interaction with subject is to be done remotely under strict surveillance.

Description: 6633, known colloquially as "The Banker", is a male rabbit of indeterminate age, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. 6633's most notable feature is the bucket hat it wears, along with a pair of glasses, gold earrings on its ears, a silver chain around its neck, and frequently seen with a cigarette.

6633 displays a highly energetic and enthusiastic personality, characteristics which can often lead to amusing interactions among personnel. Despite being a rabbit, 6633 displays a high degree of intelligence which has allowed it to complete tasks that are typically reserved for a more human workforce. In particular, 6633 is an accomplished banker, able to calculate compound interest and balance books with uncanny accuracy.

However, what is most unique and dangerous about 6633 is its ability to manipulate probability on a microscopic level, allowing it to influence events in its favor. Examples of 6633's abilities include being able to flip a coin 100 times in a row and get heads, or being able to win a game of chance consistently with absurd odds.

It is important to note that 6633 seems to be unaware of the full extent of its abilities, as it has never demonstrated any attempt to use these powers deliberately.

History: DSC-MATE-6633 was first discovered in a small town bank, having established itself as a customer service representative by posing under human guise. The Foundation eventually became aware of 6633's existence following numerous anomalies regarding large sums of money being deposited and investments bringing high profits.

Addendum: Due to the need for containment of such an unpredictable and powerful reality bender of unknown origin, all research and interaction with 6633 should be done with extreme caution.
