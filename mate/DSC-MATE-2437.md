His most notable feature is his infectious smile, which can often be seen even when he's not in the best of moods. DSC-MATE-2437 wears normal glasses and his head is typically covered by a hoodie. A 2-color band is visible on his forehead, and he is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick.

DSC-MATE-2437's personality is his most notable characteristic, as he possesses a high level of charisma and has an uncanny ability to connect with others on a deep level.

DSC-MATE-2437 is employed as a mechanic and has the ability to repair and manipulate machinery with ease. At present, there is no indication that DSC-MATE-2437's anomalous properties extend to this ability, but further testing is required to confirm this.

However, extreme caution must be exercised when interacting with DSC-MATE-2437, as his persuasive abilities have the potential to be used against the Foundation's interests.
