Item #: SCP-7036

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7036 is to be kept under constant surveilance and is to be provided with a stable work environment in the theater designated for her use. Personnel are advised not to approach SCP-7036 when she exhibits signs of distress or exhaustion, as this may lead to complications in containment.

Description: SCP-7036 is a humanoid entity bearing the appearance of a middle-aged woman with distinctive spotted skin. Her eyes are unnaturally colored in blue and the subject wears a bucket hat atop of her head, with a red cross earring adorning each ear.

SCP-7036 is an empathetic and compassionate individual, exhibiting a strong desire to help those around her. However, her tendencies to take on other people's problems as her own can be both noble and potentially dangerous. This can result in excessive fatigue and exhaustion for the subject, leaving her vulnerable to external influences.

Theater management has reported numerous occasions of SCP-7036 exhibiting anomalous behavior, including sudden changes in lighting, sound and temperature without apparent cause. It has been suggested that these incidents are related to SCP-7036's emotional state and can be ameliorated through counseling and other support programs.

Addendum: SCP-7036 has displayed an affinity for silver chains, which appear to soothe her when worn. These items have been added to her approved wardrobe list and are to be provided as needed. SCP-7036 is also permitted to engage in meditation and other spiritual practices to aid in her containment.
