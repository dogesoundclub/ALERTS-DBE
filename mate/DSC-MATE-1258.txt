Item #: SCP-1258

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1258 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with minimal amenities. Personnel must wear protective ear and eye gear when interacting with SCP-1258 to avoid accidental activation of anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-1258 appears to be an average human male in his mid-twenties with a unique set of physical features. His mouth is marked with a distinctive spot, and his eyes emit a bright jade LED. SCP-1258's hair is wild and unkempt, and his ears show a green cross earring. His head appears to be a shade of green, with no evidence of hairstyling or grooming. 

SCP-1258 is known to wear a medical mask as a piece of personal attire in public. He also wears a gold chain as an accessory around his neck. These features, combined with his spontaneous and risk-taking behavior, make SCP-1258 stand out in a crowd. 

SCP-1258 possesses an anomalous property that causes individuals who make eye contact with him to experience sudden feelings of impulsiveness and a desire to take risks. This effect is believed to be related to SCP-1258's unique LED eyes. 

Despite his anomalous property, SCP-1258 has been known to work as a police officer in his civilian life. His spontaneous nature and love of risk-taking have sometimes led to humorous situations like jumping off cliffs into water bodies. SCP-1258 maintains a happy-go-lucky attitude that seems to be infectious to those around him.

Addendum: SCP-1258 is now off-duty and living a peaceful life. New containment procedures are in place and working well.
