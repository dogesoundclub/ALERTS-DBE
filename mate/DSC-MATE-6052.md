Item #: 6052

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6052, also known as the "Banker Monkey," is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. The chamber is to be furnished with standard amenities, including a bed, toilet, and writing desk.

Subject 6052 is to be provided with a variety of newspapers, books, and financial reports to keep him occupied during his stay. He is to be given a red scarf and a whistle, as these items have been observed to calm him down during periods of distress.

Description: Subject 6052 is a male monkey of the species Cercopithecus, standing at 1.1 meters in height and weighing approximately 22 kilograms. He possesses a frightened mouth, seemingly always on the brink of tears, and his eyes are adorned with normal glasses. He wears a gold earring on his left ear.

Subject 6052's primary profession is that of a banker, likely due to his remarkable ability to calculate and organize finances. He is, however, unable to speak any human language fluently, and relies on sign language to communicate.

While compassionate and empathetic, Subject 6052 is prone to taking on the problems of others as his own, leading to potential exhaustion and burnout. He has been observed to suffer from stress-induced seizures and anxiety attacks when pushed too far, hence the need for his red scarf and whistle.

Addendum: Subject 6052 was discovered in the basement of a bank in downtown ██████████, having apparently been abandoned by a group of animal smugglers. The bank's employees had developed a fondness for him due to his helpful nature and impressive financial skills, leading to his eventual containment by the Foundation.
