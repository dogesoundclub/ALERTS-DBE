Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1591 is to be contained in a secure cell at all times. Any communication with SCP-1591 must be conducted through a secure digital interface to avoid any possible mind-altering effects. During any communication, SCP-1591 must be referred to as "Boss."

SCP-1591 is the current leader of a Mafia family operating within [REDACTED]. Foundation agents are to monitor their every move to prevent any possible breach of secrecy. In the event of any breach, all personnel must follow the protocols for a Class-A amnesticization.

Description: SCP-1591 is a male human with a unique facial feature - a spot on their mouth that resembles a lipstick mark. Their mouth often appears frightened, which can be attributed to their history of violent crime and ongoing conflicts with other Mafia families.

SCP-1591's eyes are fitted with advanced virtual reality LED displays, which allow them to communicate with their many associates and players in the shadowy underworld. Their head is always fitted with a high-end headset, similarly equipped with LED displays.

SCP-1591's obsession with giving the "perfect" gift has been noted by Foundation personnel, leading to the suspicion of anomalous abilities. However, no conclusive evidence has been found to support this theory.

Accesorry #1: SCP-1591 is never seen without their trademark gold chain, which is rumored to contain a hidden compartment for smuggling valuable items.

Accesorry #2: During meetings with rival Mafia members or Foundation personnel, SCP-1591 wears a custom-made LED gas mask that obscures their face, making them difficult to identify.

Personality: SCP-1591 is a man of detail, always attentive and observant to every situation. This trait has allowed them to move through the Mafia ranks with remarkable ease. However, SCP-1591's obsession with perfection may also act as a flaw, as they can spend countless hours agonizing over the tiniest details of every decision.

SCP-1591 is known to have a vast network of informants, spies, and hitmen, making them a formidable enemy to cross. In conclusion, SCP-1591 is a dangerous individual with significant influence in the Mafia underworld, and special precautions must be taken to contain their power.
