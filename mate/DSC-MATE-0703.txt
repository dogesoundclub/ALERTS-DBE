Item #: SCP-703

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-703 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No personnel are allowed to make physical contact with SCP-703 without the explicit permission of at least two Level 3 personnel. All requests made by SCP-703 must be screened and approved by at least one Level 4 personnel before being carried out. Any attempts at direct communication with SCP-703 must be made with extreme caution.

Description: SCP-703 is a male human, roughly 27 years of age, with the distinctive orange stripes on his face being its most notable feature.  Although this trait is not directly related to SCP-703's anomalous properties, it serves as an identifier for the entity. SCP-703 also possesses blue clown eyes and is often seen wearing a green cross earring and a gold chain. SCP-703 also frequently smokes cigarettes.

SCP-703 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which it carries out in its role as an electrician. However, it also possesses a charismatic personality and often engages in humorous situations, such as singing and dancing along to its favorite songs. SCP-703 also exhibits a strong connection to its police cap and red victory band, often referring to them as if they have sentimental value.

SCP-703's anomalous properties are not fully understood, but it appears to possess some ability to influence the emotions and behavior of those it comes into contact with. This is often seen in the way that SCP-703 is able to spread positivity and humor among those around it. However, it is unclear if SCP-703's behavior is a direct result of its abilities or simply a manifestation of its own personality.

Addendum: Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-703. Its ability to influence emotions should not be underestimated, and its intentions and motivations remain unclear. Any suspicious behavior or requests made by SCP-703 should be reported to Site-██ immediately.
