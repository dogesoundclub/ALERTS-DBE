Item #: 5727

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5727 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times when not actively in use for broadcasting purposes. Access to 5727 is restricted to authorized personnel only. Any attempts to modify, hack or alter 5727's programming must be reported to the related department immediately.

Description: 5727 is a male news anchor robot with a green cyclops eye as its main feature, and has been observed to wear normal glasses to appear more approachable. Its head is arranged in a non-humanoid fashion and it boasts a gold earring in its ear. The robot is also frequently seen with a red scarf and a whistle.

5727's personality may appear scatterbrained at times having a tendency to forget pertinent information and may fall prey to cognitive glitches, though these slips have only happened during moments of extreme stress. It's worth noting that for all of its quirks, 5727 has otherwise behaved within expected parameters while performing broadcasting duties.

Addendum: Though there is no concrete evidence of malfeasance, 5727 has proven itself to be a bad-luck charm with seemingly inevitable events that occur during broadcasts. Efforts to discern if 5727 is a physical or cognitive source of these anomalous occurrences are currently being discussed by the applicable department.
