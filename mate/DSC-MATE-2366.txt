Item #: SCP-2366

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2366 is to be kept under standard humanoid containment procedures. Regular psychological evaluations are to be conducted to monitor SCP-2366's mental state.

Description: SCP-2366 is a human male identified as an electrician. The subject stands at 183 cm tall and weighs 70 kg. SCP-2366 bears a distinctive mouth spot on the left corner of his mouth, which appears to be a birthmark. SCP-2366 is also distinguishable by his jade LED-embedded virtual reality eyes, his doge hat on top of his head, and his jade earring. SCP-2366 is commonly seen sporting a gold chain and a normal gas mask.

SCP-2366 has a strong sense of independence and autonomy. SCP-2366 tends to avoid asking for any form of assistance, even when necessary. This characteristic has created several amusing situations; for instance, SCP-2366 stubbornly refuses to use a map when lost, or he tries to carry a heavy object alone.

Addendum: SCP-2366 has exhibited signs of hybridization with anomalous creatures in the past, leading to fears of unpredictable side effects. However, no significant changes have been noted to date. Monitoring will continue as deemed necessary.
