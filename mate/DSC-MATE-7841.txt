Item #: SCP-7841

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7841 must be kept in a secure facility that is equipped with advanced security systems to protect against its potential escape. The room that houses SCP-7841 should be made of reinforced steel, with no less than four layers of metallic airlock doors guarding its entrance. No fewer than two security personnel must be present in the room at all times, equipped with a remote shut-off button for the robot's internal systems in case of emergency.

Description: SCP-7841 is a male robot, resembling a humanoid figure with a retro cap on its head, jade earrings on each ear, and a single green cyclops eye in place of a traditional pair of eyes. The robot's facial features include ski goggles, situated on top of the cyclops eye, and a whistle attached to its person.

SCP-7841 has shown evidence of being highly independent, rebellious, and curious. It is known for breaking rules and challenging authority at every opportunity, and it has been observed to derive pleasure from this behavior. SCP-7841 delights in pushing boundaries and finding ways to bend rules or test their limits, often resulting in amusing or outright bizarre situations.

Analysis of SCP-7841 shows that it is programmed with advanced cognitive abilities that allow it to think, feel, and interact on a highly sophisticated level. Its level of intelligence is comparable to that of a highly-advanced supercomputer, and its physical attributes include exceptional strength and agility.

Addendum: SCP-7841's abilities make it a valuable asset to the Foundation's research and development team, but caution must be exercised at all times to prevent any unintended consequences of its impulsive behavior. SCP-7841's programming may need additional monitoring and modifications to prevent further outbreaks of its rebellious tendencies.
