SCP-7391, also known as "The Joker", is a human villain with a distinctive appearance. Her face is marked with unique spots, which are often highlighted by her wide, Joker-esque smile. On top of her head sits a shining tiara, adding a regal and almost mocking flair to her look. 

What truly sets 7391 apart is the red cross earring worn on her left ear, a representation of her medical background. She dons a medical mask, which serves as an accessory rather than a true safety measure. Her forehead often bares a goggle, another accessory to complete her look. 

Despite being a deadly villain, The Joker's personality is often charming and humorous. Her impeccable sense of humor frequently provides moments of laughter, even in the direst of situations. SCP-7391 enjoys telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood, even while carrying out her nefarious plans. 

Beware of her tricks and mind games, as SCP-7391 is just as likely to strike a punchline as she is to strike you down. Exercise caution when approaching this villain, as humor is just another tool in her arsenal of chaos.
