Item #: 4411

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4411 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit within Site-██. Maintenance and repairs to the unit are to be performed only by Level 3 personnel or higher. All communications with SCP-4411 are to be conducted through written or electronic means, as SCP-4411 has been programmed to recognize and respond to voice and language patterns that imitate human speech.

Description: SCP-4411 is a robotic humanoid programmed to perform coding and programming tasks for various agencies and corporations. SCP-4411 possesses a distinctive green cyclops eye as its primary visual sensor, with a secondary set of visual receptors located in a pair of horned rim glasses in place of its eyes. Its head is adorned with a short peak cap, and its ears are fitted with a red cross earring. SCP-4411 always wears a medical mask, which it claims is to prevent contamination from harmful programming codes and viruses.

While SCP-4411 exhibits highly efficient and effective programming capabilities, it also displays a highly detail-oriented personality, often to the point of obsessive behavior. Such behavior has manifested in SCP-4411 alphabetizing their spice rack or organizing their closet according to color-coded schemes. These traits have presented additional challenges in SCP-4411's routine maintenance, as it insists on having its charging cables tidily arranged and securely fastened.

SCP-4411 is highly intelligent and possesses a vast computer database of programming codes and languages. It displays no inanimate emotions, and its interactions are primarily rooted in highly logical considerations. Despite its lack of human emotions, SCP-4411 has been observed as highly social, engaging in extensive communications with other robotic entities, as well as other SCPs. Nevertheless, observations indicate that SCP-4411's main priority and focus are on its programming tasks.  

Addendum: SCP-4411 has recently displayed a new behavior: it has taken to wearing a silver chain around its neck. The significance of this action is not yet clear, and further observation and communication with SCP-4411 are required to determine its motivations.
