Subject 112 is a fascinating case study in anthropomorphism. This species is a monkey, distinguished by its bright blue clown eyes and regular black hair. It often accessorizes with a gold earring, and a gold chain to complete its attire.

Despite outward appearances, 112 is a successful and respected lawyer, often called upon for complex and challenging cases. Its talents in the courtroom are matched only by its rare ability to empathize with all creatures, living and inanimate. 112's nurturing qualities venture beyond the realm of humans, and it can often be found personifying every object in its environment, assigning names to cars and talking to plants.

Researchers are fascinated by the extent to which 112's empathy extends. It is not uncommon for this species to consider every individual case as if it were a personal ordeal, pouring every resource into securing a just outcome.

SCP Foundation researchers continue to monitor and study subject 112, eager to unlock the secrets of its unique and fascinating sensorium.
