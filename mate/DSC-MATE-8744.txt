Item #: 8744

Classification: Monkey Farmer

Gender: Male

Physical Description: Subject 8744 appears as a rather unremarkable monkey, save for a few particular details. The subject's head is adorned with a vibrant purple cap that sports a headset over one ear, presumably for communication purposes. A gold earring dangles from the monkey's left ear, further adding to the subject's eccentric appearance. Additionally, 8744 has been seen sporting a silver chain around its neck and a whistle in one of its hands.

Personality: Subject 8744 is a rather brash and daring individual, often making spontaneous decisions that can lead to humorous mishaps. Despite this recklessness, the monkey farmer displays a certain sense of confidence and charm that seems to endear him to others. It is unknown whether the apparent need for attention and admiration is a natural occurrence or a result of SCP-8744's exposure to the supernatural.

Containment Procedures: Due to the lack of evidence of paranormal abilities or threats in SCP-8744, he is allowed to live freely within the local community with certain ethical monitoring. However, should 8744 begin to exhibit any concerning behavior, he is to be transported to Site-17 for further study.

Observation Log: SCP-8744 is currently living his life as a local farmer in a small community in the outskirts of a major city. Despite his odd appearance, the subject has managed to integrate himself into the local society, known for his daring and humorous antics. People seem to be drawn to the monkey farmer, flocking to his farm to purchase goods from him or simply to take pictures with 8744.

Addendum: As of incident [REDACTED], SCP-8744 has been moved to Site-17 for closer observation due to an increase in erratic and troubling behavior. Further experimentation and testing are required to determine the extent of SCP-8744's anomalous abilities.
