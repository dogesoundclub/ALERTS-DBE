Description: DSC-MATE-7975 is a human male, aged 45 years, standing at 6 feet tall. The subject wears a bucket hat on his head and normal glasses with a green cross earring on both ears. The subject also wears a two-color band on his forehead and a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-7975's most distinguishing characteristic is its dry sense of humor. Despite its introverted nature, the subject often surprises those around it with quick-witted and deadpan jokes. These jokes have been known to catch subjects off guard and generate a surprising amount of laughter.

DSC-MATE-7975's humor appears to be its primary defense mechanism, as it is slow to trust those around it. However, once trust is established, the subject is known to be an asset in social situations.

Addendum: There have been reported incidents of DSC-MATE-7975 using its humor to diffuse tense situations between other DSCs, suggesting that its humor may play a more significant role in the containment of other anomalies. Further research is ongoing.
