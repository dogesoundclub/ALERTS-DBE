Subject 2721, also known as "The Don", is a towering figure within the criminal underworld. As the top dog of a powerful mafia syndicate, it is said that he has single-handedly orchestrated some of the largest organized crime operations in recent history. 

Despite his cutthroat reputation, The Don's appearance is somewhat unassuming. He has a smattering of spots across his face, and his large, round eyes are often concealed behind a pair of nondescript glasses. But it's his hair that truly sets him apart - a wild and unkempt green that often looks as if it hasn't seen a brush in weeks. 

The Don's voice is rarely heard, as he prefers to communicate through his network of underlings. When he does speak, however, it's always muffled behind a medical mask that he wears as a precaution against the germ-riddled city. It's rumored that his own immune system is incredibly weak, and that he must take extraordinary measures to avoid illness. 

Surprisingly, The Don is far from an emotionless businessman. In fact, he's quite sensitive to the feelings of those around him. He has been known to console grieving widows, provide financial aid to struggling families, and even broker peace between rival gangs. His silver chain, a symbol of his power and wealth, is a reminder that he is not to be trifled with. 

For those who know The Don well, it's said that he has a wicked sense of humor. He delights in making others laugh, even during times of stress or danger. It's almost as if he sees the absurdity of his own situation, and revels in the irony of it all. 

Subject 2721 is not to be underestimated. His mind is sharp, his influence vast, and his heart anything but cold.
