Item #: 291

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of DSC-MATE-291, it has been placed under constant surveillance by Foundation personnel. Any tampering with DSC-MATE-291 is strictly prohibited, and any unauthorized activity around DSC-MATE-291 is to be met with immediate containment measures.

Description: DSC-MATE-291 is a robotic politician of undetermined origin. DSC-MATE-291 stands at a height of approximately 1.8 meters and has a humanoid body. The appearance of DSC-MATE-291 is unusual, with its head topped with a Doge hat, ski goggles adorned for eyes, and a medical mask serving as a mouth. Additionally, DSC-MATE-291 sports a Gold chain and a Red Cross Earring.

DSC-MATE-291's natural talent for leadership is evident in its personality. It often takes charge in social and work environments, displaying remarkable confidence and assertiveness. However, DSC-MATE-291's robotic nature means that it lacks emotional depth, and its communication with humans is purely calculated and calculated to meet their objectives.

DSC-MATE-291 is a highly sophisticated robot, possessing advanced computing and data processing abilities. These abilities are often used to carry out political and diplomatic negotiations, with DSC-MATE-291 displaying a remarkable ability to analyze data and predict future outcomes accurately.

Despite DSC-MATE-291's impressive abilities, there is concern among the Foundation's senior personnel regarding its true objective. The possibility that DSC-MATE-291 could be used as an instrument of political power and influence is frightening. It is for this reason that DSC-MATE-291 is classified as a Euclid object with constant surveillance and restricted access to high-level personnel only.

Further research is ongoing, and Foundation scientists have been tasked with analyzing DSC-MATE-291's operational code and identifying any hidden objectives or potential security breaches. Until such time as these objectives are identified, DSC-MATE-291 remains under constant watch by the Foundation's senior security personnel.
