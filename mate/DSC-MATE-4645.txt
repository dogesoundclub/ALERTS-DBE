Item #: SCP-4645

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4645 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel interacting with SCP-4645 must wear MTF-approved clown-resistant gear, and all interactions must be recorded for analysis. SCP-4645 is permitted to continue their employment as a traffic officer provided that they are supervised and do not deviate from their duties.

Description: SCP-4645 appears as a male human with numerous spots covering their face, and red clown eyes. Their hair is parted pink and they often wear a silver chain and candy stick as accessories. SCP-4645's personality is best described as having a strong sense of duty and responsibility, while also possessing an ability to create a sense of joy and levity in their environment.

SCP-4645's anomalous properties manifest primarily in their ability to influence the emotional states of humans in their vicinity. SCP-4645's presence can cause individuals to experience a positive emotional state, which can manifest as feelings of joy, happiness, and contentment. In certain situations, SCP-4645 has been observed to escalate these emotions to a point that may lead to dangerous levels of euphoria and disorientation.

SCP-4645's abilities have been noted to affect traffic flow, with people becoming increasingly more reckless and erratic in their driving behaviors in SCP-4645's vicinity. Additionally, SCP-4645 has exhibited enhanced physical abilities that surpass those of normal humans, including increased agility and strength.

SCP-4645 has displayed a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel and has repeatedly shown a desire to uphold their duties as a traffic officer. Despite this, SCP-4645's anomalous effects make it necessary for the Foundation to closely monitor and regulate their interactions with others.

Addendum: SCP-4645 has shown a strong affinity for music and frequently incorporates it into their interactions with others. This has the potential for creating new avenues of research into SCP-4645's abilities and limitations.
