Item #: 5676

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of the subject's profession and resources, it is currently impossible to contain Item #5676. Any interaction with the subject must be approached with utmost caution and all personnel must be authorized by at least Level 3 clearance. The subject is believed to have ties with numerous criminal organizations, and as such, monitoring and surveillance must be maintained at all times.

Description: Item #5676 appears to be a human male with a distinctive mohawk hairstyle and normal glasses. The subject is often seen sporting a jade earring on one of his ears. Despite his seemingly intimidating appearance, the subject exhibits an unusual personality trait that sets him apart from typical mafia bosses. He is known to be highly caring and nurturing, often extending it towards inanimate objects such as his car or household appliances. This has led many to speculate that the subject may possess some level of anomalous ability, although no evidence of such has been recorded.

Personality: The subject has been observed to show genuine concern for those under his protection, be it people or objects. He may often give his car a unique name, talk to his plants, or even anthropomorphize his household appliances. It is unclear whether this behavior stems from emotional attachment or some deeper psychological issue.

The subject's criminal activities are a constant threat to public safety, but his unconventional personality has garnered him a certain degree of respect within the criminal underworld. It is important to remember that despite his peculiarities, Item #5676 is still a dangerous individual and should be treated with extreme caution.

Additional Notes: The exact extent of the subject's anomalous abilities, if any, is currently unknown. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether or not he poses a greater threat to society than originally thought. Until such time, all attempts to bring him into containment should be considered high risk.
