SCP-3266, also known as "The Orange Striped Car Salesman", is a humanoid male of the human species. His face bears orange stripes that run along his cheeks, contrasting starkly with his otherwise normal complexion. He is known for his wide, infectious smile that seems to light up every room he enters. His eyes are unique, sporting VR Rainbow LED technology that mimics a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns.

SCP-3266's head is shaved bald, with the distinctive addition of a monk-shaped tattoo on the back of his skull. He wears a jade earring in his right ear, and a medical mask covers his mouth, ostensibly to protect against diseases. The salesman accessorizes with a red scarf, wrapped tightly around his neck.

In terms of personality, SCP-3266 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility that compels him to take on more than he can handle at times. This can lead to humorous situations, such as him trying to carry too many things at once, or trying to fit all his daily tasks into a single day. However, his commitment to his job as a car salesman and the satisfaction of his customers is unwavering. SCP-3266 is a force to be reckoned with in the world of car sales, charming and persuading even the most reluctant of buyers into purchasing their dream car. Approach with caution, as his skills are not to be underestimated.
