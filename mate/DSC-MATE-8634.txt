Item #: SCP-8634

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8634 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to appropriate food, water, and hygiene facilities. It is to be provided with a gas mask at all times as a precautionary measure. All interactions are to be conducted by Level 2 personnel or higher and only with the use of sign language or other non-verbal communication methods.

Description: SCP-8634 appears as a male monkey species with normal glasses and a doge hat on its head. It has a unique 2 color band on its forehead and wears a gold earring in each ear as well as a silver chain around its neck. In addition, SCP-8634 carries a metal gas mask as a precautionary measure.

SCP-8634 is a former firefighter possessing both intelligence and problem-solving abilities that rival human counterparts. It displays a laid-back and easy-going personality, but can become fiercely loyal and protective of its loved ones. SCP-8634 has been observed engaging in heated arguments with individuals who insulted its family or friends, often resulting in humorous situations.

SCP-8634's most distinctive feature is its ability to transform into any variety of primate species, including gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. This transformation is instantaneous and seamless, and there appears to be no limit to the number of times it can change. SCP-8634 shows no signs of age, and it is unclear if it has a biological lifespan.

Addendum: SCP-8634 was discovered by Foundation personnel when it was observed in the act of protecting a group of primates from a wildfire in a California forest. SCP-8634 came to the attention of the Foundation when it transformed into an entirely different primate species to rescue a researcher who was lost in the forest. SCP-8634 was successfully captured and brought to Foundation containment without incident.
