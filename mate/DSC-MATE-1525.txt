Item #: 1525

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1525 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell, with regular mental health evaluations to ensure stable behavior. Any objects or personal items brought into SCP-1525's cell must be inspected and approved by a designated staff member.

Description: SCP-1525 appears to be a human female of indeterminate age, with a distinctive appearance. The subject has spotted skin and a perpetual smile on her face. SCP-1525's eyes are replaced by a pair of visually impressive VR Rainbow LED displays. The subject is often seen wearing a bucket hat and gold earrings. SCP-1525 also habitually wears a choker and can be seen smoking cigarettes in stressful situations.

SCP-1525 is a reporter with a caring personality that extends beyond living beings to inanimate objects as well. SCP-1525 names her car and talks to her plants, and this behavior has extended to household appliances. SCP-1525 has been observed to anthropomorphize objects, attributing behavior and emotions to them.

SCP-1525 appears to have developed a connection with its personal objects, and any attempt to remove objects from her results in a significant emotional response leading to what can be interpreted as anxiety and panic attacks.

Addendum: SCP-1525 was initially contained due to anomalous qualities not yet understood by the SCP Foundation. These qualities are under review, and testing is currently underway. Further observations and studies are required to fully comprehend and understand the nature of SCP-1525's anomalous nature.
