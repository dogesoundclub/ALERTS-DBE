Description:

Item #: SCP-3946
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3946 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-3946 is not to be allowed contact with any other SCPs without explicit approval from at least two Level-3 personnel.

SCP-3946 is to be monitored 24/7 for any signs of abnormal behavior or activity. Any changes in SCP-3946's behavior are to be immediately reported to the on-site supervisor.

Description: SCP-3946 is a rabbit humanoid, standing at 165cm in height. SCP-3946 identifies as male and typically wears a blue hoodie. SCP-3946 has blue "clown" eyes and a frightened mouth. SCP-3946 is often seen with a cigarette.

SCP-3946 touts a very outgoing and sociable personality. SCP-3946 enjoys being the center of attention and is known to tell jokes and stories that can be humorous, causing widespread laughter. SCP-3946 is known to be terrified of enclosed spaces, and any prolonged confinement is known to cause severe anxiety and panic attacks, leading to self-destructive behavior.

SCP-3946's anomalous effects manifest when SCP-3946 enters a train cockpit. Once SCP-3946 takes control of a train with passengers on-board, it can access its anomalous properties. SCP-3946's manifestation causes passengers on the train to become inexplicably happy and euphoric, regardless of their situation or mood at the time. Passengers have been known to dance, sing, and behave erratically while under SCP-3946's influence.

Further, any attempts to physically remove SCP-3946 from the cockpit will result in a violent, enraged reaction. SCP-3946 will attack anyone attempting to restrain or remove it from the cockpit, often causing significant property damage and serious injury.

Addendum 3946-01: Following incident #3946-A on ██/██/20██, where SCP-3946 caused [DATA EXPUNGED] fatalities, SCP-3946's classification has been upgraded to Euclid. Containment procedures have been revised to reflect the increased potential danger associated with SCP-3946's activities. SCP-3946 must be contained in a secure environment at all times, and its anomalous abilities neutralized.
