Item #: SCP-4417

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4417 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-4417 is to be granted only to Level 3 personnel or higher, and any interaction should be performed with caution to avoid triggering emotional responses.

Description: SCP-4417, also known as "Smiley," is a human male with orange stripes on his cheeks and pink parted hair. The most notable feature of SCP-4417 is its eyes, which are VR Rainbow LED. SCP-4417 is always seen wearing a medical mask and a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-4417 exhibits a strong sense of empathy and is able to understand the emotions of others with great accuracy. This ability has led to SCP-4417 being employed as a fast-food worker, where it frequently interacts with customers and employees. SCP-4417 has become a beloved employee due to its ability to make patrons feel better or help them see the humor in difficult situations.

SCP-4417's contagious cheerfulness has raised concerns among researchers, who fear its ability to manipulate the emotions of others. However, SCP-4417 has not displayed any signs of malevolence and has a generally positive demeanor.

Addendum: In a recent incident, SCP-4417 was exposed to a memetic agent that caused it to express negative emotions. The incident required significant containment efforts, as SCP-4417's emotional distress led to mass hysteria among Site personnel. As a result, researchers have recommended measures to prevent SCP-4417 from being exposed to any memetic hazards.
