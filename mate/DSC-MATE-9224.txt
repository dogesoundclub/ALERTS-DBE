Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9224 is to be monitored and contained within a secure interview room at all times. Any interaction with personnel is strictly forbidden without prior approval from a Level 4 Researcher. SCP-9224 will be provided with writing materials and a recording device at all times for the purpose of maintaining a record of its actions and observations.

Description: SCP-9224 is a male human identified as a reporter for a local news station. Its face exhibits multiple spots and a frightened mouth. It wears normal glasses, a bucket hat on its head, a two-color band on its forehead, and goggles on its forehead. Its ears have a green cross earring, and it often wears a red scarf as an accessory.

SCP-9224 displays a scatterbrained personality and has a tendency to forget appointments and get sidetracked easily. During interview sessions, it has demonstrated difficulty staying focused and coherent, often drifting off-topic or forgetting important details. However, SCP-9224 has also displayed a sharp wit and a talent for picking up on small details.

SCP-9224's anomalous properties manifest as a form of auditory and visual manipulation in those around it. Individuals in close proximity to SCP-9224 will experience aural and visual hallucinations that correspond with SCP-9224's current state of mind. These hallucinations primarily manifest as sudden changes in the environment, such as seeing objects disappear or hearing noises that aren't present. 

Addendum: SCP-9224 has been known to inadvertently activate its anomalous properties, causing confusion and potential harm to those around it. As such, it is imperative that SCP-9224 be strictly monitored and quarantined until a more thorough understanding of its abilities can be obtained.
