Dr. ██████: Good afternoon, DSC-MATE-9842. How are you feeling today?

DSC-MATE-9842: I'm feeling rather pleased with myself. I just finished a new creation that I think will blow everyone's mind.

Dr. ██████: Can you tell me more about your empathetic abilities and how they influence your designs?

When I work with a client, I try to tap into their fears and desires, and use that knowledge to create something that speaks to them on a personal level.

Dr. ██████: Some of your designs are quite unsettling. Can you explain why that is?

DSC-MATE-9842: (laughs) Ah, yes. Well, sometimes people's fears are unsettling, no? But really, I think that the unsettling nature of some of my designs is what makes them so powerful. I believe that fashion should make people feel something, and sometimes that means confronting them with uncomfortable emotions.

Dr. ██████: Your red scarf has been noted as a possible talisman that enhances your empathetic abilities. Can you tell me more about that?

DSC-MATE-9842: Ah, yes. My trusty scarf. I believe that it enhances my abilities by acting as a sort of conduit for my empathetic energy. When I wear it, I feel more in tune with the emotions of others, and I think that translates into better designs.
