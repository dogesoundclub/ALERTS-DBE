DSC-MATE-9779, also known as "The Hare of Heroism," is a sentient rabbit and firefighter employed by the Foundation. With a pair of nerd glasses covering his bright, inquisitive eyes and a Doge hat perched on his head, this anthropomorphic bunny is hard to miss.

Strapped to his left ear is a single jade earring, glinting in the light – perhaps a souvenir from one of the many worlds he's visited during his missions for the Foundation.

Despite his scatterbrained nature, DSC-MATE-9779 is a valuable asset to the Foundation. Armed with a whistle and a quick wit, he races into danger without hesitation, using his agility and sharp mind to rescue both humans and fellow anomalies alike.

His tendency to get sidetracked can cause some issues, however. It's not uncommon for him to forget important details or appointments, or to miss crucial bits of information while chasing after his latest fascination. But when the chips are down, DSC-MATE-9779 always delivers – even if he's a bit late to the party.

Handle with care, but trust in his bravery – for in the face of danger, DSC-MATE-9779 is a true hero.
