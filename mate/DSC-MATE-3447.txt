SCP-3447, also known as "The Jade Boss", is a humanoid entity classified as a Mafia Boss. Despite appearing as a human, SCP-3447 showcases a unique visual feature, having VR Jade LED eyes, giving off an unnatural and almost eerie luminescence. It is currently unknown how SCP-3447 acquired these unusual features, but it is speculated that it is due to paranormal or technological experimentation.

SCP-3447's attire is primarily a hoodie, which obscures significant features of its face, adding to its air of mystery. Additionally, SCP-3447 often wears a silver chain and is frequently seen smoking a cigarette. SCP-3447 displays a confident, domineering personality that exudes power and control. It is recommended that all personnel handling SCP-3447 treat it with caution due to its involvement in organized crime activities.

Despite SCP-3447's intimidating persona, it also demonstrates a tendency towards impulsive decision-making. Its impulsive nature has led to humorous situations in which SCP-3447 acts on emotions rather than logic, resulting in surprising or amusing outcomes for onlookers.

Caution is advised when handling SCP-3447, as the entity's unpredictable nature and affiliation with criminal organizations can lead to potential danger. All personnel tasked with SCP-3447's containment must adhere to strict security protocols, including following armed escort procedures and completing behavioral analysis training. Any instance of attempted escape or behavior outside of containment regulations will result in immediate disciplinary action.
