Item #: 9717

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9717 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel assigned to interact with 9717 are required to wear protective eyewear and earplugs to avoid potential cognitive hazards.

Description: Subject 9717 is a female human with blue clown-like eyes and a perpetually present smile on her green, disheveled head. An unusual marking on her forehead takes the form of goggle-like glasses that appear to have been permanently fused onto her skin. 9717 has a preference for gold earrings and often wears a silver chain around her neck. She is commonly seen holding a cigarette, which she'll use during her breaks to help cope with her stress.

Subject 9717 is a banker and uses her position to acquire vast wealth, though it's unknown if her financial management tactics are ethical or not. Her sense of humor and quick wit is a crucial element of her personality, frequently using comical stories and impressions to distract and manipulate others. Her effect on people causes them to overlook her shrewd business practices, leading to her being perceived as charming and personable.

Due to the conflicting nature of her personality and profession, Subject 9717 is to be monitored for any illegal activity, especially financial fraud that she may perform or facilitate. In the past, it’s been reported that 9717 uses her charisma to intimidate individuals to remain silent about her actions. This makes it difficult to prove she's involved in illicit activities. 

Addendum: Agent ████████, formerly embedded within 9717's banking institution, has reported that 9717 has been working for a group called The Brotherhood. Further investigation is required to determine the motives and goals of The Brotherhood and any possible relation to DogeSoundClub.
