Item #: SCP-9950

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9950 is to be monitored during her daily work as a train driver. A GPS tracker must be installed in her vehicle, and communication with her must be maintained at all times. SCP-9950 is allowed to interact with passengers, but must refrain from using her anomalous abilities in front of them.

Description: SCP-9950 is a human female who works as a train driver. She wears a purple cap with a headset, and has a goggle on her forehead. Her lips are colored purple, and she has orange eyebrows. She wears a red cross earring and a choker. SCP-9950's mouth is almost always covered by a medical mask.

SCP-9950 exhibits a natural charm and charisma that can make her the life of the party. She often tells jokes and performs silly dances to make others laugh. SCP-9950 is also capable of anomalous abilities that allow her to influence human emotions. She can make people feel happy or sad, angry or calm, based on her desired outcome. Some SCP researchers have speculated that her anomalous abilities may be linked to her purple lip coloration and orange eyebrows.

SCP-9950 has not shown to be aggressive, but testing must be done to verify if her abilities can be used for malicious purposes. SCP-9950 has expressed no knowledge or understanding of her abilities, and she has only been made aware of her containment due to a recent breach.

Addendum: SCP-9950 was found after reports of an "unusually happy" train ride. SCP agents were dispatched and found SCP-9950 acting jovially towards passengers. Upon initial questioning, SCP-9950 was unaware of her anomalous abilities. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of SCP-9950's abilities.
