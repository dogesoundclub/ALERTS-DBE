Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be monitored at all times and kept in a secure facility equipped with high walls and multi-layered security systems.

Description: Subject 6552 is a monkey of unknown origin. It stands at approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighs 45 kilograms. The subject has bright blue clown eyes that seem to absorb light and a pair of gold earrings dangling from its ears. It is often seen wearing a red scarf around its neck, which appears to have some significance to the subject.

Personality: 6552 exhibits a unique and highly empathetic personality. It demonstrates an instinctive understanding of human emotions and is often moved to tears or outbursts when observing others in distress. It also appears to have a fondness for animals and nature, often observed playing with insects and birds that find their way into its containment chamber. The subject's ability to understand and connect with others gives it an uncanny ability to influence people, making it a valuable asset in certain situations. However, its unpredictable emotional state and potential for empathic overload require caution in its handling.

Note: It is currently unknown how 6552 acquired its anomalous properties or what its ultimate purpose or agenda may be. Further investigation is ongoing.
