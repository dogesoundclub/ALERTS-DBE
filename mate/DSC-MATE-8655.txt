Item #: 8655

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Doctor 8655 is to be monitored at all times to ensure that their anomalous characteristics do not become a danger to themselves or others. They have been granted clearance to practice medicine, but their patients must be under close observation to ensure that no unexpected effects occur.

Description: Doctor 8655 is a human female with distinct characteristic features, including spots across their face, a red lip, and orange eyebrows. However, what sets them apart is their head, which is shaped like that of a pink rabbit. Their forehead also has a unique feature featuring two-colored bands, and they have gold earrings and a silver chain as accessories. They are often seen smoking a cigarette.

Doctor 8655 has a laid-back and easy-going personality, often downplaying their unique appearance as simply a quirk. However, they can become fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones, which can lead to unexpected outbursts of anger when a friend or family member is insulted. It is important to note that their protective nature may have a risk of violent or unpredictable behavior.

Addendum: Doctor 8655 has been found to have unexplained healing abilities that are not typical of human biology. Further testing is required to fully understand the extent of these abilities and potential limitations. Until then, they have been granted special clearance to continue practicing medicine under close observation. Any anomalous behavior must be reported immediately.
