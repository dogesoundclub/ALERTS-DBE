Item#: 4752

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 4752 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with access to a small library of educational materials. Personnel interacting with the entity must wear noise-cancelling headphones to avoid being affected by its whistle.

Description: 4752 appears to be a male monkey of the species Macaca Fascicularis, approximately 1.2 meters tall when standing, and weighing 20 kilograms. The entity's face displays a frightened expression with a small mouth, and is often seen wearing nerd glasses. A two-color band marks its forehead, and it features a jade earring in its left ear, as well as a red scarf around its neck.

The entity exhibits a passion for acquiring knowledge and can often be found reading educational materials or researching obscure topics. Its collection of books and documentaries is vast, and it has been known to share its knowledge with others in a highly enthusiastic manner.

Additionally, 4752 possesses a whistle, which it uses as a means of communication. The whistle carries a highly potent effect that can cause significant distress and confusion in those who hear it. Its use is restricted to emergencies and requires authorization from Level 4 personnel.

It is unclear how or why this entity gained such extensive knowledge and access to educational materials. No prior record of this entity has been found, and its origin is currently unknown.

Addendum 4752-01: On occasions, 4752 has been reported attempting to escape its containment cell to access additional educational materials. Personnel should remain vigilant and monitor any suspicious behavior that may indicate another breach attempt.
