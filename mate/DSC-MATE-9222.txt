SCP-9222 is a humanoid entity with notable features that distinguish it from other humans. Its face boasts a pair of orange stripes, giving the impression of feline-like markings, while its mouth appears consistently frightened. This feature leads observers to feel a constant sense of unease and suspicion when interacting with it.

Adding to the peculiarity of SCP-9222's appearance, the entity's eyes are adorned with nerd glasses, and its head is often concealed by a police cap. The cap's use is unknown but is suspected to create a sense of authority, which it hopes will garner respect from others. Its ears are adorned by a green cross earring, denoting possible religious affiliation.

An essential piece of SCP-9222's attire is the medical mask that covers the bottom portion of its face. This mask is reportedly worn due to a severe phobia of germs and an obsessive-compulsive disorder surrounding personal hygiene. It is unable to engage in any activity that poses even a remote chance of exposing it to germs.

Finally, SCP-9222 is seen consistently with a silver chain, initially thought to be solely fashion-oriented, but upon further observation, it seems to serve a more significant purpose.

SCP-9222's personality is data-driven and logical, making it an excellent candidate for its current profession, a lawyer. It enjoys analytical debate and may engage in arguments on subjects considered trivial or unimportant, leading to humorous situations.

Observers are to avoid startling or agitating SCP-9222 as it may trigger panic attacks or unwanted behaviours. Personnel interacting with it must follow rigorous decontamination procedures before and after every meeting.
