Item #: 3930

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The subject is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with one window for natural light. The chamber must have a soundproofing system to avoid any disturbances caused by the subject's vocalizations. The subject is permitted to keep their fashion designer tools as long as they are not considered harmful. Personnel interacting with the subject must be cautious at all times and must not make any sudden movements that could trigger an aggressive response.

Description: Item #3930, also known as "The Fashionable Tiger," is a sentient tiger of the male gender. The subject stands at 6 feet tall and has a lean, muscular build. The Fashionable Tiger is well-groomed, consistently donning a red beanie atop their head, a jade earring in their left ear, and normal glasses over their sharp eyes. Notably, they sport a pair of goggles on their forehead, which they can flip down if the need arises. 

The subject keeps a gold chain around their neck and carries a whistle, both of which they use to keep their coworkers in line.

The Fashionable Tiger has a strong sense of responsibility and discipline, making them a talented fashion designer. They have an eye for detail and are well-respected amongst their peers in the fashion industry. However, the subject also knows how to cut loose and enjoy themselves. They enjoy a good party and can often be found getting their colleagues to join them in singing and dancing. 

Under no circumstances should any personnel take the subject's sense of humor as a sign of weakness or underestimate their abilities. The Fashionable Tiger has sharp claws and teeth and is known to display aggressive behavior when threatened.

Addendum: The subject has recently been observed leaving their containment chamber without proper authorization. Personnel must take necessary steps to ensure the subject is secured at all times to prevent any further unapproved exits.
