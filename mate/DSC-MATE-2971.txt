SCP-2971, also known as "The Real Estate Baron," is a humanoid creature of unknown origin that appears to be physically human in all aspects, except for his peculiar features. SCP-2971 works as a real estate agent, often acquiring properties at deep discounts and reselling them at a much higher price. 

SCP-2971's most noticeable feature is his permanent smile that shows white teeth. His playful grin is complemented by his red clown eyes that emit an eerie glow. The head of SCP-2971 is made of metal, with a surprising purple hue. The creature's ears are adorned with an intricate jade earring, which blends the appearance into a strange contrast.

SCP-2971 often wears accessories including his favorite silver chain and a normal gas mask to protect himself in hazardous conditions.

Despite SCP-2971's unnerving appearance, they have a natural talent for leadership, taking charge of situations at work and in their social life. His personality is domineering and confident, making him a formidable negotiator in the cut-throat world of real estate. Researchers have yet to determine the exact source of SCP-2971's abilities or his strange physical properties, but his charm and leadership skills make him a valuable asset in the Foundation's efforts to maintain the balance between the supernatural world and everyday life.
