Item #: SCP-4024

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4024 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-██. All interactions with SCP-4024 must be monitored and recorded for further analysis. SCP-4024 is not allowed to attend any public events without prior approval from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-4024 is a female human of average height and weight, with an orange and green striped pattern on their face and a purple lip. Their eyes have an orange color and their eyebrows follow the same color scheme. SCP-4024's hair is green, and its maintenance has been left unchecked. The subject has a red cross earring on each ear, and they wear a silver chain around their neck. SCP-4024 is often observed smoking a cigarette. 

SCP-4024's personality is characterized by their idealistic tendencies, with a strong desire to make the world a better place, which sometimes lead to humorous situations, including protests and boycotting companies or causes they perceive as opponents to their values. SCP-4024 claims to be a politician, but no official records have been found to validate this statement.

SCP-4024 has an unusual ability to incite significant volumes of crowd attraction, and they use this ability to spread their political opinions among the masses. Attempts to interview SCP-4024 about their motives and opinions have been unsuccessful, as the subject has always repelled such questions with hostility, and its hostility towards Authority seems to grow on each occasion.

Addendum 1: Due to SCP-4024's demands, the Foundation has allowed the subject to participate in a few public meetings, with strict supervision by personnel. SCP-4024 has expressed its willingness to contribute to the containment of other anomalous entities in exchange for the authorization to liaise with a few key officials.

Addendum 2: During a recent interview, SCP-4024 claimed to have found its purpose within the Foundation, and it urged the Authority to release it from containment. The proposal has been denied, and all future interactions with SCP-4024 will be monitored more closely.
