Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1662 is permitted to continue with their occupation as a delivery driver, provided that they do not display any anomalous behavior during their shifts. Any witnesses or reports of 1662’s abnormal characteristics or abilities must be immediately reported to the nearest Foundation authority for assessment and further containment.

Description: SCP-1662 is a young adult human male, with striking orange stripes adorning his facial features. His mouth is consistently in a frightened expression, and his eyes are comprised of a VR jade LED. 1662’s head is covered by a novelty Doge hat, with a green cross earring attached to his left ear. He is also often seen sporting a red scarf and an LED gas mask.

SCP-1662 demonstrates a highly empathetic personality, with a deep understanding and appreciation for the emotions and well-being of others. He is highly susceptible to displaying strong emotional outbursts or even tears at the slightest indication of someone else’s pain or suffering, making it necessary to keep him away from highly emotional situations. In addition to this trait, 1662 also exhibits a soft spot for animals and nature, which may serve as his motivation for carrying out his job as a delivery driver.

While SCP-1662 does not appear to have any anomalous abilities, his unique appearance and empathetic character may indicate a deeper, more complex nature that should be thoroughly investigated in order to better contain and understand him.
