On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-6518 initiated a party in their containment chamber with several D-class personnel.

Shortly after the event began, several D-class personnel began exhibiting strange behavior and repeating DSC-MATE-6518's phrases and mannerisms. This event required amnestic treatment for all witnesses involved. DSC-MATE-6518's request to hold future parties has been denied.
