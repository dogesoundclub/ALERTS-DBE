SCP-3363 is a humanoid entity assigned to security duties within the Foundation's urban facilities. Subject appears to be a female of human origin, with unique physical attributes that set them apart from standard personnel. Notably, SCP-3363 exhibits numerous spots across their face, which are believed to be a result of an anomalous condition. Their red clown eyes also appear to be anomalous and have been confirmed to impede the ability of visual recognition technology. 

In addition to their peculiar features, SCP-3363 is often noted for their uncommon fashion choices. They can be seen sporting a bucket hat at all times, which they use to conceal their features from the outside world. Their ears are decorated with a single piece of gold earring, and they adorn a medical mask that they rarely remove. SCP-3363 completes their ensemble with a gold chain, potentially indicating their affinity for jewelry or personal style statements. 

While SCP-3363 has proven to be a capable and vigilant guard, they have also exhibited tendencies of recklessness that set them apart from their peers. They have been witnessed acting without thinking, resulting in minor accidents, and in some cases, mishaps. These actions appear to stem from a desire to impress others, and it is recommended that SCP-3363 undergoes evaluation for potential self-esteem or validation issues. 

Overall, SCP-3363 remains a mystery to the Foundation, with both their appearance and behavior raising numerous questions. Further investigation is required to determine if their anomalous abilities extend beyond appearance, and if their recklessness poses a risk to Foundation operations.
