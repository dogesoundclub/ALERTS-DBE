Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-418 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell must be furnished with various plants and other natural elements to ensure comfort for the subject. A daily supply of fresh vegetables and fruits must be delivered to the cell for consumption. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-418 must be supervised by at least two Level 2 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-418 appears to be a humanoid rabbit with a frightened mouth and VR Jade LED eyes. The subject wears a gold earring on its right ear, a red scarf around its neck, and carries a whistle at all times. DSC-MATE-418 identifies as male and works as a fashion designer in the human world.

DSC-MATE-418 possesses a deep empathy and understanding for others and shows high emotional intelligence. The subject is prone to emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering, occasionally leading to uncontrollable crying fits. DSC-MATE-418 has a fondness for animals and nature, and has demonstrated a unique ability to communicate with both.

DSC-MATE-418's fashion designs have been known to affect the behavior and emotional states of its wearers. Those who wear the garments become more empathetic and emotionally receptive, leading some Foundation personnel to question the origins of DSC-MATE-418's anomalous abilities.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-418 has requested an opportunity to collaborate with the Foundation's botanical research department to create garments infused with plant-based properties. A request that is currently under consideration by the Ethics Committee.
