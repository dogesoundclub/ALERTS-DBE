Item #: SCP-9588

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9588 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-9588's chamber is not restricted, except during scheduled maintenance or in case of emergency. SCP-9588 is allowed to maintain its position as Theater Manager at the local entertainment venue, subject to regular psychological evaluations.

Description: SCP-9588 is a middle-aged Caucasian male with a head of normal blonde hair and golden earrings. SCP-9588's most notable feature is a set of VR Rainbow LED eyes, which function as a non-intrusive form of sensory augmentation. SCP-9588 is also frequently seen wearing a silver chain necklace and carrying a candy stick as a personal accessory.

SCP-9588 has displayed a strong sense of empathy and emotional intelligence, making them ideal for their role as Theater Manager. SCP-9588 is often attuned to the emotions of others and can help people navigate difficult situations with a well-timed word or gesture. However, SCP-9588's empathic abilities are not fully understood and may pose a potential danger to both themselves and others.

Despite the potential risks, SCP-9588 has shown no inclination to use their abilities for malicious purposes. Due to their cooperative nature and lack of aggressive behavior, SCP-9588 is classified as Safe.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-9588 was exposed to an anomalous event during a live theater performance, resulting in a significant emotional and physical overload. While SCP-9588 has shown no lasting effects from the incident, this event underscores the potential risks of SCP-9588's empathic abilities and the need for ongoing containment and monitoring. Research into SCP-9588 and their abilities is ongoing.
