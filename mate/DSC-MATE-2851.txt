Item #: 2851

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2851 is to be monitored while working as a veterinarian at ████████ Animal Clinic. SCP-2851 is not to leave the containment area, unless supervised by Level 3 personnel. Any communication or interaction with SCP-2851 is to be recorded and analyzed for any potential anomalous occurrences.

Description: SCP-2851 is a female human, with notable facial features. Orange stripes are visible on the sides of her face, and she consistently wears red lipstick. Her eyes are cybernetic and display a VR rainbow LED. SCP-2851's head is of an 00s schoolgirl style.

SCP-2851 is known to wear two accessories - a silver chain and an LED gas mask. The LED gas mask is believed to enhance SCP-2851's emotional responses. Testing has indicated that SCP-2851 is highly in touch with her emotions and feels deeply moved by sentimental moments in movies, TV shows, music, and art. This disposition may be due to SCP-2851's anomalous attributes.

Addendum: It has been noted that SCP-2851 displays an affinity towards animals and has extensive veterinary knowledge. SCP-2851 has requested to take care of anomalous animals in the SCP Foundation's care. This request is currently under review by Level 4 personnel.
