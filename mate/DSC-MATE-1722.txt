Item #: SCP-1722

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1722 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. As a precautionary measure, all visitors to SCP-1722 are to present a Level 2 security clearance or higher. SCP-1722 is allowed to engage in car sales, as this is a valuable asset for the Foundation's various field operations.

Description: SCP-1722 is a Caucasian male in his mid-30s, standing at 5'11" (180.3 cm). SCP-1722 is notable for bearing a unique distinguishing feature, in the form of a black spot on his upper lip. Additionally, SCP-1722 wears a head accessory resembling the Doge meme from popular internet culture. SCP-1722 also wears a silver chain around his neck, which is believed to be of religious value to the subject.

SCP-1722's personality is characterized by a strong sense of responsibility and duty. This trait can lead to SCP-1722 over-exerting himself, often taking on more tasks than he can handle. Despite this, SCP-1722 is able to maintain a calm and polite demeanour, even under considerable stress.

SCP-1722's abilities are not currently known, but they are not believed to be anomalous in nature.

Addendum: SCP-1722 first came to the Foundation's attention in 20██, following the disappearance of several persons who had visited SCP-1722's car dealership. After a thorough investigation, the Foundation mediated the situation and contained SCP-1722 without incident. SCP-1722 has since been cooperating with Foundation efforts and has expressed genuine remorse for any harm he may have caused in the past.
