SCP-7214, codenamed "The Politician", is a male Rabbit of unknown origin. SCP-7214's frightened expression gives the illusion of innocence and vulnerability; however, it is highly advised to approach it with caution. SCP-7214's eyes remain a mystery, as its species does not usually possess such an intense, glossy look.

SCP-7214's green fur is often unkempt, giving the appearance of a disheveled politician. Its forehead holds an unusual goggle, perhaps aiding in its analytical and logical nature. SCP-7214 is never seen without its signature red scarf or candy stick, which it seems to enjoy immensely.

SCP-7214's personality is deceptive. Its dry sense of humor often catches its peers off guard, leaving them uncertain if it is genuinely teasing them or not. Despite its quirky demeanor, SCP-7214 often plays its role as a politician expertly, using its analytical nature to manipulate those around it effortlessly.

Caution is recommended when interacting with SCP-7214. Its sweet and innocent appearance may be misleading, and its analytical mind and use of emotional manipulation make it an unpredictable and potentially dangerous SCP.
