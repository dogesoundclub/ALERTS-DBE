Item #: SCP-2960

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2960 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any interaction with SCP-2960 must be supervised by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-2960's legal services are not to be utilized by Foundation personnel under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-2960 appears to be a male human of average height and weight, approximately 42 years old. The subject's most notable feature is a dark spot located at the corner of its mouth. SCP-2960's eyes are bright red, resembling those of a clown. SCP-2960 is consistently seen wearing a bucket hat and a silver chain around its neck. Additionally, SCP-2960 is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-2960's heightened observational skills are its most notable trait. The subject is able to detect even the slightest details and nuances in its surroundings. This ability makes SCP-2960 an excellent gift-giver, as it can tailor gifts specifically to each individual's preferences. However, this trait can also lead to SCP-2960 obsessing over finding the "perfect" gift, sometimes to the point of neglecting its other duties.

SCP-2960's legal expertise should not be underestimated. The subject is well-versed in many areas of law and has a talent for interpreting legal jargon with ease. However, SCP-2960's services should not be utilized by Foundation personnel, as the subject has been known to use its legal knowledge to manipulate others for personal gain.

Addendum: During initial containment, SCP-2960 was found to have a two-colored band on its forehead and a jade earring in its left ear. These features have been noted but do not appear to have any anomalous properties.
