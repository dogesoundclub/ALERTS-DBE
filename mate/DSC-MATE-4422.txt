SCP Foundation Document #4422:

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4422 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. Interaction with SCP-4422 must be supervised by at least one staff member with level 2 security clearance or higher. SCP-4422 is allowed limited access to medical facilities within Site-19 for the purpose of performing their job duties as a doctor.

Description: SCP-4422 appears to be an average human male with normal blonde hair and a frightened expression on his mouth. SCP-4422 frequently wears nerd glasses, a red victory band on his forehead, and a medical mask to cover his mouth. In addition, SCP-4422 often wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-4422's most prominent characteristic is their strong sense of intuition, which sometimes appears to be psychic in nature. SCP-4422 has shown the ability to predict events before they happen and sense when individuals are experiencing emotional distress. However, it is unclear whether these abilities are truly supernatural or merely the result of heightened empathy and observational skills.

SCP-4422's psychic abilities can be both impressive and unnerving to those around them, and they appear to struggle with the ethical implications of their intuition. SCP-4422 has expressed frustration with their inability to control their abilities and the ways in which they impact their daily life and work as a doctor.

Addendum: SCP-4422's psychic abilities do not appear to pose a threat to the safety or security of Foundation personnel. However, given their potential usefulness in certain situations, staff are encouraged to monitor SCP-4422's abilities and report any significant developments to their supervisor.
