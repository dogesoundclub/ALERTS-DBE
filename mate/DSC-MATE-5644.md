Item #: 5644

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5644 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-19. DSC-MATE-5644 is allowed to leave its containment chamber for a maximum of two hours per day for the purpose of fulfilling its role as a news anchor. DSC-MATE-5644 is to be monitored at all times while outside of its containment chamber to prevent its unauthorized use of its anomalous qualities.

Description: DSC-MATE-5644 is a monkey that wears horned rim glasses and has a 2-color band on its forehead. DSC-MATE-5644 also has a jade earring and a gold chain as additional accessories. Despite its anomalous qualities, DSC-MATE-5644 appears to be a normal monkey in all other aspects. DSC-MATE-5644 is male and possesses the ability to manipulate those around him to dance or sing along to his favorite songs. This ability is activated by DSC-MATE-5644 wearing its gold chain and can only be triggered by DSC-MATE-5644 itself.

DSC-MATE-5644 possesses a strong sense of responsibility and duty, which is an unusual feature for its species. However, it also enjoys having fun and can become the life of the party. DSC-MATE-5644's humorous personality and natural charisma are likely responsible for its previous success as a news anchor.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5644 was discovered when various reports of people suddenly breaking into song and dance were linked to its appearance in various news segments. The Foundation promptly contained DSC-MATE-5644 and began studying its anomalous qualities. It has been determined that DSC-MATE-5644's ability to manipulate people is not harmful, but could potentially cause unwanted attention if used outside of its news anchor duties.
