Item #: SCP-4229

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4229 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with apes and primates for regular socialisation. The gas mask must be checked every day for any potential malfunctions. SCP-4229 is not to be allowed access to any electronic communication devices.

Description: SCP-4229 is a male monkey believed to have escaped from a nearby circus or zoo. Upon discovery, SCP-4229 was found working as a reporter for a local news organisation. SCP-4229 is roughly 1.2 metres in height and has green hair with a purple cap. SCP-4229 also has a gold earring and wears a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-4229 is social and enjoys interacting with the other primates in its containment chamber. SCP-4229 is a prankster and often surprises others with its dance moves and silly antics. It has a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards its job as a reporter, however, and can become frightened when encountering danger. SCP-4229 has been observed to use an LED gas mask in order to protect itself from harmful effects of the environment it works in.

SCP-4229 is capable of speaking and using human language fluently, and has a good working relationship with Foundation personnel. However, it is advised that all interactions with SCP-4229 be kept professional and limited in order to prevent any potential breach of confidentiality or exposure to the public.
