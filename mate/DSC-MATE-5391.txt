Item #: SCP-5391

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5391 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with an appropriate supply of carrots and lettuce. Interactions with personnel are restricted to those with Level 2 clearance or higher and must be monitored at all times.

Description: SCP-5391 is a male anthropomorphic rabbit standing at 120 cm tall. It appears to be wearing a hoodie with a two-color band on its forehead and a silver chain around its neck. Its face features a frightened mouth and red clown eyes.

SCP-5391 works as a car salesman in a local dealership, which it uses as a cover for its true purpose. Its personality is that of a responsible and dutiful individual, sometimes resulting in humorous situations where it tries to handle more tasks than it can manage effectively.

SCP-5391's anomalous properties manifest when it is presented with a sale opportunity for a car. It has the ability to convince potential customers to purchase vehicles at exorbitant prices, often causing financial ruin for those affected.

SCP-5391's effect can be neutralized by providing it with high-quality vegetables, as it is unable to resist consuming them. Failure to provide a healthy diet will result in an increase in its persuasive abilities.

Addendum: Experiment Log

Test subject: D-4432

Procedure: D-4432 was instructed to resist SCP-5391's persuasion while provided a high-quality diet.

Results: D-4432 was successful in resisting SCP-5391's persuasion, resulting in no sale. SCP-5391's persuasive abilities appeared to decrease while under these conditions.

Conclusion: SCP-5391's abilities may be neutralized by maintaining a nutritious and healthy diet. Further research is needed to determine a long-term solution.
