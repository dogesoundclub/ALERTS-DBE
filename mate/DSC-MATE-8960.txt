Item #: 8960

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8960 is to be contained in a standard secure humanoid containment chamber with appropriate food, clothing, and monitoring. SCP-8960's cell is to be outfitted with industrial-grade ventilation and plumbing systems to accommodate SCP-8960's scent and bodily disposal needs. Any items brought into SCP-8960's containment chamber are subject to thorough decontamination procedures. Due to SCP-8960's ability to generate outlandish and dangerous ideas, interactions with SCP-8960 should be limited.

Description: SCP-8960 is a male rabbit, standing approximately 70 cm tall and weighing 55 kg. SCP-8960 wears a police cap on its head and a red scarf around its neck, along with a pair of goggles on its forehead and a jade earring on each ear. SCP-8960 is often seen with a cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-8960 has a highly creative and imaginative personality, often brainstorming new and unexpected solutions to problems, even if such ideas can be outlandish or dangerous. SCP-8960 has been observed to enjoy testing the reactions of others with its ideas, no matter how absurd they may seem. Despite its jovial nature, SCP-8960 has the potential to cause highly disruptive and dangerous situations.

Addendum: SCP-8960 was brought to the Foundation's attention after several incidents in which it caused significant property damage and injury to personnel. In one instance, SCP-8960 suggested the use of live explosives to repair a malfunctioning vehicle's engine. In another, SCP-8960 proposed fusing several industrial-grade power tools to create a "mega tool." Following containment, SCP-8960 has been deemed a significant liability, and its interactions with personnel are highly restricted.
