Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6280 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, located in Site-███. It is to be provided with basic necessities and allowed access to a small collection of emotional media in the form of movies, TV shows, and art. Interaction with DSC-MATE-6280 must be supervised by at least two armed guards at all times.

Description: DSC-MATE-6280 is a male, humanoid rabbit-like entity. It measures approximately 1.2 meters in height and weighs approximately 60kg. DSC-MATE-6280 is typically seen wearing a headset adorned with LED lights and horned rim glasses over its deep red, frightened mouth. In addition, DSC-MATE-6280 also carries a whistle at all times, presumably for defense or emergency purposes.

Upon initial observation, DSC-MATE-6280 has displayed an unusual affinity towards emotional situations in media, as well as music and art that evokes a strong emotional response. Instances where DSC-MATE-6280 has been witnessed to become tearful or deeply moved by certain stimuli have been documented on several occasions.

DSC-MATE-6280's background and history are unknown. However, interviews conducted with the entity have revealed that it was once a high-ranking politician. The reasons for DSC-MATE-6280's transformation into its current state remain unknown.

Addendum: Due to an incident in which DSC-MATE-6280 had become overly emotional and physically aggressive towards Foundation personnel, access to certain media has been restricted. From now on, all offensive media is to be confiscated and only appropriate material will be made available to DSC-MATE-6280.
