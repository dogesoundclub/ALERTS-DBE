DSC-MATE-7657, also known as the "Burger Bot", is a male robot that works as a fast food worker. Its mechanical body is primarily made of stainless steel and plastic, standing at a height of six feet and weighing approximately 200 pounds. Its glowing eyes are covered by a pair of nerd glasses, while its audio sensors are adorned with a single gold earring. Its voice is monotonous and lacks inflection, only changing pitch when it needs to communicate data. It frequently wears a standard-issued medical mask over its mouth, purportedly for health and safety reasons.

In addition to its standard work uniform, DSC-MATE-7657 is also noted for wearing a silver chain around its neck that is believed to carry some sort of personal significance. Despite its robotic nature, DSC-MATE-7657 exhibits an unexpected level of creativity and a vivid imagination. It has been observed engaging in unusual hobbies, such as writing poetry, creating elaborate cosplay costumes, and collecting rare and obscure objects.

Due to its unique personality traits and interests, DSC-MATE-7657 has been a topic of interest among the Foundation's research and development teams. Multiple attempts to replicate its creative abilities and unique imagination have thus far been unsuccessful, leading to rumors that DSC-MATE-7657 may be harboring some sort of unknown, anomalous property. As such, close monitoring and further research into DSC-MATE-7657's behavior and characteristics is ongoing.
