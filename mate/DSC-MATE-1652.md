Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1652 is to be kept under surveillance at all times. The subject is to be allowed to carry out her job as a traffic officer in a designated area, but regular check-ins and mental health assessments are required. Access to certain high-stress situations should be limited to avoid triggering aggressive behavior in the subject.

Description: Subject 1652 is a human female with distinctive spots on her face. Her eyes are a bright orange and her eyebrows are thick and prominent. Her head is adorned with short, wavy hair, styled in a witch-like fashion. The subject also wears a jade earring in her left ear, and a choker around her neck.

Subject 1652 has shown to be highly energetic and enthusiastic, often getting others excited about certain activities or events. While her enthusiasm can be contagious, it can also lead to some humorous situations when she becomes overly excited about something that others find mundane. However, this behavior can quickly turn into aggression and irritability when the subject is under high levels of stress.

It should be noted that the subject possesses no supernatural abilities or anomalies, but her behavior can be unpredictable under certain situations. Additional measures may be necessary if the subject's behavior escalates beyond containment.
