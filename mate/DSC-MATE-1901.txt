SCP-1901, also known as the "Traffic Officer," is a human male with striking blue clown eyes that have been reported to emit a strange, otherworldly glow under certain lighting conditions. SCP-1901's head has been replaced with a solid block of purple metal, impervious to all known forms of damage. His ears are pierced with a green cross earring, adding an unsettling level of religious iconography to his appearance.

SCP-1901 is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck, although its purpose or function remains unknown. Despite his intimidating appearance, SCP-1901 is a very attentive and observant individual. He possesses an uncanny ability to notice things that most people would miss, making him an ideal candidate for the role of Traffic Officer.

However, SCP-1901's attention to detail also has a darker side. He is known to become overly fixated on the idea of giving the "perfect" gift to individuals, spending excessive amounts of time agonizing over what to get them. It is unclear if this obsessive behavior is related to his anomalous properties or if it is simply a personality quirk.

Given his unique appearance and unusual behavior, it is recommended that all interactions with SCP-1901 be approached with caution. As with all SCP objects, any anomalies or deviations from standard human behavior should be reported to Foundation personnel immediately.
