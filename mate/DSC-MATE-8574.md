Item #: DSC-MATE-8574

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8574 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with CCTV cameras and reinforced steel walls. Access to DSC-MATE-8574's chamber is limited to Level-2 personnel or higher, and all interactions with DSC-MATE-8574 must be supervised.

Description: DSC-MATE-8574 appears to be a male fashion designer of robotic nature, standing at 1.8 meters tall. DSC-MATE-8574's most noticeable feature is a large green cyclops eye situated in the center of his face, which appears to be able to move independently from DSC-MATE-8574's head. DSC-MATE-8574 also wears a bucket hat and goggles on its forehead.

DSC-MATE-8574's personality has been observed to be highly detail-oriented, with a tendency to become obsessively focused on specific tasks or items, as evidenced by his alphabetized spice rack and color-coordinated closet. These traits may manifest in unexpected ways, such as spending hours perfecting the stitching on a dress or rearranging furniture in the containment chamber.

Despite DSC-MATE-8574's robotic appearance, it expresses emotions and requests like a humanoid would. For example, DSC-MATE-8574 has expressed a fondness for attending fashion shows and has requested access to materials to design clothing. However, due to a lack of understanding of DSC-MATE-8574's origin, requests and interactions must be closely monitored.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-8574's color-coding tendencies proved to be invaluable when it was discovered that the varying hues of a specific flower in DSC-█████'s containment chamber corresponded to different degrees of toxicity. DSC-MATE-8574's attention to detail averted a potential containment breach.
