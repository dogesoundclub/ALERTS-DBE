SCP-5082: The News Anchor Monkey

Item #: SCP-5082

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5082 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any and all objects in its possession are to be thoroughly inspected and evaluated for potential anomalous properties. All personnel who come into contact with SCP-5082 must undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure they are not susceptible to its nurturing personality.

SCP-5082 is to have access to a television or similar device at all times, where it will be allowed to watch news broadcasts and comment on them. SCP-5082's gas mask is to be kept in a secure locker when not in use.

Description: SCP-5082 appears to be a male monkey of the species Cercopithecus aethiops, standing at approximately 1.2 meters tall. It wears a pair of nerd glasses and has normal black hair. Its left ear has a jade earring, and it wears a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-5082's most notable feature is its LED gas mask, which it wears at all times. The mask emits a soft glow and appears to serve as a form of life support for SCP-5082.

SCP-5082 has a very caring and nurturing personality, extending to both living and inanimate objects. It has been observed giving names to its possessions, such as its gas mask, and talking to them as if they were sentient beings.

SCP-5082 appears to have a fascination with news broadcasting and frequently comments on news stories it watches. It has expressed a desire to become a news anchor itself.

Addendum: Incident Log 5082-1

On █/██/20██, SCP-5082's gas mask malfunctioned, causing it to enter a state of distress. Despite attempts by Foundation personnel to calm SCP-5082, it became increasingly panicked and distraught. Eventually, SCP-5082 removed the gas mask, revealing a second face beneath it.

The second face was identified as belonging to a human male, whose identity remains unknown. The man was unresponsive and appeared to be in a comatose state. SCP-5082 was immediately sedated and the man was removed from the mask.

Further investigation revealed that the man was connected to SCP-5082 through a series of anomalous neural linkages. It is currently unknown how this connection was established or what its purpose was.

SCP-5082 has since refused to wear the gas mask and has expressed a desire to have the second face removed. Further testing is ongoing to determine the nature of SCP-5082's anomaly and any potential risks it may pose.
