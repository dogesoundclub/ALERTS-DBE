Item #: 4161

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4161 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Due to their legal profession, they are allowed to have limited access to legal documents and resources deemed necessary for their job. Any attempts to harm or threaten SCP-4161 will result in immediate disciplinary action.

Description: SCP-4161 appears to be a male tiger, standing upright and possessing human-like features. Their facial expression is that of a frightened mouth, which contrasts with their clown-like red eyes. SCP-4161 has green hair and wears a purple cap, as well as a jade earring and a silver chain around their neck.

SCP-4161 possesses exceptional leadership skills and often takes charge of situations. They display a professional demeanor during their work as a lawyer and have proven to be successful in their field. However, SCP-4161 has a tendency to become easily overwhelmed and frightened, leading to instances where they require reassurance and support from others.

SCP-4161's species and physical appearance suggest a possible link to supernatural origins. Further investigation is needed to confirm this theory.

Addendum: Upon initial containment, SCP-4161 expressed concern about their safety and requested additional measures be taken to protect them from harm. They have since proven to be a cooperative and valuable asset to the Foundation. Any requests made by SCP-4161 for additional security measures must be considered and appropriately evaluated.
