SCP-3857, also known as "The Striped Politician", is a humanoid entity that manifests as a male human with distinctive orange stripes on his face. His most notable feature is a perpetually frightened expression etched on his mouth, framing his red clown eyes. He is often seen wearing a hoodie, hiding his features from public view.

Despite his unsettling appearance, SCP-3857 is a practiced politician with a natural talent for garnering support through his magnetic charisma. He has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but he also possesses an irreverent sense of humor that often leads him to be the life of the party. He has been known to spontaneously burst into song and dance, getting everyone around him to join in on his favorite tunes.

Although sometimes viewed as a jokester, SCP-3857 can be a formidable opponent when riled up. There are rumors that he possesses some form of anomalous ability that allows him to influence the decisions of others, a trait that makes him a valuable tool in political dealings. Those who cross him often find themselves regretting their decision later.

As with all SCP entities, SCP-3857 is to be contained in a secure facility to prevent him from using his abilities on unsuspecting humans. His potential for manipulation must be closely monitored at all times, as no one is quite sure what he is truly capable of.
