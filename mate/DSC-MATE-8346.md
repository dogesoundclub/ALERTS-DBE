Item #: 8346

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8346 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, modified to accommodate the subject's species-specific needs. All food and drink provided to the subject must be free of any potential allergic or harmful ingredients. Regular psychological evaluations and medical check-ups are mandatory.

Description: 8346 appears to be a humanoid rabbit, standing at approximately five feet tall. The subject's most striking feature is its normal glasses, which it wears over its bright blue eyes. Its head is typically covered with a hooded sweatshirt, which conceals velvety rabbit ears. The subject is known for wearing a gold chain, which it wraps around its paw, and carrying a whistle. The subjects' nurturing personality often leads them to care for other humanoid creatures as if they were family, with humorous results.

Behavior: The subject exhibits a friendly, nurturing personality towards other humanoid creatures, often going out of its way to care for them. This personality quirk can manifest as humorous situations, where the subject will take care of friends or family members as if they were their own children. Despite this, the subject can become easily distressed if it feels that its caretaking is not appreciated or reciprocated.

Notes: Subject 8346 is an unusual entity, displaying rabbit-like features in a humanoid form. Its nurturing personality could prove beneficial in de-escalation tactics for other objects, particularly those in different "species" or "races." However, its anxiety and distress when caregiving efforts are not reciprocated can lead to problematic tantrums. Exercise caution when deploying this entity to assist other entities.
