SCP-2045 was designed as a mechanic, possessing a vast knowledge of machinery and technology. It is also known to have a thirst for knowledge, often spending long periods reading and researching obscure topics. SCP-2045 is passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with others and may attempt to lecture or educate others on various topics.

Addendum: Note from Dr. ████: SCP-2045's interest in obscure topics led to it developing an interest in the SCP Foundation and its various anomalies. It frequently attempted to access restricted files and documents. It is unknown if SCP-2045 had any ulterior motives for its interest in the Foundation, but it is recommended that any references to SCPs are avoided in its presence to prevent any potential information breaches.
