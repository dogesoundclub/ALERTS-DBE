Description: Item 8132 is a male rabbit standing at approximately 4 feet tall. Its head is adorned with a Doge hat, showing the symbol of the "doge" cryptocurrency. On its forehead rests a red victory band, and it sports a gold earring on its left ear. It is often seen with a red scarf, which it wears around its neck.

The anomalous effects of Item 8132 manifest in its personality. It displays an overwhelming amount of empathy and compassion, often leading to it taking on other people's problems as its own. The Politician feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around it, which can be both admirable and exhausting.

The Politician displays the ability to influence those around it through its empathetic nature. It has been observed to use its persuasion to sway the opinions of those around it. This effect is heightened in group settings.

Addendum 8132-A: The Politician was recovered during a routine anomaly investigation at a local political rally. Witnesses described it entering the area unnoticed, and its mere presence was enough to inspire fervent support from the crowd. Foundation agents were dispatched, and the Politician was quickly contained.

Addendum 8132-B: Testing has revealed that exposure to the Politician's aura may alleviate negative emotions and promote peaceful behavior, making it a potential tool for containment of other Euclid and Keter class objects. However, caution is advised as extended exposure may have adverse effects on mental health.
