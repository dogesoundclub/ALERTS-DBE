SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-8081

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8081 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to his human nature, no restrictions on food or water intake are necessary, but standard measures to prevent suicide or self-harm should be in place. All interactions with SCP-8081 must be monitored and recorded by Foundation personnel.

Description: SCP-8081 appears to be a human male in his mid-thirties, with orange stripes on his face, a clown mouth, and blue clown eyes. He wears a short peak cap and a pair of goggles on his forehead. SCP-8081 can often be seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-8081 possesses a thirst for knowledge and is known to spend hours reading or researching obscure topics, displaying a strong passion for sharing his newfound knowledge with others. This quality often makes SCP-8081 an excellent asset for the Foundation in gathering information on anomalous phenomena.

SCP-8081's personality remains stable, but it is recommended that all contact with SCP-8081 is limited to professional interactions only, as SCP-8081 may become agitated if his intellectual interests are not satisfied.

Addendum: Despite his physical appearance, SCP-8081 has not demonstrated any anomalous abilities or behaviours, apart from his intense curiosity for knowledge. Any deviations from this baseline observation should be reported immediately to Foundation personnel for further investigation.
