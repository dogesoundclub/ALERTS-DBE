Description: DSC-MATE-1389 is a human female with spots covering her face, a set of red lips, and blue clown eyes. The subject’s head appears to be arranged in an unorthodox manner and is constantly moving, although there is no visible indication of injury or mutation. DSC-MATE-1389 is often seen wearing a choker and smoking a cigarette.

DSC-MATE-1389 presents with a strong and decisive personality, often coming across as bossy or intimidating. Despite this demeanor, it is clear that DSC-MATE-1389 is only interested in ensuring that tasks are completed in an efficient and effective manner. It is hypothesized that this behavior stems from the subject's profession as a banker prior to containment.

DSC-MATE-1389 has demonstrated an ability to influence the financial decisions of those around it, often convincing individuals to make decisions that are not in their best interests. As a result, access to any financial accounts or transactions is strictly prohibited.
