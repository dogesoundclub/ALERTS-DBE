9204 possesses the ability to manipulate others into doing his bidding. He tends to be very organized and efficient, which can sometimes come across as a bit controlling. This can lead to humorous situations, such as taking charge of group projects or events and delegating tasks to others in a very matter-of-fact way. However, his powers are not to be underestimated, as he can quickly turn any situation to his advantage.

It is believed that 9204 gained his powers through some sort of unknown magical ritual, and it is suspected that he may have ties to several other powerful magic users and villains in the area.
