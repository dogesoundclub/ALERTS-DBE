Item #: SCP-2860

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2860 is to be contained within a standard humanoid robot containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-2860 must be restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher, with all visits under video surveillance. SCP-2860 is to be provided with one pack of cigarettes per day, with approval from its assigned psychologist. In the event of unauthorized use of cigarettes, the pack is to be confiscated immediately.

Description: SCP-2860 is a male humanoid robot, standing at approximately 6’2” in height. Its appearance resembles that of a middle-aged reporter, with a green cyclops eye and ski goggle eyes. SCP-2860 wears a short peak cap on its head and sports a goggle on its forehead. SCP-2860 has been observed smoking cigarettes, although it does not require it for sustenance.

SCP-2860 exhibits a spontaneous personality and may take risks, which can result in humorous situations. During interviews, SCP-2860 will often interrupt and ask unexpected questions or make unexpected statements. SCP-2860 has expressed a preference for reporting on urban legends and supernatural occurrences.

Addendum: SCP-2860 was brought into Foundation custody after a viral video circulated showing it jumping off a cliff into a body of water. SCP-2860 claimed it was reporting on a local legend of a water-resistant humanoid monster. Upon retrieval, SCP-2860 was found to have sustained damage to its chassis, and its access to cigarettes was restricted. SCP-2860 has since cooperated with Foundation personnel and has not attempted any further high-risk behavior.
