Item #: 9135

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9135 is to be contained at their place of work, the news studio headquarters. Regular monitoring of their on-air broadcasts is necessary to ensure that their anomalous properties do not become publicly known.

Description: Subject 9135 is a male news anchor, possessing a unique set of physical attributes and personality traits. Their face features include spots and a perpetually present smile, which may contribute to their popularity among their viewers. However, it is their eyes that are the most anomalous characteristic; they are made of VR jade LEDs and have the ability to display text messages and other digital information.

Subject 9135 also wears a hoodie and a red scarf as staple accessories, but it is their normal gas mask that is of particular interest. The mask is believed to offer Subject 9135 some level of protection against possibly hazardous airborne substances or environments. The reasons for this are unknown, and further study is recommended.

Aside from their unique appearance, Subject 9135 is known for their outgoing and social personality. They enjoy being the center of attention and are known to tell amusing stories and jokes that cause uncontrollable laughter among their audience. This trait should be monitored, however, as it may attract more attention than is desirable.

Overall, Subject 9135 represents a potential breach of the Veil and should be monitored closely to ensure their anomalous properties do not become publicly known.
