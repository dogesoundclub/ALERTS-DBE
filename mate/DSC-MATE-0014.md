Description: DSC-MATE-14 is a male rabbit of unknown origin, standing 1.5 meters in height with a retro cap on his head and a frightened mouth. Its eyes are replaced with virtual reality rainbow LED. They are usually seen wearing a silver chain and a gold earring.

DSC-MATE-14 seems to possess an uncanny ability to sense the emotions and intentions of those around him, often predicting events before they happen. Their abilities border on being psychic, and many have reported feeling uneasy in their presence.

The subjectâ€™s personality is elusive, constantly fluctuating between friendly and foreboding. It is suspected that their abilities and appearance may be linked to an anomalous event or experiment.

DSC-MATE-14 was initially found involved in local politics, quickly climbing the ranks and gaining notoriety for their persuasive abilities. However, they were quickly identified as anomalous and captured by Foundation operatives.

Although DSC-MATE-14 poses no immediate danger, researchers remain cautious due to the uncertainty around their abilities and personality.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-14 has expressed a desire to participate in experimental testing as long as they are not harmed in any way. Their willingness to cooperate appears to stem from a desire to understand their own abilities further. Request for testing has been submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval.
