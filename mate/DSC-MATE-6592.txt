Item #: SCP-6592

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6592 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit within Site-██. SCP-6592 is permitted to have access to writing utensils and legal documents within its living area for work-related purposes only. Any personal items are subject to inspection and approval by Level 2 personnel. Provision of candy sticks as a reward for cooperative behavior is allowed but only under supervision.

Description: SCP-6592 is a humanoid rabbit, approximately 1.5 meters in height. It usually wears a hoodie, normal glasses, and a red victory band around its forehead. Its most distinctive feature is its ability to gift-giving, which it views as a crucial aspect of its daily life.

SCP-6592 possesses an extraordinary observation and attention to detail skills, making it an exceptional gift-giver. However, this approach can be detrimental to SCP-6592's psychological health, as it may obsess over finding the perfect gift or become excessively anxious about forgetting a particular item.

SCP-6592 possesses high intelligence, excellent communication skills, and the ability to comprehend law processes flawlessly. It is a practicing lawyer, and its legal work is instrumental in Site-██'s operations. Although SCP-6592's contribution has been significant, the Foundation has enforced strict guidelines to ensure SCP-6592's mental stability.

SCP-6592 tends to be cooperative, reliable, and pleasant to interact with, but it has shown signs of depression and anxiety in times of stress. Any changes in SCP-6592's behavior must be reported immediately to prevent destabilization. 

Addendum: SCP-6592's candy stick should be a prevalent part of any interactions with the entity as it has a positive effect on SCP-6592's mental state. Direct orders must be delivered firmly but with a friendly approach to prevent acting out due to anxiety.
