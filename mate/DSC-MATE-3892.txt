Item #: SCP-3892

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3892 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with access to basic amenities. Any attempts to give SCP-3892 privileges or undue influence must be strictly monitored and controlled. Cooperation with SCP-3892 is encouraged, but any attempts to go against Foundation protocol must be met with discipline.

Description: SCP-3892 appears to be a male rabbit possessing a particularly strong sense of independence. Despite its job as a real estate agent, SCP-3892 has been known to disregard orders or take unauthorized leaves of absence. SCP-3892 is commonly observed wearing a bucket hat and horned rim glasses, with a pair of goggles on its forehead and a jade earring in one ear. It also carries a cigarette, which it is often observed smoking.

SCP-3892's rebellious streak can be attributed to its strong sense of individuality. While difficult to work with at times, SCP-3892 has proven to be a valuable resource for intelligence gathering and covert operations. However, any attempts to sway SCP-3892 to deviate from Foundation protocol must be met with caution.

SCP-3892's true origin is unknown, but it is believed to have been born with anomalous properties. Its unusual appearance and behavior strongly suggest that it is not of natural origin.

Addendum: Despite its difficult nature, SCP-3892 has proven to be a valuable asset in several operations, often due to its keen observational skills and quick thinking. As such, it is recommended that SCP-3892's containment be adjusted accordingly, should its usefulness be required in future operations.
