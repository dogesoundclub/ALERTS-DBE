DSC-MATE-6909’s most notable features are her red clown eyes, red lips, and a red cross earring.

DSC-MATE-6909 has expressed idealistic tendencies and often participates in activities such as protesting, boycotting, and activism to promote her ideologies. Despite her strong desire for justice, DSC-MATE-6909's behavior often hinges on a chaotic, unpredictable nature, which can lead to conflict in appropriate situations.

DSC-MATE-6909 has been observed having an unbreakable attachment to her cigarette, which can cause her to become irrational and agitated when not in possession of one. This behavior has led to the need for a limited supply of cigarettes available to DSC-MATE-6909 during her containment.
