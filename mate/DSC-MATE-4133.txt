Item #: 4133

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4133 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel are required to announce their presence before entering SCP-4133's cell, as the entity may be easily startled and is prone to manifest sporadic, potentially dangerous behavior.

Description: SCP-4133 appears to be a human male in his late 40s, standing at approximately 6'3" in height. The entity displays notable physical abnormalities, notably a set of orange stripes on his face and a police cap atop his head. The subject's eyes are covered by what appears to be a pair of ski goggles, and a gold earring is present in his left ear. SCP-4133 typically wears a gold chain and an LED gas mask, which seems to serve no discernible purpose but may be related to his occupation as a lawyer.

Personality-wise, SCP-4133 is rather absent-minded and often forgetful. The entity has difficulty attending scheduled engagements or keeping track of time due to frequent episodes of wandering thought. Despite his potential to cause comedic situations, SCP-4133 has the potential to become hostile when startled or provoked.

Addendum: SCP-4133 was recovered from an abandoned law firm in downtown ████████. The subject has been cooperative with Foundation personnel and has provided information regarding the practices of various anomalous law firms in the area. Further investigation into these firms is ongoing.
