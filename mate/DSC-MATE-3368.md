DSC-MATE-3368, designated by the Foundation as "The Hare", is a humanoid rabbit of unknown origin currently employed as a fast food worker in an undisclosed location. The subject's frightened mouth and nerdy glasses give the impression of a meek and submissive individual, but their natural talent for leadership indicates the presence of hidden potential.

The Hare's blue bandana and gold earring make them easily distinguishable from other rabbits of their kind. The addition of a red scarf and candy stick to their attire further reinforces their unique identity.

Despite their outward appearance and position as a fast food worker, The Hare displays a surprisingly formidable personality, often taking charge of various situations both in and out of the workplace. The subject's capabilities as a leader are both impressive and concerning, as their true motives and intentions remain unknown to the Foundation.

Further research and observation are required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-3368's abilities and potential threat level. Until such time, The Hare is to be monitored closely and treated with caution.
