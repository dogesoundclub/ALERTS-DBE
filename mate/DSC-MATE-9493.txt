Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9493 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Any and all repairs required for the containment chamber or other equipment within are to be conducted under close supervision, as SCP-9493 has demonstrated a proclivity for unconventional repairs that may compromise containment. SCP-9493 is not to be allowed access to tools or equipment that could be used to escape, and all personal items such as the choker and red cross earring are to be confiscated upon containment.
