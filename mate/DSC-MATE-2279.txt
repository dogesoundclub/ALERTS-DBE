Item #: 2279

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2279 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber and provided with a daily ration of bananas for sustenance. Any deviation from its prescribed diet may result in unpredictable or hazardous behavior. Personnel are advised to avoid direct eye contact and physical contact with SCP-2279 at all times.

Description: SCP-2279 is a male monkey of an unknown species, approximately 0.8 meters in height. Its head is adorned with a "Doge" themed hat, and a two-color band adorns its forehead. SCP-2279 is often seen with a jade earring hanging from one of its ears and holding a cigarette in its hand.

SCP-2279's behavior is introspective, often lost in thought or daydreaming while performing its duties as a fast food worker. This has led to several humorous mishaps, such as mistakenly serving a customer a burger sans meat or tripping over various items while lost in thought. Such incidents pose no harm to SCP-2279 or surrounding personnel.

When provoked, SCP-2279 displays a high level of agility and endurance. Its ability to climb surfaces and utilize nearby objects has made it a formidable opponent in close-quarters combat. However, SCP-2279 has no known offensive capabilities.

Addendum: Due to the potential for accidental injury or breach of containment, all staff are to exercise extreme caution when interacting with SCP-2279. Any deviation from standard containment procedures must be approved by Level 4 personnel.
