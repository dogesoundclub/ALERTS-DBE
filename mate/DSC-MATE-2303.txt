Item #: 2303

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2303 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. No special measures are required for containment, as subject 2303 is cooperative and displays no anomalous behavior. The containment cell is to be equipped with standard amenities. Subject 2303 is allowed appropriate reading material and a computer with internet access for personal use.

Description: Subject 2303 is a human male of average height and weight with a distinct appearance. Their face features a dark spot around the mouth area and a perpetual smile, which creates an eerie effect on the observer. Subject 2303 also wears a pair of nerd glasses, a retro cap, a red scarf, and a gold earring on their left ear. A two-color band adorns their forehead. They work as a fast-food worker outside of the containment cell, but their position requires no interaction with civilians. 

Subject 2303, while sociable and non-threatening, displays a deep curiosity about the world, which borders on obsession. They may randomly produce obscure facts, even in inappropriate or socially awkward situations. Subject 2303 enjoys researching and reading books, often focusing on unusual topics that most people would find boring. They have a vast array of knowledge about minor details of human history and culture, raising the suspicion of certain Foundation personnel. Further interviews suggest no malicious intent, and the subject demonstrates no other anomalies apart from their odd behavior.

Addendum 1 - Excerpt from Subject 2303’s Personal File:

"I don't know why it's important, but I've always been fascinated by obscure trivia. Like the fact that the ancient Egyptians used crocodile dung as a form of contraceptive, or that the Amazon River is home to a pink freshwater dolphin of a rare species. I have a thirst for knowledge that can never be satisfied, and it's only the beginning." 

Note: Subject 2303's fondness for trivia does not qualify as an anomaly, and their containment remains classified as Safe. Future research into the subject's past and the cause of their behavior may be conducted if new information arises.
