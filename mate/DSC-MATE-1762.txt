Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Identification number 1762 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within a secure facility. The subject is to be restrained at all times, as it has demonstrated a tendency to act impulsively and unpredictably. The containment chamber is to be monitored at all times via CCTV cameras and audio sensors.

Description: Identification number 1762 appears to be a human male with distinctive features, including spots on the face and ski goggles for eyes. The subject's head is made of a metallic purple material, with a single jade earring adorning each ear. The subject is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick as accessories.

Despite these unusual physical features, the subject's personality is perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of their behavior. They can be highly impulsive and have a tendency to act on their emotions instead of thinking things through. This can lead to some humorous situations, as the subject often makes spontaneous decisions that others find amusing or surprising.

It is important to note, however, that identification number 1762 is also highly dangerous. The subject has demonstrated a willingness to harm others in pursuit of their goals and has shown a particular interest in developing powerful magical abilities. As such, caution is advised when interacting with the subject, and all personnel should be prepared to defend themselves if necessary.

Additional Notes: Despite the risks posed by identification number 1762, there is evidence to suggest that the subject possesses a great deal of knowledge about the supernatural world. It is possible that further study of the subject could yield valuable insights into the nature of urban magic and other paranormal phenomena. However, any attempts to communicate with the subject should be handled with extreme care, as their unpredictable nature poses a significant risk to both themselves and others.
