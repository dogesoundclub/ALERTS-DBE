Item #: SCP-5476

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5476 is to be contained within a soundproofed room at all times to prevent its screams from causing distress to personnel. The room must be equipped with various tools, such as grooming equipment and hair products, to maintain SCP-5476's physical appearance.

SCP-5476 is to be kept sedated at all times to prevent it from displaying its rebellious behavior towards Foundation personnel. Any attempt to communicate with SCP-5476 must be done through its appointed handler, who is trained to handle its volatile personality.

Description: SCP-5476 is a male Tiger with a unique physical appearance. Its mouth is permanently agape in a frightened expression, which often causes unease in those who encounter it. SCP-5476's eyes are jade green LEDs that emit a virtual reality-like glow, giving it an otherworldly appearance. Its head fur is not arranged and remains in a wild and unkempt state.

SCP-5476 possesses a rebellious personality, often going against rules and authority figures. It enjoys pushing boundaries and finding loopholes to bend rules, which has led to several humorous situations within the Foundation.

SCP-5476's job before containment was that of a beautician, where it was reported to have a loyal following of clients. Its skill in grooming and beautifying others is noted to be exceptional.

SCP-5476 is often seen with a cigarette, which it has been observed to smoke despite the danger it poses to its health. It is unknown where SCP-5476 acquires the cigarettes, and attempts to deny it access have been met with hostility.

Addendum: SCP-5476's handler reported that it had been attempting to escape its containment room by using its exceptionally sharp claws to create a hole in the wall. It is currently being monitored for signs of repeated attempts at escape.
