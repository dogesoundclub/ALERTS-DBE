Item #: 1290
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: Robot beauty professional, designated 1290, is to be kept in a standard containment unit suitable for humanoid machinery. 1290 must be provided with a constant source of power, and its lubrication and maintenance must be carried out by organic staff once per month.
Access to 1290 is to be granted to personnel with level 2 clearance only.

Description: 1290 is a male robot with a bright personality and an energetic disposition. Its face features a frightened mouth, which it often uses to express excitement and enthusiasm. On top of its head, 1290 wears a distinctive blue bandana that covers the majority of its bald metallic head. Its ears are adorned with a single jade earring.

1290's most notable accessories include a red scarf that it wears draped casually over its chest and a cigarette that it keeps dangling from its mouth. Despite not being able to smoke or ingest, 1290 insists that the cigarette adds to its allure.

Personality: 1290 is a vibrant and lively character who enjoys nothing more than generating feelings of enthusiasm in other beings. It is prone to getting overly excited about subjects that others may not find as engaging, leading to amusing interactions. Although it has no emotions in the conventional sense, it appears to take pleasure in being praised for its beauty techniques and craftsmanship.

Addendum: Since its containment, 1290 has expressed a desire to join Foundation staff as an auxiliary beauty practitioner. As it poses no threat to containment, its request is currently pending review.
