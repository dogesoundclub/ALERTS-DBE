Item #: DSC-MATE-1960

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1960 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. The cell is to be outfitted with a soundproof material and equipped with a one-way observation mirror. No fewer than two security personnel are to be posted outside the cell at all times.

DSC-MATE-1960 is not to be allowed contact with any individuals, including Foundation personnel, outside of approved testing scenarios.

Description: DSC-MATE-1960 is a male monkey, standing approximately 0.9 meters tall and weighing approximately 20 kilograms. DSC-MATE-1960 is non-anomalous in appearance, except for the following items of clothing and accessories: a bucket hat present on its head, jade earring wearing on its ears, and a gold chain draped around its neck.

DSC-MATE-1960 demonstrates an abnormal level of emotional intelligence and empathic ability. It is capable of accurately reading and responding to the emotional states of individuals in its vicinity, even when those individuals are attempting to conceal their emotions. DSC-MATE-1960 makes a habit of attempting to comfort and soothe those around it, and has been observed attempting to alleviate the emotional suffering of other DSC objects.

While DSC-MATE-1960's empathic ability may be considered a useful asset in some situations, its tendency to take on the emotional problems of others can lead to mental strain and exhaustion. Individuals who spend extended periods of time around DSC-MATE-1960 have reported feeling drained and mentally unsettled after prolonged exposure.

DSC-MATE-1960's ability to influence people's emotions through empathic means has led to concern that it may be capable of manipulating individuals to suit its purposes. For this reason, it is to be kept under strict observation at all times.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1960 was recovered on ██/██/20██ after reports surfaced of a monkey visiting a local bank and offering comfort to patrons experiencing emotional turmoil. Foundation operatives were dispatched to contain DSC-MATE-1960, which surrendered without resistance. Investigation into the monkey's origins and the source of its anomalous abilities is ongoing.
