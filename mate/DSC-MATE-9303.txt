Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9303 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. The room should be decorated with various trinkets and toys to accommodate SCP-9303's playful temperament.

Description: SCP-9303 is a male white rabbit that stands 1.2 meters tall when standing on its hindlegs, with VR Jade LED eyes and wearing a Retro Cap, a Gold Earring, and carrying a Candy Stick.

SCP-9303 refers to itself as the Theater Manager, and claims to have a history of managing various theaters throughout the world since the 17th century. Although SCP-9303 speaks English fluently, it often communicates in a high-pitched voice and tends to add a lot of whimsy to its words.

SCP-9303 possesses a somewhat impulsive nature and displays a constant need to control its environment. Its behavior is often idealistic, and SCP-9303 has a strong desire to make the world a better place. However, this can sometimes lead to conflicting situations, such as boycotting companies and causes that SCP-9303 finds to go against its values.

- Intangibility: SCP-9303 can slip in and out of solid objects at will, but it must be within the object's dimensions.

- Telekinesis: SCP-9303 can move objects without touching them.

- Levitation: SCP-9303 can levitate up to three meters off the ground.

Addendum: SCP-9303 has expressed an interest in performing for Foundation personnel. This request is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
