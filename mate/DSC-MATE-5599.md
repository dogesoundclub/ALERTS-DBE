Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5599 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with specialized filters to neutralize any potential toxins that may be emitted upon the removal of DSC-MATE-5599's gas mask. Personnel are to refrain from interacting with DSC-MATE-5599 unless for testing purposes, and communication must be done through a speaker system. Any requests for legal representation must be assigned to another lawyer, and DSC-MATE-5599's personal belongings must be cataloged and studied for potential anomalous properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-5599 is a female human of unknown age, with distinct orange stripes on her face and an orange side shave on her head. Her eyes are blue and similar to clown makeup. She wears a gas mask over her face at all times, except during testing, which reveals that she possesses a unique ability to emit a deadly toxin from her mouth and nose, proving lethal to all biological entities within close proximity.

In addition to her appearance, DSC-MATE-5599 wears a gold chain and green cross earring, as well as a goggle on her forehead. Personnel should exercise caution around her, as she is capable of emitting her toxin through the eyes and ears, as well. Despite her dangerous abilities, DSC-MATE-5599 displays a gentle demeanor and a deep empathy for others. Her fondness for animals and nature is notable, making her willing to communicate about crime against nature and considerate in the extermination of some animals.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5599 is also a practicing lawyer, with her legal services attracting a wide range of clients, including anomalous entities. Her unpredictable nature, combined with her abilities, raise concerns for the containment of anomalous objects within legal disputes. Efforts have been made to limit her involvement in these proceedings or to provide her clients with other legal representation. DSC-MATE-5599, due to her abilities, has become a valuable asset for the Foundation in anomalous-related legal situations.
