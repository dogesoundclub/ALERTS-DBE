SCP-4166 is a human male delivery driver with a distinctive mouth spot and eerie red clown eyes. His shaven head is reminiscent of a monk, while a chunky gold chain dangles from his neck. However, the most striking feature of SCP-4166 is his LED gas mask. This mask, seemingly glued to his face, emits a bright light, obscuring his expressions and making any verbal communication challenging.

SCP-4166 has a significant drive for idealism and holds an unshakable desire to make the world a better place. He may go to extreme lengths to uphold his beliefs, such as boycotting or protesting companies or causes that contradict his values. SCP-4166's determination to make a difference can lead to him becoming the butt of jokes among his peers. Still, his commitment to creating a better world is a trait that should not be overlooked. 

SCP-4166 is to be regarded with caution and handled only by experienced staff due to the potential escalation of situations that might arise from his impenetrable beliefs.
