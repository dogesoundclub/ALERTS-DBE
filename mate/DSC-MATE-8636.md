DSC-MATE-8636, codenamed "The Farmer", is a humanoid rabbit of unknown origin. The subject stands at 1.2 meters in height and has white fur covering its body. Its most noticeable features are its VR Jade LED eyes which glow a bright green color, giving the impression of a cybernetic implant. 

The subject sports a goggle on its forehead, likely a utility tool for its farming duties, and a gold earring on its left ear. DSC-MATE-8636 can frequently be seen carrying a candy stick, which it may offer to others as a sign of goodwill. 

DSC-MATE-8636 displays personality traits typical of its species, with a caring and nurturing disposition. It displays affection towards those it perceives as family or friends and will often act in a parental manner, regardless of their age. This has resulted in humorous situations where the subject will attempt to care for individuals as if they were its own children. 

Despite DSC-MATE-8636's friendly demeanor, Foundation personnel are advised to exercise caution when approaching the subject as it is unknown if it possesses any anomalous abilities. While DSC-MATE-8636 has not exhibited any hostile behavior, it is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment room and monitored at all times.
