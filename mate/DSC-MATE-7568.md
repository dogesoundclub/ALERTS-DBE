Item #: 7568

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7568 is to be monitored at all times and is not permitted to interact with any inanimate objects outside of designated testing areas. Any interactions with said objects must be reported immediately to the supervising researcher.

Description: Subject 7568 is a human male, identified as a news anchor for a local television station. His most notable characteristic is his unusual choice of accessories. He sports a pair of yellow ski goggles instead of regular eyewear and a bright red scarf around his neck. The subject also wears an LED gas mask, which he claims is for "health reasons." His head is shaved except for a long mohawk made of vibrant pink hair, adding to his overall eccentric appearance.

It is noted that the subject tends to show deep affection and nurturing tendencies towards non-living objects, which includes naming his car and anthropomorphizing household appliances. These idiosyncrasies have caused several instances of containment breaches, including a toaster which subject 7568 had named "Benny." Benny was reported to have "malfunctioned" and began emitting sparks and flames, causing minor damage to the facility.

Testing has been conducted to ascertain whether or not these tendencies are manifestations of anomalous abilities. Thus far, no conclusive evidence has been found.

Personality: Subject 7568 is very personable and friendly, often exhibiting a deep concern for the well-being of others. He has a tendency to dote upon those he perceives to be in need of assistance, and his nurturing instincts extend to animals as well. Overall, Subject 7568 is a curious anomaly and requires constant supervision to ensure his unique personality traits do not result in further breaches of containment.
