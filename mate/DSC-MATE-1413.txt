Item #: SCP-1413

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1413 is to be kept in a standard individual containment chamber located in Site-19. Access to SCP-1413 is limited to Level 2 personnel and above. Any interaction with SCP-1413 must be logged in order to prevent any potential breach of secrecy.

Description: SCP-1413 is a human male, visually identifiable by the presence of several spots on his face. Additionally, SCP-1413 has a frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes. His head is adorned with a peak spike and his ears are pierced with a green cross earring. SCP-1413 is often seen wearing a silver chain around his neck and carrying a candy stick.

SCP-1413's most notable characteristic is his unique thought process. He has an incredible knack for knowing what others are thinking and can come up with innovative ideas on the spot. Although this trait is useful in solving problems, SCP-1413 has a tendency to suggest outlandish solutions that border on impossible, just to gauge the reactions of others. This has led to several humorous situations.

 SCP-1413's profession is that of a banker, and he is fully capable of carrying out his job with efficiency. However, due to his unique thought patterns and unpredictable nature, it is advised to keep him under surveillance at all times.

Addendum: SCP-1413 has shown no signs of exhibiting anomalous properties, but his natural ability to create new ideas and solutions is valuable to the foundation. An evaluation of his potential as an asset is currently being considered.
