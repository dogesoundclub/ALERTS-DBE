SCP-3258, also known as "The Politician," is a male rabbit of unknown origins. The subject is often seen wearing a purple cap and sporting green hair, a fashion statement that has yet to be explained. SCP-3258's facial expression is notable, with a mouth that remains in a constant state of panic, likely due to the subject's profession.

It is believed that SCP-3258 is capable of manipulating the VR Jade LED eyes that are displayed in place of typical rabbit eyes. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of this ability.

The subject is often seen smoking a cigarette and wearing a red scarf, which could potentially be used as a means of identification if SCP-3258 manages to elude containment.

SCP-3258 has shown a mischievous side, enjoying breaking rules and bending boundaries whenever possible. This personality trait has led to some humorous situations during containment. It is advised that personnel interact with SCP-3258 cautiously and monitor their behavior to prevent any further breaches.
