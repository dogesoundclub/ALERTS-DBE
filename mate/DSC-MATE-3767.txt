Item #: 3767

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3767 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times. Any attempt to communicate with or approach the subject should be done with extreme caution. All personnel should wear protective gear and avoid breathing in any gases that may be emitted from the subject's LED gas mask. Any attempts to remove the mask should be considered a high-risk operation and should not be attempted without authorization from Level 4 personnel.

Description: Subject 3767 is a male humanoid of indeterminate age and ethnicity. The subject wears a Doge hat and silver chain, along with a pair of nerd glasses. The most noticeable feature of the subject's face is the presence of multiple spots.

Of particular note is the subject’s LED gas mask, which emits a low-level mist of unknown composition. Further analysis of this mist is ongoing, but initial testing indicates that it may have psychotropic effects on those who breathe it in.

Despite 3756’s intimidating appearance and the Keter classification, the subject exhibits a caring and nurturing personality. They appear to project these tendencies onto inanimate objects, naming their car and speaking to their plants. It is unclear whether this behavior is a sign of a healthy mental state or a manifestation of some underlying psychosis.

As a result of their tendency to anthropomorphize seemingly random objects, it is suspected that 3756 has the ability to enact potent reality-bending effects. However, until further research and analysis are conducted, these abilities are considered theoretical and based solely on conjecture.

It is recommended that all personnel exercise extreme caution when handling this subject, as any attempt to approach the subject may result in the manifestation of anomalous objects or actions. It is strongly advised that no experimentation or testing is conducted without the approval of Level 4 authorization.
