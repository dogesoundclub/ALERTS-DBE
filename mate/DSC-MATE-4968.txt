SCP Foundation Entry 
Item #: SCP-4968
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4968 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a soft floor and a small pile of hay in the corner. SCP-4968 must be provided with a daily ration of carrots, lettuce and apples. A set of enclosed headphones should also be provided to SCP-4968 to regulate its hearing. Clearance Level 2 personnel are permitted to interact with SCP-4968, but must avoid physical contact with the entity.

Description: SCP-4968 is a humanoid entity, standing at 147 cm tall and weighing 34 kg. SCP-4968’s species resembles that of an Oryctolagus cuniculus, with a grey and white fur coat. Two ski goggles serve as SCP-4968’s eyes, and it wears a black hoodie on its head. SCP-4968 is often seen with a silver chain around its neck.

SCP-4968 exhibits a playful but reckless nature. Its impulsive behavior has led to several accidents, both for SCP-4968 and for those around it. Despite its unusual appearance and mischievous nature, SCP-4968 is generally content with its life as a fast-food worker.

Discovery: SCP-4968 was discovered in a Burger King branch in the outskirts of Denver, Colorado. Foundation agents had been tracking anomalous activity in the area and noted several unexplained incidents involving the fast-food restaurant. Upon investigation, SCP-4968 was found in the kitchen, brazenly flipping burgers and singing to itself.

Addendum: SCP-4968 seems to be particularly fond of humans, especially children, and has been observed making costumes and toys for them out of everyday items like napkins and straws. Despite the potential danger of physical contact with SCP-4968, some researchers have argued that it could be used as a covert cross-species liaison. However, other personnel have expressed concerns about the possibility of SCP-4968 causing a security breach or attracting unwanted attention. Further study is needed to clarify the usefulness of SCP-4968 in Foundation operations.
