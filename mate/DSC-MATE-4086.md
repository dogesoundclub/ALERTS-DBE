Item #: 4086

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4086 is to be monitored at all times through the use of surveillance cameras, and all interactions with her are to be carefully monitored for any potential anomalous activity. Due to her profession as a fashion designer, it is essential to prevent her designs from entering the public consciousness, as they seem to have a powerful and unpredictable effect on those who view or wear them. Any clothes or accessories created by subject 4086 are to be confiscated and incinerated immediately.

Description: Subject 4086 is a female human of average height and build, with long black hair and a bright, infectious smile. She is often seen wearing a distinctive jade earring on her right ear and a choker around her neck. Additionally, she is rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. Despite her ordinary appearance, subject 4086 possesses an unusual and powerful gift - the ability to imbue her clothing designs with incredible and unpredictable magical properties.

Personality-wise, subject 4086 is known for her strong sense of duty and responsibility. This sometimes leads her to take on more than she can handle, resulting in some humorous situations. She is often seen carrying an absurd number of bags and purses, juggling fabrics, sketches and other designer equipment. This tendency to overcommit is also reflected in her designs, which frequently incorporate complicated elements, intricate patterns, and hypnotic colors.

On several occasions, subject 4086's creations have had devastating effects on their wearers and viewers, causing sudden changes of personality, hallucinations, and even spontaneous combustion. Her latest line of dresses caused a frenzy among the fashion elite, resulting in a dangerous outbreak of mob violence that resulted in several injuries and one fatality.

It is believed that the anomalous properties of subject 4086's creations are the result of an as yet unknown magical mechanism, which she seems to possess innate control over. Further research into this phenomenon is ongoing.

Addendum: Following Incident 4086-4, in which a group of subjects wearing subject 4086's latest designs caused chaos and mayhem at a high-society ball, a heightened level of vigilance is in place. Efforts are ongoing to locate and retrieve any remaining prototypes of subject 4086's clothing designs, particularly those with strong enchantments, and containment protocols are being updated accordingly.
