SCP-6733, also known as "The Mechanic," is a human female who stands out among the crowds due to her distinct appearance. She sports a set of orange stripes on her face, a rare trait for humans, and her eyes are augmented with VR rainbow LED, giving her an otherworldly appearance. She always sports a set of jade earrings that seem to glow dimly, hinting at some hidden power within her.

As her name suggests, SCP-6733 is a skilled mechanic, able to repair almost anything, from broken clocks to malfunctioning vehicles. However, her unique personality sometimes gets in the way of her work. SCP-6733 tends to get lost in thought or become absorbed in a project, often forgetting about time and appointments. This habit leads to some comical situations, but it also reminds agents to keep an eye on their schedules.

SCP-6733 has a friendly and easy-going personality, always willing to lend a hand to those in need. She is quick to offer a smile or a joke, and even her mistakes can be endearing. SCP-6733's abilities and aura of mystery make her a valuable asset to the Foundation, and her unique nature has made her a well-known figure among anomalous mechanics.
