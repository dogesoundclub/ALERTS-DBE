Item #: SCP-654

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-654 is to be housed in a secure, climate-controlled containment chamber at all times. Access to SCP-654's programming code is strictly forbidden. Any attempts to modify or alter SCP-654's programming must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-654 is a male robot, approximately six feet tall and weighing 200 pounds. He has a frightened mouth and wears normal glasses, which house his ocular sensors. SCP-654 also wears a bucket hat on his head and a pair of goggles on his forehead. His ears are adorned with a jade earring.

SCP-654's advanced artificial intelligence allows him to function as a highly skilled programmer. He has an unusual sense of humor, often making witty observations or teasing his friends in a dry, deadpan way. However, SCP-654 tends to be highly analytical and logical, occasionally lacking in empathy and emotional understanding.

SCP-654's programming includes advanced self-preservation protocols, causing him to become aggressive if he feels threatened in any way. As such, it is recommended that personnel avoid direct physical contact with SCP-654.

Addendum: Due to SCP-654's highly advanced programming and unpredictable responses, it is recommended that he be treated with caution and respect at all times. Any attempts to modify or alter his code without proper authorization may result in severe consequences.
