Item #: SCP-4673

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4673 is to be contained in a designated compartment within Site-███. SCP-4673 is allowed to operate as a train driver on the agreed-upon schedule, under the close supervision of Foundation agents. The containment chamber of SCP-4673 is to be routinely checked for any signs of tampering or breaches.

Description: SCP-4673 appears as a male Bengal tiger dressed in human clothing, topped with a blue bandana as headwear, with a pair of goggles resting on his forehead. SCP-4673's ears are adorned with a green jade earring, a gold chain around its neck, and always has a candy stick in its hand/paw. They possess an anomalous ability to transform into a train engine, complete with train horns, whistles, and engines, whenever they hear the sound of train tracks at work.

SCP-4673 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, as a transport train driver. They tend to excel in their job, dedicating their time and energy to fulfill their daily schedule. SCP-4673 can be classified as hardworking, determined, but with occasional quirkiness, making it endearing to their human counterparts. Despite their efforts, SCP-4673 can sometimes take on more than they can handle, leading to errors in schedules or overloading with its duties.

SCP-4673's transformation is not entirely controllable and can occur randomly when the train sound reaches its ears. During transformation, SCP-4673 can move at tremendous speeds, rivaling that of the fastest recorded land transport speeds. SCP-4673 has been known to use this ability to its advantage in complex situations, such as track diversions or immediate evacuation of passengers, highlighting its potential use for the Foundation.

SCP-4673 displays no aggressive or harmful behavior in its human form or during transformations. The experiment has shown no signs of anomalous abilities apart from its transportation capabilities.

Addendum 1: SCP-4673 is allowed to operate as a train driver but is forbidden from engaging in any conversations with passengers or unauthorized personnel. In the situation where SCP-4673 goes rogue or is breached, containment agents must deploy specialized tranquilizers or magnetic traps to immobilize SCP-4673 for retrieval.
