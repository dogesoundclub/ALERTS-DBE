Item #: SCP-1466

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1466 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Personnel must wear Level 2 hazmat suits when interacting with SCP-1466, particularly when receiving any of its beautician services, to prevent any potential anomalous effects. Any objects or materials used on SCP-1466 must be thoroughly inspected before and after use, and any possible contamination must be contained and studied.

Description: SCP-1466 is a human female with multiple spots on her face arranged in a random pattern, paired with bright orange eyebrows and red lipstick, giving it a distinct and unusual appearance. SCP-1466 usually wears a hoodie with a silver chain around her neck and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

SCP-1466 is a skilled beautician who demonstrates exceptional organizational and strategic thinking abilities. It is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented, often taking on tasks beyond its capacity, but it usually manages to complete them successfully. SCP-1466's services result in unusual and often anomalous beauty effects. These effects include color changes of nails, hair, and skin, as well as the manipulation of their shape and texture. SCP-1466's beautician services have an unusual effect on subjects, bringing out their deepest and darkest desires.

SCP-1466's anomalous properties have made it an asset to the Foundation, enabling it to gather valuable intelligence through its interactions with subjects. However, as its effects can be unpredictable, procedures must be in place to contain any potential contamination of the surrounding environment. SCP-1466 is cooperative and responsive to direction, but caution must be exercised when interacting with it to avoid any potential unwanted effects.

Addendum: SCP-1466 has requested permission to use its beautician skills on Foundation personnel as a form of therapy. A request denied by O5 council. Any personnel expressing an interest in receiving SCP-1466's services will be reassigned to a less anomalous field of work.
