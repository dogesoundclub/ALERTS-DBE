SCP-6527, nicknamed "Doc", is a highly skilled veterinarian with an unusual feature - he is a tiger. He possesses a Jade LED display on his strikingly bright eyes, and his headset is embellished with LED lights. Doc can often be seen sporting a silver chain, which he wears as a symbol of his authority.

Despite his intimidating appearance, SCP-6527 is a highly amiable and approachable individual. He possesses a dry wit that takes people off their guard, and his deadpan jokes can often amuse even the hardest skeptic. Doc is extremely gifted in his profession, and his patients regard him with high esteem.

During his leisure time, SCP-6527 enjoys reading books and taking long walks in the forest, where he is most relaxed. Doc is also an accomplished cook, and his skills in the kitchen are highly sought after by his friends.

However, caution is advised when in the presence of SCP-6527. Though he is cordial and friendly, his fierce nature as a tiger cannot be ignored. In the event of an altercation, he can and will defend himself with lethal precision.

All interactions with SCP-6527 must be conducted with caution, and all personnel must be accompanied by a security detail.
