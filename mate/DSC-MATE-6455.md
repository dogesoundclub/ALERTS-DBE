Description: DSC-MATE-6455 is a male monkey with shade glasses, a police cap, and a red scarf. DSC-MATE-6455's notable feature is the jade earring it wears on its left ear. DSC-MATE-6455 identifies itself as a news anchor and has a strong sense of independence. It is capable of sophisticated language use and has demonstrated an extensive knowledge of current events.

DSC-MATE-6455 has a stubborn streak and will sometimes refuse to accept assistance, despite overwhelming evidence that it is needed. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as DSC-MATE-6455 trying to move heavy objects by itself or insisting it does not need a map when lost. DSC-MATE-6455 appears to be unaware of its own limitations and is prone to overestimating its abilities.

DSC-MATE-6455 was first discovered after an incident in which it hijacked a live news broadcast to deliver a fake news story. Mobile Task Force Lambda-4 was deployed to locate DSC-MATE-6455 and take it into Foundation custody. During the operation, DSC-MATE-6455 displayed a remarkable ability to evade capture, leading to the conclusion that it is highly intelligent and resourceful.

Addendum: Due to complaints from DSC-MATE-6455 regarding its confinement, it has been provided with a small television set that shows live news broadcasts. DSC-MATE-6455 appears to be content with this arrangement and has demonstrated improved cooperation with Foundation personnel. Monitoring of DSC-MATE-6455's behavior is ongoing.
