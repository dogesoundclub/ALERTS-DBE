SCP-5393, also known as "The Reckless Doctor," is a human female of unknown origin. Her appearance is characterized by orange stripes on her face and orange eyebrows, accompanied by a hoodie as well as a medical mask that covers her mouth. SCP-5393 can commonly be found wearing a gold chain around her neck as an accessory.

SCP-5393 has a dangerous personality trait of being highly spontaneous, and her actions can lead her to make impulsive decisions. She displays a tendency for risk-taking and may jump off cliffs into bodies of water without considering the consequences.

SCP-5393 now serves as a Medical Officer at Site-██ to utilize her medical expertise in the medical department. She has been known to cause trouble for the Site Security as well as Medical Staff due to her reckless behavior, but with proper supervision, SCP-5393 proves to be a valuable asset to the Foundation. Therefore, extreme caution is advised when interacting with SCP-5393.
