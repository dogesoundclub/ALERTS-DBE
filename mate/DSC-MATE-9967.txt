Item #: SCP-9967

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9967 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be outfitted with a reinforced stage and audio equipment to support SCP-9967's theatrical work. SCP-9967 is allowed to leave their cell for scheduled performances and must be accompanied by at least two Level 3 personnel. Due to SCP-9967's tendency for lighthearted antics, containment personnel must be trained in de-escalation tactics and have a sense of humor.

Description: SCP-9967 is a human female identified as a theater manager, assigned the number 9967 by the Foundation. SCP-9967 has orange stripes on their face, and their green head features an edge curl. Their eyes have orange eyebrows and their ears are adorned with jade earrings. SCP-9967 often wears a silver chain and an LED gas mask accessory.

SCP-9967 possesses a strong sense of duty and an acute sense of responsibility when it comes to their work. However, they also have a playful and humorous personality, which can be misinterpreted as a lack of seriousness. SCP-9967 is known for their spontaneous dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor, particularly at social events.

SCP-9967's theatrical work is exceptional, and they are considered one of the best in their field. They possess a seemingly innate ability to influence the emotions of an audience, whether through humor or drama. However, SCP-9967's performances have also been known to cause unexpected emotional outbursts in some individuals in the audience.

Analysis of SCP-9967's abilities and behavior suggests that they may possess anomalous abilities related to emotional manipulation. Further study is ongoing.

Addendum: During a recent performance, SCP-9967 experienced a sudden emotional outburst, resulting in the manifestation of an anomalous entity. The entity, designated SCP-9967-1, was contained and is currently undergoing research. Investigation into the cause of SCP-9967's outburst is ongoing.
