Item #: DSC-MATE-6587

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6587 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be treated as a Class B Safe entity and given access to basic office supplies and communication devices. Access to the internet is restricted and monitored. Any instances of DSC-MATE-6587 attempting to divulge information that may compromise the existence of the Foundation or other anomalous entities are to be reported immediately to on-site security personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-6587 is a female human identified as a reporter for [REDACTED] news agency. It is approximately 29 years old, stands at 1.67 meters in height and has a weight of 63.5 kilograms. DSC-MATE-6587's physical appearance is distinctive, with blonde hair and an unknown avian wing protruding from its scalp. Its eyes are a bright orange hue, and its eyebrows are shaped like wings. DSC-MATE-6587 also has a red cross earring and a gold chain.

Whenever DSC-MATE-6587 is in close proximity to other entities, its natural charm and charisma can make it the life of the party. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as telling jokes or doing silly dances to make others laugh. DSC-MATE-6587's personality has proven to be quite useful in acquiring information and gathering data. However, it initially resisted Foundation custody and claimed to have information that could be used to expose the existence of anomalous entities to the general public.

DSC-MATE-6587 claims to have no knowledge of the origin or nature of its wing, but it has expressed an interest in researching further into the matter. It has also expressed frustration with the normal gas mask that it wears at all times, which it claims obstructs its sense of smell and interferes with its ability to gather information.

Addendum: Due to DSC-MATE-6587's potential for leaking sensitive information, it is to be monitored closely, and all communication devices are to be strictly controlled. Any attempts at unauthorized communication or access to the internet are to be reported immediately.
