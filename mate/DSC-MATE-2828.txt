Item #: 2828

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2828 is to be contained in a Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber at Site-██. The room must contain a minimum of 15m x 15m space for safe mobility. SCP-2828's chamber must also be equipped with a high-performance air filtration system to remove odors and contaminants from the air.

SCP-2828 must receive daily psychological therapy sessions to maintain its emotional stability and help understand its role and responsibility as a member of the SCP Foundation. SCP-2828 must also have access to a nearby gymnasium for regular exercise, as well as a diet tailored to its species' needs.

SCP-2828 may only be granted permission to leave the containment chamber under supervision for the purpose of assigned research or during Site-██’s emergency protocols.

Description: SCP-2828 is a male Bengal Tiger of approximately seven years old with a height of 1.8 meters and weight of 227 kg. SCP-2828’s eyes resemble ski goggles, and its mouth feature permanently carries a frightened expression. SCP-2828 has green hair and a purple cap on its head. It also wears a medical mask and a gold chain as an accessory.

Despite being a tiger, SCP-2828 has shown human-like behavior and cognitive abilities. SCP-2828 can communicate in English fluently and understands standard Foundation communication protocol. SCP-2828 possesses a love for adventure, taking risks, or trying new things at times which can lead to humorous stories. However, this curiosity has shown to have caused some mishaps, such as narrowly surviving a bungee jumping event and wandering off into the wilderness unknowingly.

SCP-2828 was first discovered when reports of a “talking tiger” began circulating among the public. Agents were quickly dispatched to secure the entity and SCP-2828 was transferred to Foundation custody.

Addendum: Though SCP-2828 expresses a willingness to work for the Foundation, its carefree personality may lead to dangerous situations. The Ethics Committee is currently debating whether to permit SCP-2828 to be assigned to more dangerous positions in the Foundation or keep it in its current role as a Site security guard.
