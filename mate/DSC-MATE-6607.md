Item #: DSC-MATE-6607

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6607 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. DSC-MATE-6607's medical mask is to remain intact at all times to avoid exposure of instances of DSC-MATE-6607-1. Interaction with DSC-MATE-6607 requires prior approval from at least one level 3 personnel. 

Description: DSC-MATE-6607 resembles a human female with brown hair styled in a 90s fashion. Apart from the anomalous traits, DSC-MATE-6607 does not display any physically abnormal characteristics. DSC-MATE-6607's face bears hallmarks of the "clown" appearance, including red clown eyes, red lipstick, and two spots on her left cheek. The forehead of DSC-MATE-6607 bears a two-color band tattooed across it, and her ears have green cross earrings. DSC-MATE-6607 is often seen wearing a gold chain.

DSC-MATE-6607's personality is commanding and assertive, often leading to her appearing intimidating to those around her. However, she merely seeks the most efficient and effective means of accomplishing tasks. DSC-MATE-6607 is a skilled mechanic but cannot work with any bio-mechanic contraptions.

DSC-MATE-6607's mask is to remain permanently affixed to prevent the spread of DSC-MATE-6607-1. DSC-MATE-6607 can emit a contagious gas within its breath which causes its subject to laugh uncontrollably. The gas would spread through the air, infecting those in its immediate vicinity.

DSC-MATE-6607-1 instances are individuals who breathed in DSC-MATE-6607's contagious gas. The laughing effect would last up to twelve hours, during which subjects would display a lack of normal bodily control and coordination, which can lead to falls and resulting injuries. DSC-MATE-6607-1 instances have shown to be addicted to the effect, and studies indicate that there is a possibility to refine the chemical. However, tests are pending approval. 

Recovery Log: DSC-MATE-6607 was initially found in ██████, Boston, on the 23rd of October 1990, following reports of multiple instances of out-of-control laughter. Foundation operatives on sight encountered DSC-MATE-6607 amongst a group showing signs of DSC-MATE-6607-1 infections. Following initial containment, a full investigation was conducted to confirm DSC-MATE-6607's anomalous nature and appropriate containment protocols. 

Addendum 6607-A: Following a containment breach on ██/██/2021, when DSC-MATE-6607-1 instances got into Site-██, containment involving DSC-MATE-6607 was tightened. DSC-MATE-6607's mechanical skills were utilized to create and install additional security measures, significantly reducing the chances of future breaches.
