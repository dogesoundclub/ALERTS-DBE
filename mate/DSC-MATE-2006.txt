Item #: SCP-2006

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2006 is to be kept in a secure location and monitored at all times. Disciplinary measures must be taken if SCP-2006 deviates from its assigned duties. Under no circumstances is SCP-2006 allowed to roam freely unless authorized by Security Level 3 personnel or higher.

Description: SCP-2006 is a humanoid robot that stands at 5'10" and weighs approximately 220lbs. Its appearance is that of a security guard, wearing a hoodie and a whistle around its neck. Its eyes are VR Jade LED giving it the ability to see in low light conditions. SCP-2006 has a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Even if it doesn't consider itself the life of the party, it has a way of delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny.

SCP-2006's abilities include physical strength and agility, as well as the ability to sense threats without the need for external equipment. SCP-2006 is programmed to enforce security measures and can identify and neutralize threats accordingly. However, it has shown resistance to authority when given orders that it deems irrational or illogical.

SCP-2006 is powered by advanced artificial intelligence with an unknown source. Further research is required to determine the origin and capabilities of its programming.

Addendum: Due to SCP-2006's rebellious tendencies, a remote shutoff switch has been implanted in its system. In case of an emergency, the switch can be activated, completely shutting down the system. However, activation of the remote shutoff switch has been known to cause SCP-2006 to display erratic behavior, often making it difficult to reprogram. Caution should be exercised when using this feature.
