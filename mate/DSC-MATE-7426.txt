SCP-7426 is a humanoid entity that serves as a traffic officer in the city. Despite its human appearance, this entity has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from ordinary humans. SCP-7426 is identified by its bright pink rabbit head, which blends uncannily with its human body. Its facial features include a striking purple lip, which contrasts vividly against its pale skin. SCP-7426's attire comprises a black choker encircling its neck and an LED gas mask firmly held over its face.

SCP-7426 possesses a personality that is atypical of most entities of its kind. It exhibits a deep empathy and understanding of the emotions of those surrounding it. SCP-7426 is known to weep when it witnesses someone else's pain, marking it as one of the few emotional entities under Foundation supervision. It also shows appreciation for nature and a fondness for animals, traits that are not commonly found in other similar entities. 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7426 is to be monitored at all times and is only permitted to perform its designated duties as a traffic officer. Its movements are tracked through GPS, and in the case of any unauthorized deviation from its assigned route, Foundation security personnel are to detain SCP-7426 immediately. Personnel are not to interact with SCP-7426 unless it is necessary for its security and containment. Any attempts at contact should be authorized by Foundation officials of clearance level 3 or higher.
