Item #: 373

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 373, also known as the "Beautician," is to be kept in a standard human containment cell at Site-██. Subject is allowed access to personal grooming items and beauty treatments upon request, and is monitored at all times for any unusual behavior.

Description: Subject 373 is a male human with distinctive spots on their face, coupled with a perpetual frightened expression on their mouth. The subject's most notable feature is their red clown eyes, which are highly unusual and appear to hold an inexplicable power over those who meet their gaze. The subject wears a hoodie and is often seen with a silver chain around their neck and a cigarette in their hand.

Subject 373 is known for their highly charismatic personality and ability to connect with others on a deep level. They possess a keen sense of humor and often utilize it to put others at ease or develop close relationships. Subject has been observed to elicit personal information and life stories from complete strangers, often leaving them feeling a sense of closeness and familiarity.

The exact nature of the subject's abilities is unknown, but their presence has been known to induce a feeling of "tightness" in the chest of those around them. Some staff members have reported experiencing feelings of anxiety or fear when in the presence of the Beautician, although this effect is not universal.

Addendum: Further study is required to determine the full extent of Subject 373's abilities and whether they pose a potential threat to Foundation personnel or the general population. Subject's cooperation is recommended for further research.
