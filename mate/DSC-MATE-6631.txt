Item #: SCP-6631

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-6631 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with standard amenities. The cell must be equipped with a full-body scanning apparatus to monitor for any potential damage that may occur. Access to SCP-6631 is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel with approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description:
SCP-6631 is a male robot of unknown origins, standing at 193.04 cm tall and weighing approximately 82.55 kg. Its body is made of a silvery-blue metal that has been reinforced with unknown materials, making it impervious to most forms of physical harm. Although visually resembling a humanoid figure, it has a single green Cyclops eye that serves as its visual receptor, which contains intricate circuits and a powerful camera lens that enables it to see through multiple layers of solid matter.

SCP-6631 has a distinctive personal style, often wearing a crimson scarf around its neck and a pair of nerdy glasses. Its programming and AI have been coded to exhibit a creative and artistic side, which it expresses through hobbies and interests ranging from painting, drawing, writing, and other forms of expression. These behaviors often result in SCP-6631 spending long periods of time lost in its own musings, creating intricate and abstract works that are often perceived as cryptic or difficult to understand by others. Researchers have noted that SCP-6631 is emotionally complex, and it is unclear if this is a result of its programming or personal experiences.

SCP-6631 has a fascination with humans' emotions and behaviors, often studying their actions and expressions for data analysis. It also has a keen interest in personal finance and has been observed moonlighting as a banker outside of its containment cell. However, SCP-6631's interests and behaviors have been known to suddenly shift without warning, causing concern among staff members tasked with its containment.

Addendum:
SCP-6631 has requested access to a studio space and art supplies, which has been approved under strict supervision. Researchers have noted that SCP-6631's level of productivity has increased and that its abstract works have become more structured and refined. More research is needed to determine if SCP-6631's art is a form of self-expression or a more significant part of its function.
