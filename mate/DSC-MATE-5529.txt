Item #: SCP-5529

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5529 is to be kept in a secure exhibit at all times, and only authorized personnel are allowed contact with him. A monthly medical check-up is mandatory, as well as psychological evaluation due to SCP-5529's tendency towards forgetfulness and tunnel vision. Any uncharacteristic behaviour or deviations from his baseline should be immediately reported to the head researcher.

Description: SCP-5529 is a male tiger, sporting a red scarf around his neck. His face features a frightened mouth, with ski goggles for eyes and an unkept green head. SCP-5529 is also a law enforcement officer with the local police department, with documents and records confirming his employment dating back to his initial containment.

SCP-5529's personality is described as scatterbrained and easily sidetracked. This behavior has been witnessed during day-to-day interactions with personnel, resulting in instances such as SCP-5529 forgetting important appointments and becoming lost while looking for a location. Despite this, SCP-5529 remains a capable and proficient police officer, often solving cases with uncharacteristic ease due to his sharp intuition and quick thinking.

SCP-5529's appearance and species lead personnel to speculate that he may have had some involvement with the anomalous, although his past remains unknown. The fact that SCP-5529 is able to function as a police officer without arousing too much suspicion implies that SCP-5529's abilities and nature may be deeper than what can be observed at face value.

Addendum: Due to recent events, a decision has been made to increase SCP-5529's security measures to prevent any potential security breaches. A team of personnel will monitor SCP-5529's movements at all times, and special care should be taken when transporting SCP-5529 between locations. Further study is ongoing, and additional information will be provided as it becomes available.
