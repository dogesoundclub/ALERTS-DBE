Item #: 5422

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5422 is to be kept in a secure storage unit located in Site-19. The unit must be equipped with a power source that can provide enough energy to keep the item in operational mode. Personnel are not allowed to interact with 5422 without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: Item 5422 is a traffic officer robot designed to patrol and regulate vehicle flow in urban areas. Its body is made of reinforced metal and equipped with multiple sensors that allow it to detect and analyze traffic patterns. Its most notable feature is its green cyclops-like eye, which serves as the primary visual input for the robot.

In addition to its traffic management duties, 5422 has been programmed to display personality traits and emotions similar to those of human beings. Item 5422 is equipped with nerd glasses, a Doge hat, and a gold earring in its right ear. It also wears a gold chain around its neck and smokes a cigarette whenever it is not on active duty.

The personality of 5422 is defined by a strong sense of independence, making it reluctant to ask for help even when it is needed. It has been observed engaging in humorous situations, including trying to move heavy furniture on its own or refusing to use a map when lost.

In tests, 5422 has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability in dealing with unexpected situations, suggesting that it has been programmed with a primitive form of problem-solving ability. However, care must be taken when interacting with Item 5422, as it may become unpredictable if it feels threatened or cornered.

Addendum: Due to the potential risks involved in interacting with 5422, testing and study of the item are to be conducted only by personnel with extensive experience in robotics and AI. Further research on 5422's programming and development is ongoing.
