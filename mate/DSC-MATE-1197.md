Description: DSC-MATE-1197 is a male rabbit with the ability to take on the form of a human. As a human, DSC-MATE-1197 manifests as the theater manager of [REDACTED], a local theater which is used as a front for Foundation operations in the area.

DSC-MATE-1197's physical appearance when in human form includes a police cap, normal glasses, a red scarf, and a gas mask.
