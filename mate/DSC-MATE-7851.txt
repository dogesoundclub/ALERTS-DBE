Item #: SCP-7851

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7851 is to be kept inside a standard containment locker when not undergoing testing or interacting with staff. SCP-7851 must always wear its LED gas mask to protect against potential exposure to hazardous material. All interaction must be done through visual communication due to SCP-7851's speaking ability. Any incident of memory loss or absent-mindedness should be immediately reported to the on-duty staff.

Description: SCP-7851 is a male rabbit approximately 25 cm in height. SCP-7851's physical appearance is altered due to the various accessories it wears, such as a doge hat, gold earring, and red scarf. SCP-7851 also wears nerd glasses and has a two-color band on its forehead. SCP-7851's mouth is often in a permanent state of fright. 

SCP-7851 is a professional beautician and is known for its skills in grooming and styling. However, SCP-7851 often displays absent-mindedness and forgetfulness which can hinder its performance. SCP-7851's capability for speech has been limited, and verbal communication results in indecipherable mumbling. SCP-7851 primarily communicates through written notes and gestures.

SCP-7851 has a passive nature and maintains a docile demeanor unless provoked. However, SCP-7851's forgetfulness and tendency to get lost in thought can lead to mischievous behavior such as forgetting appointments or misplacing objects. 

It is important to note that SCP-7851 is highly susceptible to suggestion and can be swayed easily by those it trusts. Therefore, interaction with SCP-7851 should be kept to a minimal level and monitored constantly.

Addendum: On occasion, SCP-7851 has displayed an anomalous ability to transform and morph into different hairstyles and colors. Testing is ongoing to understand the nature and limits of this ability.
