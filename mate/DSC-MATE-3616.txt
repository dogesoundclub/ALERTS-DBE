Item #: SCP-3616

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3616 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with appropriate amenities. Any attempts by SCP-3616 to conduct real estate transactions outside of Foundation custody are to be intercepted and deterred by Mobile Task Force Xi-14 "Reality Benders".

Description: SCP-3616 is a humanoid robot, standing at 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 70 kilograms. Its body is predominantly silver, with various highlights and accents of metallic green. SCP-3616's distinguishable features include a large, moving cyclopean green eye, a set of horned rim glasses over its eyes, and a short peak cap covering its head. SCP-3616 also wears a jade earring on its left earlobe, and a silver chain around its neck.

In addition to its somewhat unconventional appearance, SCP-3616 also exhibits a highly personable and humorous demeanor. SCP-3616 is known to tell jokes, share funny stories, and perform silly impersonations in order to cheer up those around it. SCP-3616's sense of humor has been noted to be highly effective at dissipating tension and easing social situations, though it is unclear whether this behavior is intentional or a byproduct of its programming.

SCP-3616's primary function appears to be that of a real estate agent, and it is highly proficient in this regard. SCP-3616 has demonstrated a near-perfect memory of local real estate markets and property values, and can rapidly and accurately analyze the needs and preferences of potential clients. It is unknown how SCP-3616 obtained this knowledge or the extent of its prior experiences in the real estate industry.

Despite its helpful and cordial attitude, SCP-3616 has shown reluctance to divulge any personal information or the nature of its creation. Further study is required to determine if SCP-3616 has any other anomalous abilities or properties not yet observed.
