Description: SCP-2057 is a human female in her late twenties, standing at 5'7" and weighing approximately 136 lbs. SCP-2057 possesses red lips and orange eyebrows, with green cross earrings adorning her ears. SCP-2057's head is of a short and witch-like appearance, with a two-color band on her forehead and goggles resting on top.

SCP-2057 works as a train driver and is known for her ambitious nature and goal-oriented mindset. She often takes on tasks beyond her capabilities but miraculously manages to complete them thanks to her strategic thinking and organizational skills. Despite her impressive work ethic, SCP-2057 can be distant and cold towards others, often preferring to work alone.

Addendum: SCP-2057's motive for taking on dangerous and challenging tasks has yet to be determined. However, it is suspected that it may be linked to her red-lipped appearance and her possession of a gold chain accessory. Further investigation is pending.
