Item #: 1360

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1360 is to be monitored at all times and is to be contained in a specialized enclosure at Site-██. Handlers are advised to remain cautious around SCP-1360 as it has shown signs of intelligence and may attempt to escape if given the opportunity. Additionally, Level 3 clearance is required for any interactions with SCP-1360.

Description: SCP-1360 appears to be a male Monkey, standing at approximately 4 feet tall. It wears normal glasses and is often seen wearing a Doge hat along with a gold chain and carrying a candy stick. SCP-1360 possesses highly advanced cognitive abilities beyond that of a typical monkey, with an IQ of approximately 150. It has also demonstrated a remarkable ability to use complex tools and solve problems, often using its highly analytical and logical personality to devise original solutions.

Despite its impressive intellect, SCP-1360 can be highly argumentative and enjoys engaging in debates with others. This can lead to humorous situations, where SCP-1360 vehemently argues about mundane topics that others find unimportant. Nonetheless, SCP-1360's debating skills have been invaluable in the Foundation when it is needed to solve challenging problems.

SCP-1360 was discovered working as a real estate agent in ██████, and was eventually taken into custody by the Foundation after bystanders reported it talking in a complex language and using tools like a human. The origin and cause of SCP-1360's remarkable abilities remain unknown.

Addendum: Notes from Handler Dr. ██

SCP-1360 is one of the most intelligent creatures we have ever encountered. It is capable of giving us insights into our most challenging problems, and we have learned to appreciate its unique brand of humor. That being said, its argumentative nature can be exhausting, and we must always keep a close watch on it. SCP-1360 may seem like a funny and harmless monkey, but never let your guard down—unpredictable and dangerous may be more accurate descriptors for SCP-1360.
