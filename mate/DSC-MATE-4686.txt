Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4686 is to be housed in a standard human containment unit, consisting of a furnished apartment with a small garden for their personal use. All personal items belonging to SCP-4686 are to be inspected for possible anomalous properties before being allowed into the containment area. Any items deemed anomalous are to be confiscated and stored in appropriate containment units.

SCP-4686 is required to work as a veterinarian at a local animal hospital. All interactions with SCP-4686 are to be recorded and monitored. Any abnormal behavior or interactions with animals are to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-4686 is a female human of average height and weight. They have distinctive orange stripes on their cheeks, and their lips are colored red. Their eyes have orange eyebrows, and their head has been dyed in a shade of orange.

SCP-4686 consistently wears a black choker around their neck, which appears to have no anomalous properties. They also wear a modern LED gas mask over their mouth and nose, which acts as a filter to purify the air.

SCP-4686 is a caring and nurturing individual who has an affinity for all types of living and non-living things. They tend to anthropomorphize everything in their life, from their car to their household appliances. SCP-4686 refers to their car as "Betsy" and talks to their plants daily, even going as far as to play music to them to keep them happy.

Addendum: Addendum 4686-1: SCP-4686's work as a veterinarian has proven to be beneficial in containing and studying anomalous animal entities. SCP-4686's compassionate nature and understanding of animals have aided in calming aberrant creatures down, which has made their capture easier in the field. SCP-4686's ability to connect with animals is of great interest to the Foundation's research department.
