Item #: 8052

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8052 is to be monitored for any anomalous activity but is otherwise allowed to live a normal life as a fast food worker. Due to the nature of their face and head features, they are to be required to wear a hat and a face mask at all times while on the job.

Description: SCP-8052 is a humanoid individual of the species Homo Sapiens with the appearance of a young adult male. They stand at approximately 5'10" tall and weigh around 155 lbs. Their face features a distinct mouth spot and a smile with nerd glasses resting on their nose. SCP-8052's head is crowned with a bright green and black mohawk, and they possess a two-color band across their forehead.

One of SCP-8052's distinguishing traits is their affinity for cigarettes, but there are no known detrimental effects on their health. SCP-8052 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility within their workspace, earning them high praise from their managers and colleagues. However, they are also known for letting loose and having fun, often surprising others with their dance moves and antics on socializing events.

SCP-8052 has not developed any known anomalous abilities, but they remain under observation for any potential changes in behavior or physical appearance.

Addendum:

SCP-8052 has expressed a desire to start a band with fellow anomalous beings, and the proposal is currently under review by the Foundation. Cooperation with SCP-8052 in this endeavor may be beneficial for both parties.
