Special Containment Procedures: Subject 177 is to be monitored via her news station, with strict orders to refrain from discussing any sensitive information to the general public. All interviews, footage, and broadcasts are to be heavily filtered for any signs of abnormal behavior. She must be closely watched for any tendencies related to her predictive abilities.

Description: Subject 177, also known as the News Anchor, is a female human of unknown age. She wears a retro cap on her head and a medical mask over her mouth, making it difficult to discern her true appearance. Her unique facial features include red clown eyes and spots that cover her face. There is a 2-color band on her forehead, and she wears a choker around her neck.

Subject 177 possesses a remarkable sense of intuition, allowing her to predict events before they occur. This ability borders on seemingly psychic powers, making her one of the most enigmatic humans observed. Her skills extend beyond predicting events and into the realm of emotional perception. She can sense the emotions of those around her, making it difficult for people to hide their true feelings from her. This ability can be unnerving, often leaving those around her uncomfortable.

Despite her unusual abilities, Subject 177 demonstrates a professional and composed demeanor both on and off the air. She is well-spoken and charismatic, with an infectious personality that captures the attention of her audience.

Additional Notes: Further study is required to fully understand the extent of Subject 177's abilities. She has been known to predict natural disasters, crimes, and other occurrences before they happen. There are rumors of her involvement in the supernatural realm, although this has yet to be confirmed. For now, Subject 177 poses no immediate threat and is considered a valuable asset to the Foundationâ€™s network.
