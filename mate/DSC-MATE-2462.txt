Item #: SCP-2462

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2462 is to be monitored at all times via security cameras and audio devices, and is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with appropriate ventilation systems for use with the gas mask worn by the subject. SCP-2462 is to be allowed access to an outside area for daily exercise and patrols, but must be accompanied by at least two armed guards while on duty. Any attempts by SCP-2462 to use their authority as a traffic officer to gain access to restricted areas or materials are to be reported immediately to superiors.

Description: SCP-2462 is a female humanoid of average size, with a distinctive pink rabbit head and orange stripes on her face. SCP-2462's forehead features two evenly-spaced color bands, and her ears are adorned with a green cross earring. SCP-2462 often wears a standard traffic officer uniform, along with a gold chain and a normal gas mask, which it wears at all times.

SCP-2462's personality is characterized by recklessness and impulsiveness. The subject has a tendency to act before thinking things through, which often leads to comical mishaps and accidents. SCP-2462's desire to impress others can sometimes place them in harm's way or lead to the misuse of their authority as a traffic officer.

SCP-2462 possesses a unique ability to control and manipulate vehicles within a 50-meter radius, though this ability appears to be uncontrollable and unintentional. The exact nature and origin of this anomalous ability are unknown.

Addendum: Recent observations suggest that SCP-2462's reckless behavior may be escalating, particularly in situations involving physical confrontation. It is recommended that additional security precautions be implemented around the subject, and that regular psychological evaluations be conducted to monitor for signs of instability.
