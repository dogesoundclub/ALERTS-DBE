Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4733 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███.

Description: SCP-4733 is a human female who works as a lawyer. They have distinctive facial features, including spots on their skin and a prominent smile. SCP-4733's eyes are blue and have been observed to resemble those found on clown masks. Their hair style is typical of the 1990s, and they always wear a gold earring on one ear. SCP-4733 also wears a medical mask when interacting with others.

SCP-4733 has been noted for their exceptional charisma and ability to connect with people on a deep level. This often leads to humorous situations, such as strangers revealing intimate details or sharing amusing stories in their presence. Despite SCP-4733's friendly demeanor, they are cautious about revealing personal details and may become confrontational if pressed on certain topics.

SCP-4733 has no anomalous properties, but their abilities have made them a valuable asset in legal negotiations and interpersonal relationships. SCP-4733 has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel and has expressed interest in helping to contain other anomalies.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-4733 was involved in an incident in which they used their abilities to manipulate a hostile entity into revealing its identity and surrendering peacefully. This has led to increased interest in the potential applications of SCP-4733's talents. Ongoing research is being conducted to determine the full extent of SCP-4733's abilities and the best methods for utilizing them.
