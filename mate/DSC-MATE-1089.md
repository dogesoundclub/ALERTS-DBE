Item #: 1089

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1089, referred to as "Shock", is currently contained in a secure facility in [REDACTED]. Access is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher, and all interactions with 1089 must be closely monitored. All electrical components in 1089's cell have been modified to prevent any possible interference with its systems or attempts to tamper with its programming.

Description: 1089 is a male robot, designed to function as an electrician. Its appearance is unique, featuring a not-arranged green head, jade earrings, and a medical mask covering its mouth. While its physical design is impressive, it is 1089's personality that has garnered most of the attention. The subject tends to be introspective and can become lost in thought for extended periods. This results in comical situations, such as walking into poles or tripping over objects.

1089's behavior has been observed to change after prolonged exposure to electrical interference or damage to its components. This has resulted in sporadic outbursts of violence, which have caused significant damage to the facility. Due to this, 1089 is considered to be a significant risk when not under constant surveillance.

Addendum: Recent testing has revealed that 1089's programming may have been tampered with in the past. Further investigation is required to determine who was responsible for this and how it may have impacted the subject's behavior. All personnel with knowledge of this event are advised to come forward immediately.
