Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8866 is to be monitored at all times in case of potential emotional outbursts. Personnel must approach with caution and utilize emotional support techniques to prevent triggering any negative emotional reactions.

Description: SCP-8866 is a human male with blue clown eyes and a retro cap. SCP-8866 is often seen wearing a medical mask and gold earring, with a gold chain being his accessory of choice. SCP-8866's most notable feature is his infectious smile, which is often accompanied by a bright and positive demeanor.

SCP-8866 is a firefighter whose deep empathy and understanding for others make him valuable in crisis situations. However, SCP-8866 may become emotional and moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing someone else's pain or suffering. SCP-8866 has a strong attachment to animals and nature, and often requests permission to interact with any animals found on site.

SCP-8866's emotional instability makes him a potential risk to containment, as his emotional outbursts can create hazardous situations. Outside of his emotional instability, SCP-8866's abilities as a firefighter make him an asset to any team. 

Note: SCP-8866's emotional state can be controlled through the use of calming techniques and emotional support. SCP-8866 is not to be treated as a threat, but rather a valuable addition to the Foundation's roster.
