Item #: DSC-MATE-4083

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4083 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The subject is allowed access to basic tools and mechanical equipment for the purposes of maintaining and repairing Foundation vehicles, but must be supervised by at least two armed guards at all times. The subject is not to be allowed any communication with non-Foundation personnel except for designated interrogators.

Description: DSC-MATE-4083 is a male human of average height and build. The subject displays distinctive orange stripes on his face, which are presumed to be a natural pigment mutation. DSC-MATE-4083 wears a purple cap with a headset, and is often seen smoking a cigarette. The subject wears normal glasses, but has a two color band on his forehead and a silver chain around his neck.

DSC-MATE-4083's personality is what sets him apart from regular humans. The subject has an extremely empathetic and compassionate nature, which seems to be amplified by his orange stripes. This often leads him to take on other people's problems as his own, and he feels responsible for fixing everything and everyone around him. DSC-MATE-4083's tireless efforts to fix and maintain Foundation vehicles has earned him the nickname "The Mechanic", and his services are highly valued by Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-4083 has not exhibited any anomalous abilities or tendencies, other than his compassionate personality. However, the subject's constant need to help others can sometimes lead to exhaustion and burnout. DSC-MATE-4083 has been known to become agitated and even physically aggressive when he feels that he is unable to help someone in need.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4083 has shown a remarkable ability to sense when a vehicle is in need of repair, even when no mechanical issues are evident. Foundation engineers have been unsuccessful in determining the source of this ability, but it has proven invaluable in identifying potential problems before they become major issues.
