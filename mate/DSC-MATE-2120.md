Item #: DSC-MATE-2120

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2120 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell equipped with a sturdy door and a gas filtration system. A gas mask identical to that worn by DSC-MATE-2120 must be placed in the cell at all times. Access to DSC-MATE-2120 must be restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher and must always be supervised by at least two security officers. Any interaction with DSC-MATE-2120 should be kept as brief as possible to avoid incidents of forgetfulness or absentmindedness.

Description: DSC-MATE-2120 is a male human of average height and build. DSC-MATE-2120's skin coloration appears to be normal, except for the presence of orange stripes located on the face. The head is noted to have several alternating green layers, while the ears are adorned with a single gold earring. DSC-MATE-2120 is often seen wearing a red scarf over their clothing, although this has not proven to be anomalous.

DSC-MATE-2120 presents no anomalous physical symptoms or abilities. However, DSC-MATE-2120 has a personality that leads to absentmindedness and forgetfulness. Their mind may wander uncontrollably while working on a project or lost in thought, leading to situations where DSC-MATE-2120 forgets appointments or loses track of time, resulting in missing important events. DSC-MATE-2120 remains docile and cooperative, but research into the source of this personality trait is ongoing.

Addendum: It has been suggested that DSC-MATE-2120 be recruited by the Foundation to work in real estate. DSC-MATE-2120's absence of thought may prove beneficial when discussing properties, and DSC-MATE-2120's gas mask may provide an additional level of protection against low-level memetic agents that could be present in certain properties. However, further research is necessary to determine if DSC-MATE-2120's forgetfulness could pose a security risk to the Foundation.
