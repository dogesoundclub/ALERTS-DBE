Item #: DSC-MATE-5142

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5142 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██, and is allowed to pursue its occupation as a mechanic provided it remains within Foundation-approved facilities. DSC-MATE-5142 must wear the medical mask at all times while outside of its containment chamber, and must not remove it under any circumstances. Access to DSC-MATE-5142's containment chamber is restricted to Level-3 personnel and above.

Description: DSC-MATE-5142 is a humanoid female, standing approximately 1.72 meters tall and weighing approximately 68 kilograms. DSC-MATE-5142's most notable features include blue clown eyes and a red lip, both of which stand out against its otherwise unremarkable physical appearance. DSC-MATE-5142 typically wears a hooded sweatshirt and a choker, and is known to exhibit a stubborn personality. 

DSC-MATE-5142 is a licensed mechanic and is known to be reliable when it comes to vehicle repair and maintenance. DSC-MATE-5142 is also quite organized and displays an aversion to change, particularly when it comes to its routines or accepting new ideas. This has been known to result in humorous situations when DSC-MATE-5142 encounters unexpected changes or challenges.

DSC-MATE-5142 was first brought to the attention of the Foundation due to reports of its unusual features and consistent use of a medical mask. Following its capture and containment, it was discovered that the medical mask is worn by DSC-MATE-5142 as a result of a severe form of mysophobia.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, during a routine vehicle repair, DSC-MATE-5142 was observed to possess unusual strength and agility, leading to the suspicion that it may exhibit anomalous traits beyond those currently understood. Further testing is recommended.
