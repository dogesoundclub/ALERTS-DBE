Item #: 2636

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2636 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. Due to recurring incidents of random cyber attacks, all electronic devices within SCP-2636's vicinity must be regularly checked and replaced as deemed necessary. Access to SCP-2636 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above with proper authorization.

Description: SCP-2636 appears to be a female humanoid of the Homo sapiens species with a unique set of physical features. Her face is covered in black and white spotted marks, with purple lips and blue clown-like eyes. SCP-2636 wears a purple cap with a headset, gold earring on her left ear, and a black choker around her neck. She is often seen wearing a normal gas mask, which she uses in her occupation as a firefighter.

SCP-2636 is known for her quick wit and love of debate, often engaging in playful arguments with friends and family members. Despite her lighthearted personality, SCP-2636 has demonstrated tactical abilities in high-stress situations, particularly in emergencies. She has an inherent affinity for technology, which has led her to pursue hacking as a hobby. This has resulted in several minor breaches of Foundation cybersecurity measures, for which SCP-2636 has been reprimanded.

SCP-2636's anomaly appears to be limited to her unique physical appearance and her talent for debate. No additional abilities or weaknesses have been detected. However, her hacking activities may pose a potential threat to the Foundation's security measures and must be continuously monitored. 

SCP-2636 was brought to the Foundation's attention after a routine check of firefighters revealed her distinctly anomalous nature. She was promptly contained, and all records regarding her existence were erased from public records. SCP-2636 has since expressed interest in working for the Foundation, though no official decision has been made at this time due to her potential security risks.
