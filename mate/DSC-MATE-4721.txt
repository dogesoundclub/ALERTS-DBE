Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4721 is to be monitored at all times while on the premises of any car dealership. All customers and potential buyers are to be warned of 4721's peculiar appearance and personality traits before any interaction takes place. It is imperative that no conflicts arise due to her argumentative tendencies. Should any such situation arise, security personnel are authorized to neutralize the threat by any means necessary.

Description: Subject 4721 is a female humanoid of the human species, with distinctive facial features that include spots on her skin and a perpetually cheerful smile. Her eyes are bright orange and have an unusual eyebrow shape that resembles a rabbit's. This is most likely due to a genetic anomaly. Subject 4721's head has also taken on a pinkish hue, with a pair of rabbit ears protruding from the top. She typically wears a gold chain around her neck as well as gold earrings.

Subject 4721's personality is known to be analytical and logical, often engaging in debates with others for intellectual stimulation. She enjoys discussing even trivial topics and takes pleasure in intellectual sparring matches with others. However, this can lead to conflicts with others who find her argumentative tendencies to be grating. Additionally, her unique appearance may cause her to be viewed suspiciously, making her appear more antagonistic than she truly is.

Addendum: While recent testing has revealed no overtly dangerous abilities, it is recommended that further study be conducted to determine any potential threats that may arise from her appearance or personality traits. Until such time as a complete understanding of her nature can be obtained, caution is to be exercised around Subject 4721 at all times.
