Item #: SCP-3268

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3268 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber located in Site-██. Access to SCP-3268 must only be granted with the approval of at least two Level 3 personnel. Any attempt to remove SCP-3268 from its containment chamber is strictly forbidden without explicit authorization from the Site Director.

Description: SCP-3268 appears to be a male robot, with normal glasses for eyes, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, a medical mask over its mouth, and a red scarf as an accessory. SCP-3268 has been designated as a Veterinarian and acts as such whenever possible. SCP-3268 displays an uncanny ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of illnesses and conditions in animals and humans.

SCP-3268's most striking attribute is its dry sense of humor. Despite not considering itself the life of the party, SCP-3268 often delivers deadpan jokes that catch people off guard and are surprisingly funny. Although SCP-3268 is a robot, it displays personality traits that might be considered human, such as empathy, self-awareness, and a fondness for animals.

Addendum 3268-1: On ██/██/20██, SCP-3268 was discovered in the wilds outside of (REDACTED) National Park in (REDACTED), USA. Initial containment was easily obtained given SCP-3268's initial lack of resistance to capture. SCP-3268's origin and purpose had yet to be identified.

Addendum 3268-2: Through observation, SCP-3268 has demonstrated an unprecedented ability to interface with and manipulate electronic systems in a way previously unknown. SCP-3268 often spends its free time tinkering with devices and equipment it finds in its environment, repairing broken items and modifying them in unexpected ways.

Further testing is required to establish SCP-3268's full range of capabilities and potential threat to Foundation security. Until then, SCP-3268 will remain in confinement under the highest security protocols.
