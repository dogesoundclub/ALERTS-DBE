Item #: DSC-MATE-2293

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2293 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. The chamber is to be furnished with an assortment of toys and games to stimulate DSC-MATE-2293's mental and emotional health. DSC-MATE-2293 is allowed to have one candy stick per day, as this serves as a calming agent for the entity.

DSC-MATE-2293 must not be allowed to come into the contact with any potential customers, as its innate sense of humor can lead to undesirable financial situations for the Foundation.

Description: DSC-MATE-2293 is a male rabbit of the Lepus genus, standing at 1.5 meters in height. It has a pair of thick-rimmed nerd glasses that it habitually wears. Its fur is predominantly brown in color, with white fur accents on its face, chest, and paws.

DSC-MATE-2293 functions as a car salesman in a local dealership, displaying exceptional skills in marketing and interpersonal communication. Its sense of humor is considered to be one of its most notable traits, often utilizing it to make potential customers feel at ease and comfortable.

DSC-MATE-2293's candy stick serves as a stimulant for the entity's mood, allowing it to maintain a calm and friendly demeanor in customer interactions. Its over-reliance on the candy stick has been noted, and measures are in place to ensure that it is not subjected to addiction to it.

In situations where DSC-MATE-2293 is not in a humorous mood, its personality can manifest as moody and uncooperative, causing challenges to the containment team.  Extra attention is to be paid to DSC-MATE-2293 during such occasions.

Addendum: Researchers have recommended the exploration of the potential of utilizing DSC-MATE-2293 to enhance the Foundation's communication and marketing strategies. This proposal is still under review by the Ethics Committee.
