Item #: 6597

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6597 is to be allowed to carry out its job as a news anchor. Its daily schedule must be monitored, and all recordings of its broadcasts are to be reviewed by Level 2 personnel. SCP-6597 is not to be approached by Foundation members about gift selection, as it often becomes distressed and uncooperative.

Description: SCP-6597 is a male rabbit of an unknown subspecies. It wears a blue bandana around its head and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-6597 appears to constantly smoke a cigarette, despite the fact that it is not biologically equipped to do so. Its eyes are currently unknown.

SCP-6597's most defining feature is its constant expression of fear, especially in the form of a frightened mouth. Despite its trepidation, SCP-6597 is very observant and attentive to details, which can make them excellent gift-givers. However, they may also be overly concerned with giving the "perfect" gift and can spend a lot of time agonizing over what to get someone.

SCP-6597 was discovered after several reports of anomalous local news broadcasts, in which SCP-6597 appeared to be predicting events before they happened. Further investigation revealed that SCP-6597 has the ability to see brief glimpses of the future, although it is unable to control or fully comprehend these visions.

SCP-6597 is cooperative with Foundation efforts to document and research its abilities. However, it becomes agitated and uncooperative when questioned about gift-giving, as it seems to find the process of selecting gifts very stressful.

Addendum: SCP-6597's predictions have proven useful in several containment operations, although they are often cryptic and difficult to interpret. Further research is ongoing to fully understand the nature of SCP-6597's powers.
