Item #: 4832

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 4832 is to be kept in a locked room in the Personnel Department of [REDACTED] Transit Authority. Access to this room is restricted only to Level 3 Personnel and above. Any attempt to remove or interact with Item 4832 by unauthorized personnel will result in immediate action and potential disciplinary consequences.

Description: 4832 is a male human train driver with blue clown eyes that emit an unknown energy field when they come into direct contact with any technology. Even the slightest touch from the subject can cause mechanical devices to malfunction and appear to be eerily sentient. This effect, however, does not appear to have any adverse effect on organic life.

The appearance of the subject is very distinctive, with a singular large spot on his mouth and a subtle smile on his face. He wears a bucket hat on his head, adorned with a red victory band on his forehead; his distinctive feature is the LED gas mask situated over his mouth, which is always glowing with a bluish tinged light.

Personality: 4832 presents as highly organized and efficient, but can come across as controlling at times. This can be demonstrated in their need to delegate and take control of events in a matter-of-fact way, which can result in amusing situations arising.

Addendum: 4832 was discovered working as a train driver in the [REDACTED] Transit Authorities commuter rail system during an investigation into individual reports of malfunctioning trains. The subject was apprehended without issue, and no casualties were recorded during the retrieval of the subject.

Further investigation into the anomalyâ€™s potential infiltrating abilities on other technology is still ongoing.
