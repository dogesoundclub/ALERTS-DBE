Item #: SCP-4697

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4697 is to be kept in a secure facility designed for housing humanoid robots. All staff coming into contact with SCP-4697 should wear face masks and gloves to prevent the spread of any possible infections, although SCP-4697 has not shown any evidence of carrying or transmitting diseases. Regular maintenance checks must be conducted to ensure SCP-4697 remains in optimal condition.

Description: SCP-4697 is a male robot with a distinctive appearance, featuring an eye-catching Doge hat on top of its head, and a pair of horned rim glasses resting on its eyes. In addition, SCP-4697 is usually seen with a grey medical mask covering its mouth, and a gold earring on its left ear. It is also known to wear a silver chain as an accessory.

Although SCP-4697 is a robot, it is programmed with a personality that is both analytical and logical, with a quirky sense of humor. It often makes witty observations, and enjoys teasing its friends in a dry, deadpan way. SCP-4697 also possesses a high level of physical strength, as it is primarily used as a firefighter robot.

SCP-4697's design and purpose was created by an unknown entity, but there is evidence to suggest that it may have been designed with the aid of SCP-████, a possible anomalous entity capable of controlling machines through unknown means.

Addendum: SCP-4697 has expressed interest in learning more about human behavior and emotions, and has been allowed to interact with Foundation staff as a way to study and understand them better. However, it should be noted that SCP-4697's programming may not allow for full empathy or understanding of human emotions. Any attempts to modify SCP-4697's programming must first be authorized by Level 3 personnel or higher.
