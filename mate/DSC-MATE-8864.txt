Item #: SCP-8864

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8864 is to be employed as a traffic officer under Foundation personnel posing as municipal government agents. SCP-8864 is to be provided with standard Foundation-issue gas mask in situations where respiratory protection is necessary.

SCP-8864 is to be monitored at all times for potential anomalies, and any deviations from normal human behavior are to be reported to the nearest Foundation site immediately. SCP-8864 may be authorized to deploy standard Foundation gear and procedures as deemed necessary in the event of an anomaly.

Description: SCP-8864 is a human female with orange stripes on her face and red lips. SCP-8864 wears a retro cap with goggles on her forehead, normal prescription glasses, a gold earring, and a silver chain. SCP-8864 carries a normal gas mask as protective gear when necessary.

SCP-8864 displays a great sense of humor and enjoys making others laugh. SCP-8864 may tell funny stories or do silly impersonations to lighten the mood in any situation, which can lead to humorous and unexpected outcomes.

SCP-8864, despite being a normal human, has been identified as a potential reality bender through its ability to create or manifest anomalies via its humor-induced reality-warping ability. SCP-8864 has demonstrated the ability to tear a hole in reality with its humor, altering and manipulating reality itself.

Addendum: Due to the recent manifestation of anomalous properties in SCP-8864, research on SCP-8864's ability is to be continued under O5 council direction. Until further notice, SCP-8864 is to be subject to additional Foundation monitoring and containment measures.
