Item #: DSC-MATE-5807

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5807 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The cell is to be outfitted with a standard bed, chair, and desk, along with all necessary medical equipment for treatment and maintenance of DSC-MATE-5807's health.

Description: DSC-MATE-5807 appears to be a humanoid male, approximately 34 years of age, with red clown eyes and a red beanie on his head. DSC-MATE-5807 also sports a jade earring in his left ear, a gold chain around his neck, and is often seen with a cigarette in his mouth.

DSC-MATE-5807 claims to be a doctor, and has demonstrated expertise in various medical practices, including surgery, medication, and basic first aid. However, DSC-MATE-5807's medical license cannot be verified, and it is unclear whether his abilities are anomalous in nature.

DSC-MATE-5807 possesses a laid-back and easy-going personality, often joking and making light of stressful situations. However, DSC-MATE-5807 can also become fiercely protective of his loved ones, engaging in heated arguments and even physical altercations with those who insult or threaten his friends or family members.

It is currently unknown whether DSC-MATE-5807's physical appearance and abilities are related to any anomalous behavior or abilities. Further testing and observation is required to determine the true nature of this anomaly.

Addendum: Following Incident ████-███, where DSC-MATE-5807 successfully performed an emergency surgery on a Foundation staff member, DSC-MATE-5807 has been granted Level 2 clearance and is now allowed limited access to medical facilities within Site-███. It is hoped that this will increase DSC-MATE-5807's cooperation and support for Foundation efforts.
