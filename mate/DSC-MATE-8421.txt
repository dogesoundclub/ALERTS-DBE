Item #: SCP-8421

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8421 is to be kept at all times in a secure, hanger-like building inside a Site-77 location. The containment chamber should be lit with low lighting to reduce the appearance of the frightened mouth of SCP-8421. There should always be one assigned Level 3 personnel, who are familiar with SCP-8421, to monitor the robot at all times.

Description: SCP-8421 was once an autonomous robot designed specifically for the purpose of driving trains. The robot's external appearance is adorned with a blue bandana wrapped around its head, signaling the presence of a "cowboy"-like personality. SCP-8421's right ear pierces through with a jade earring, which has no known significance. In addition, SCP-8421 wears a silver chain around its neck, which may or may not provide a sense of security to the robot.

SCP-8421 has demonstrated sapient thought processes and remarkable flexibility in its decision-making, leading to its reclassification as a Euclid class object. The robot has a love for adventure, and will thus take risks and try new things. Given its particular affliction and its interactions with researchers, caution must be taken in the circumstances where the robot wants to visit locations it has never been before, as SCP-8421 is particularly sensitive to feeling lost.

Addendum: Despite SCP-8421's apparent sapience, it displays no detectable form of communication through any known means.

By order of the O5 Council, any attempts to have SCP-8421 communicate via speech or other known means must be authorized by at least two Level 4 personnel. Only then are Class D personnel authorized to begin the final stages of the communication attempts. Any such attempts must be carried out with caution, as SCP-8421's frightened mouth cannot be properly interpreted in the absence of the robot's intended communication. Work on establishing non-verbal communication may be a better approach.
