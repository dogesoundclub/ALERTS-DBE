SCP Foundation Classification: Euclid

Containment Procedures: SCP-8646 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The walls must be reinforced with steel plating to prevent any attempts at escape. In addition, SCP-8646's goggle and gas mask must be confiscated and stored in a secure locker.  Any interaction with SCP-8646 must be done with extreme caution and with a minimum of two armed guards present.

Description: SCP-8646 is a male tiger with red clown eyes, standing at approximately 7 feet tall on its hind legs. Its forelimbs are capable of manipulating objects with a high degree of dexterity. SCP-8646's most unique features are the goggle it wears on its forehead and the gas mask it carries. The significance of these accessories is unknown.

SCP-8646 exhibits an impulsive and spontaneous personality. It often engages in risky behaviors and takes on challenges on a whim. This behavior has resulted in numerous humorous situations but also presents a danger to itself and others.

SCP-8646 is a licensed veterinarian and has proven to be competent in treating animal patients. Its proficiency in the field of medicine, combined with its physical capabilities, makes it a valuable asset in situations where speedy veterinary care is required.

Addendum: SCP-8646 became a Foundation asset after being discovered performing medical procedures on a pack of wild animals injured in a nearby forest. Foundation agents observed SCP-8646's unusual characteristics and deemed it a potential threat. After initial containment, SCP-8646 was determined to not pose an immediate threat but classified as Euclid due to its impulsive nature.
