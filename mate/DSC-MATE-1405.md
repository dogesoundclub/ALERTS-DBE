Item #: 1405

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be kept in a standard containment chamber outfitted with an air filtration system. All personnel entering the chamber are required to don personal protective equipment. In the event of a breach, all personnel are to evacuate immediately and the chamber is to be flooded with a combination of lethal gases.

Description: Item #1405 appears to be a male rabbit, approximately 30 cm in length, weighing approximately 2 kg. The subject is often observed wearing a gold chain around its neck and a gas mask for reasons unknown. However, both items have been determined to be non-anomalous.

Item #1405 is known for its highly detail-oriented personality, making them an ideal candidate for security work. However, this trait also makes it predisposed to obsessive-compulsive behaviors, often manifesting with unusual tasks such as alphabetizing spice racks and color-coding closets.

Though Item #1405 does not appear to have any additional anomalous properties, it has been observed to possess advanced awareness and intelligence, suggesting further study may be necessary.

Due to its unpredictable behaviors and potential security risks, all personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution when in the presence of Item #1405. Any changes in demeanor or behavior should be reported immediately to supervising staff.

Addendum: On 06/05/20██, Item #1405 was noted to have breached containment due to a lack of proper security protocols. The subject was observed escaping into the surrounding city, where it remains at large. A general alert has been issued, and all personnel are advised to be on high alert for any potential sightings of the subject.
