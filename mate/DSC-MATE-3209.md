Item #: 3209

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3209 is to be kept under standard humanoid containment procedures, in a cell fitted with basic amenities. Access to entertainment must be limited to prevent overindulgence in illicit substances.

Description: 3209 is a human male in his late twenties, with a cheery disposition and a permanent smile that belies his tough exterior. He is commonly found wearing a vintage cap with a silver chain hanging from it. His eyes are fitted with what the locals refer to as 'nerd glasses', further adding to his affable appearance. His accessory of choice is an old fashioned candy stick, often seen stuck to the corner of his mouth.

Personality wise, 3209's sense of duty and responsibility towards his job is apparent. But he can switch gears easily and let loose, especially when surrounded by people at social events. His silly antics on the dance floor are a source of joy for many, with his dance moves often coming as a pleasant surprise. 

Notably, 3209 is skilled in unarmed combat and has received some training in martial arts. He has requested to take up additional combat training to hone his skills and is willing to cooperate with Foundation Personnel to achieve this.

DogeSoundClub Notes: Subject 3209 is an affable and eager individual who brings a sense of positivity to those around him. His combat training, coupled with his happy-go-lucky persona, make him an asset to the Foundation. However care must be taken to keep him away from any temptations that may interfere with his judgment.
