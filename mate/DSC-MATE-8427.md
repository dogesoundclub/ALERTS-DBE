Description: DSC-MATE-8427 is a human male believed to be in his mid-30s. It stands approximately 180cm in height and weighs around 85kg. Its most notable feature is the spots on its face, which are spread across its nose and cheeks. DSC-MATE-8427 typically wears a hoodie over its head, along with a red scarf draped around its neck. It can often be seen wearing red victory bands on its forehead and a pair of nerd glasses over its eyes. In addition, DSC-MATE-8427 frequently dons a normal gas mask.

DSC-MATE-8427's personality is characterized by an almost stubborn independence. Despite the possible risks, DSC-MATE-8427 will often choose to work alone and refuse any help offered to it. This attitude extends beyond its work as a traffic officer and has led to several comedic situations, such as attempting to move heavy objects by itself or refusing to use a map when lost.

DSC-MATE-8427's abilities and anomalies are currently unknown, but its independent and isolated nature has led the Foundation to consider further investigation into its behavior. As of now, DSC-MATE-8427's containment is considered ongoing, and Foundation personnel will closely monitor its actions and movements in the city.
