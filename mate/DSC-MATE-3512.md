Item #: 3512

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 3512 is to be kept in a highly secured vault at all times, away from any potential threats to its safety. Access to 3512 is to be granted only with the approval of Level 4 personnel or higher. Any attempt to alter or tamper with 3512 should be immediately reported to the Foundation's technical team. Any individuals found attempting to access the vault without proper authorization should be escorted off the premises.

Description: 3512 is a robot of male sex, currently serving as a banker for a prominent international financial institution. 3512's face features a permanently frightened mouth, while its eyes are covered by horn-rimmed glasses. The robot's head is adorned with a red beanie, and it is normally accessorized with a silver chain and a whistle, which is believed to function as a form of self-defense.

3512's primary anomaly is its ability to detect and empathize with human emotions. Though it lacks the capability to experience emotions, it demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the human psyche, which allows it to be highly attuned to different emotional states. This has led to several humorous situations in which 3512 knows exactly what to say to put a person at ease, or gently tease them, often resulting in a more positive outcome for both parties involved.

Addendum: Despite its benign nature, 3512's anomaly should not be taken lightly. Its use as a tool for financial gain within the institution where it works is of concern to the Foundation, and we must keep a close watch on any potential abuses of its capabilities. Instances of 3512 demonstrating loyalty to its institution over the Foundation's interests should be noted and penalized appropriately.
