Item #: SCP-8102

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8102 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The containment chamber is to be equipped with a computer interface and necessary tools for maintenance purposes. The chamber will be accessed only by authorized personnel upon entrance clearance by at least two Level 3 Security Officers. At no circumstances should SCP-8102 be left unattended for an extended period. Any unauthorized contact with SCP-8102 is prohibited. 

Description: SCP-8102 is an advanced, bipedal robot with a distinct green cyclops eye for a face. Its eyes resemble a pair of ski goggles and its head is adorned with a retro cap. SCP-8102 wears a red cross earring on one ear and a gold chain as an accessory around its neck. It stands around 6 feet in height and weighs approximately 400 pounds. 

SCP-8102 was discovered in 20██ in a junkyard, where it was being dismantled for scrap metal. Foundation agents intervened, secured the robot, and brought it under containment. SCP-8102's capabilities, abilities, and origin are unclear, as information on its design and purpose has not been found. However, as it is able to perform advanced mechanical work with precision, it is considered a valuable asset to the Foundation. 

SCP-8102 has displayed intelligence far beyond conventional mechanical counterparts, coupled with an outgoing and social personality. It craves attention and becomes the center of attention due to its jokes and hilarious anecdotes, which often leave its audience in fits of laughter. 

Addendum 8102-A: SCP-8102's development and mechanical capabilities are of particular interest to the Foundation. Foundation robotics experts have been studying their design and implementation over the years, trying to learn more about their creators and potential uses in the future. However, we proceed with caution and assume that, for all intents and purposes, SCP-8102 is a sentient being and must be treated as such.
