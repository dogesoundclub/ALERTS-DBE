SCP-2136, codename "The Candyman," is an anomalous human delivery driver exhibiting facial features characterized by orange stripes with a permanent smile. His eyes are disguised by thick nerd glasses, and his head possesses an edgy mohawk. The subject habitually wears a bright red scarf and carries a candy stick. 

SCP-2136 manifests a unique personality characterized by an extreme attention to detail, sometimes bordering on compulsive behaviour, that correlates with alphabetizing his spice rack or color-coding his closet. Unusual tendencies may show themselves in unexpected ways, resulting in time delays in his delivery schedule. 

It is unknown the effect SCP-2136's prevalent candy addiction may have on his anomalous properties, but it is closely monitored. His dangerous side has yet to be identified, and it should be handled with caution if triggered. Consequently, he is an unremarkable asset to the Foundation, with minimal risk warranting his containment.
