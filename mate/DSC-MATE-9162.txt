SCP-9162 is a male tiger of unknown origin currently employed as a Real Estate Agent. Its facial features include a frightened mouth and unsettling blue clown eyes. Its head is covered in green hair and adorned with a purple cap. A notable feature on its forehead is a two-color band. SCP-9162 has a finely crafted jade earring in each ear. 

SCP-9162's personality is erratic and unpredictable, with a tendency to get sidetracked easily. Although it possesses considerable knowledge of the local housing market, SCP-9162 can be forgetful and may miss important appointments or forget details of properties being shown, leading to various unusual and often humorous situations. Field agents are advised to exercise caution when dealing with SCP-9162, as its unstable temperament can make it difficult to predict its actions.
