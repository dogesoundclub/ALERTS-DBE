SCP-8683 is to be kept in a locked, soundproofed room, with no outside sound or stimulus permitted in. Food is to be provided at regular intervals, but physical observation is to be limited. The only communication is to be done via video camera and two-way mirror. Unauthorized personnel are not to be permitted within three meters of SCP-8683.

Description:

SCP-8683 is a male Siberian Tiger in appearance, though there is a red beanie on its head, a jade earring on its left ear, a medical mask across its mouth, and a gold chain around its neck. These accessories seem to be purely cosmetic and have no anomalous qualities.

SCP-8683 has shown intelligence and cognitive skills beyond its species. It has successfully completed various puzzles, understood consequences and rewards, and communicates through a variety of non-verbal cues. They have a distinctive personality that is strong willed, which can come across as bossy or intimidating, but it's all primarily due to their wish to make sure things get done efficiently and effectively.

Addendum:

SCP-8683 is a banker, and was found in possession of counterfeit money, which triggered local law enforcement. During the investigation, it was noted that the tiger appeared to be using the materialistic world to its advantage. Further testing and observation is ongoing.
