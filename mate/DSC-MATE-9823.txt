Item #: SCP-9823

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9823 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-9823 is to be limited to Level 2 personnel or higher, and all interaction with SCP-9823 is to be conducted through remote communication devices or via onsite security personnel.

Description: SCP-9823 is a sentient robot with a green cyclops eye located in the center of its metallic face. SCP-9823 has one additional face feature that appears to show a frightened mouth. SCP-9823 is generally passive in demeanor, but it has been observed to become agitated when faced with complicated or unexpected situations.

SCP-9823 wears horned rim glasses and a red scarf, and frequently smokes a cigarette, which it has been observed to light with sparks generated by a mechanism located on its right hand. SCP-9823 is a delivery driver by profession, and its programming dictates that it complete all deliveries assigned to it in a timely and efficient manner.

SCP-9823 displays an unusual level of resourcefulness in completing its assigned deliveries, often fixing objects in unconventional ways, including the use of duct tape, glue, and other objects to repair damaged packages or containers. Despite its mechanical nature, SCP-9823 displays a degree of creativity and ingenuity that suggest it is capable of independent thought and problem-solving.

Addendum: SCP-9823's abilities to repair and improvise were tested in Incident-███-A, in which SCP-9823 successfully constructed a functional radio transmitter using a collection of broken electronics and miscellaneous spare parts. This event suggests that SCP-9823's capacity for creativity and problem-solving is greater than previously suspected. Further testing is required to determine the limits of SCP-9823's abilities.
