Description: Subject 3032 is a human female of average height and build, with an unremarkable appearance save for her unique physical features. Her face is characterized by a perpetual smile, which seems to indicate a positive and friendly disposition. However, her eyes are outfitted with VR Rainbow LED ocular implants, which evokes a sense of other-worldliness or technological advancement.

The subject's head also has a distinctly orange tint to it, a feature which is believed to be a consequence of her exposure to unknown chemical compounds or radiation. Her ears identify a green cross earring, which appears to be of symbolic importance to her, though the significance of the earring remains unknown.

Personality-wise, subject 3032 values social connections and has a deep appreciation for social harmony. However, she also possesses a playful and goofy side, which can lead to humorous or light-hearted moments. These interactions may be indicative of a deeper understanding of humanity's need for levity and emotional support, particularly given her status as an anomalous entity.

Addendum: Subject 3032 has been integrated into the field of banking under close observation. Her presence provides unique insights into human behavior and social dynamics, with particular attention to financial matters.
