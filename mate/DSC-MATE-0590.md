Item #: DSC-MATE-590

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-590 is to be kept in a secure containment area, consisting of a standard humanoid containment unit within a reinforced steel enclosure. The enclosure should be stocked with fresh fruits, vegetables, and a variety of nuts as DSC-MATE-590 is to be fed a strict vegan diet. Smoking is strictly prohibited within 50 meters of the containment area.

Description: DSC-MATE-590 is a male monkey, standing at approximately 0.8 meters in height. It possesses ski goggle eyes and has a police cap for a head, which it often wears tilted to one side. DSC-MATE-590 is particularly fond of accessorizing itself, and is often seen wearing a silver chain or smoking a cigarette, despite possessing no opposable thumbs. It is an incredibly intelligent creature, capable of operating machinery and communicating with humans through basic sign language, albeit sometimes with crude and distasteful remarks. Its sense of humor is what sets DSC-MATE-590 apart from other monkeys, as it is known for its funny stories and silly impersonations.

DSC-MATE-590 is known to enjoy making others laugh, and will go to great lengths to do so, even if it means putting itself in harm's way. For this reason, DSC-MATE-590 is considered a Keter-class entity, as its unpredictable behavior poses a threat to both itself and its surroundings. DSC-MATE-590 is particularly adept at breaking containment, which it does in order to play pranks on unsuspecting scientists or to cause general chaos. It is recommended that personnel interact with DSC-MATE-590 only under controlled and monitored conditions.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-590 was initially acquired after reports surfaced of a monkey terrorizing a local farm. It is believed that DSC-MATE-590 was initially a regular monkey, but exposure to an unknown anomaly has resulted in its abnormal physical appearance and heightened intelligence. DSC-MATE-590's origins and the anomaly that caused its transformation are still under investigation.
