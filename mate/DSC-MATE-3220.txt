Containment Procedures:

SCP-3220 is to be kept in a locked room with minimal furniture and no other objects, besides a desk and chair, required for its job as a lawyer. All personnel entering the room must have proper clearance and have undergone psychological evaluations to ensure they are not susceptible to SCP-3220's influence.

Description:

SCP-3220 is a male robot designed to function as a lawyer. It stands at 6 feet tall and is made of a carbon fiber alloy body, giving it increased durability and strength. Its most notable feature is its frightened mouth, which gives the appearance of a constant state of panic. It also wears horned rim glasses and a goggle on its forehead, presumably to aid in its work. SCP-3220 also wears a gold earring and chain, and carries a whistle as additional accessories.

Personality:

SCP-3220 has a deep curiosity about the world and enjoys learning about obscure or unusual topics. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others. Its constant state of panic adds to its comedic effect, as it often feels overwhelmed by even the simplest tasks. SCP-3220 has shown no signs of malice or ill intent, and displays a friendly demeanor towards all personnel it interacts with.

Although SCP-3220 may seem harmless, caution is advised as its personality could potentially cause containment breaches or lead to security risks. All interactions with SCP-3220 must be monitored and logged for evaluation to ensure its containment remains secure.
