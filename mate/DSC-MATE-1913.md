Item #: 1913

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1913 is to be stationed at a secure research facility and is not to leave the premises without proper authorization. Her living quarters must be maintained in a way that takes into account her preference for logical and orderly arrangements, within a limited budget. Any arguments or debates DSC-MATE-1913 initiates must be monitored closely and carefully, especially if they involve significant risks such as exposure of Foundation secrets.

Description: DSC-MATE-1913 is a human female of average build and height, with strikingly unusual features. She has bright orange stripes on her arms and legs, and her eyes resemble those of a clown, being colored a vivid bright blue. Her hair is predominantly black and is usually covered by a hoodie. DSC-MATE-1913 can frequently be observed smoking cigarettes and wearing a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-1913 is a skilled programmer and prefers to work alone, often coding for long hours without interruption. She is analytical, logical and detail-oriented, tending to find interest in even the most mundane topics, often seeking to debate or argue with others for amusement. DSC-MATE-1913 has a talent for coming up with creative solutions to complex problems, although her ability to focus on tasks can be disrupted if she encounters an unexpected social or emotional event.

Recovery Log: DSC-MATE-1913's background is unknown, but the Foundation discovered her after a network penetration attempt by an anomalous and unknown online hacking group caused severe network damage. The Foundation traced the source of the intrusion to DSC-MATE-1913 and recruited her as Foundation personnel after an undercover operation. While DSC-MATE-1913 has no apparent knowledge of the anomalous, her technical knowledge and programming skills represented too valuable an asset for the Foundation to ignore.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1913 has been allowed to continue smoking cigarettes, but under strict supervision, to prevent the location of the facility from becoming compromised. Any attempts by her to breach security or access classified information must be dealt with immediately by her handler.
