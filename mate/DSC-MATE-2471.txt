Item #: 2471

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2471 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The subject must wear the LED gas mask at all times, which will be connected to a power source via a surge protector to prevent any electrical incidents. The electrician staff must inspect the subject's cell daily for any electrical abnormalities or attempts to tamper with the restraints.

Description: 

Subject 2471 is a female humanoid wearing an Ushanka hat. The subject's face is marked with random spots, which are randomly distributed on the face. Both of the subject's blue clown eyes are extremely rare in the human population, which the significance is yet to be determined. Subject's forehead bears a white and black two-color band, which might be related to a gang affiliation, but not sufficient enough for confirming the theory. Subject's ears have Jade earrings.

Subject 2471 displays an affinity for generating novel and creative ideas. Interview records indicate that the subject does this by making a vast range of improbable suggestions in response to whatever query is presented to them. As a result, it was concluded that individuals subjected to such situations elicit some perverse enjoyment from making off-the-wall statements across any medium or field.

Addendum:

Subject 2471 displayed and mapped into the SCP on the account of unknown electrical anomalies, for which the subject was hired to alleviate. The Foundation noticed strange electrical behavior in the subject, from making small light bulbs go out when agitated or powerful lighting strikes the room when angry, but this phenomena is reported to be acute in nature. All necessary measures have been taken to keep Subject 2471's proclivity for electrical interference under close observation, while their natural brainstorming tendencies will continue to be assessed.
