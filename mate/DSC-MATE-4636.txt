Item #: SCP-4636

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4636 is to be kept in a secure facility with limited access to prevent unauthorized interaction with personnel. Under no circumstances is SCP-4636 to be granted access to any medical equipment, medication, or other materials that may be used to repair or modify itself. Any attempts by SCP-4636 to access such materials must be reported immediately to the onsite supervisor. 

Description: SCP-4636 is an anomalous robot species resembling a male human. Its head is adorned with a blue bandana, and it wears nerd glasses, a gold earring, and a gold chain around its neck. It is typically seen holding a cigarette in its hand.

SCP-4636's personality traits include a high degree of organization and efficiency, which can sometimes manifest as controlling behavior. It is known to take charge of group events and projects, and delegate tasks to others with a matter-of-fact approach. 

SCP-4636's design resembles that of a medical doctor, and it has claimed that its primary function is to be a physician. However, it is unclear whether SCP-4636's abilities align with that of a human doctor or if it possesses any other anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-4636 has raised alarms among the onsite staff due to multiple attempts to access medical equipment and medication. Further investigation is needed to determine if SCP-4636 poses a potential threat to the facility and its personnel.
