SCP-6606 is a human male occupying the position of Traffic Officer. He boasts bright and intricate spots adorned across his face, a rare feature for a human. His eyes are tightly bound by a pair of ski goggles that emit a menacing glow, making eye contact near impossible. His blonde hair falls flat on a lopsided head, as regular as any mundane. A dazzling gold earring embellishes his ears, further accentuating the wild aura he exudes. A gold chain looped around his wrist jingles every time he moves, adding to the infectious energy that surrounds him.

One of his most notable accessories is an LED gas mask that covers half of his face, straining his words to a muffled screech, rendering him almost unintelligible. His personality is one of immense energy and enthusiasm, his desire to create excitement infecting others. Even in casual conversations, he gets animated over trivial things, causing some amusing misunderstandings. SCP-6606 is a force to be reckoned with and should be kept at arm's length in all interactions.
