SCP FILE 3151: "The Rogue Tiger Train Driver"

DESCRIPTION: 

SCP-3151 is a male tiger of the Bengal subspecies. He measures approximately 2.5 meters in length and weighs 250 kilograms. Despite his intimidating appearance, SCP-3151 is approachable and has shown no signs of aggression when interacting with Foundation staff.

SCP-3151 currently holds the job of a train driver, operating on various routes for the regional transit authority. The tiger wears a police cap and a pair of nerd glasses while on the job, in an attempt to appear more human-like. Additionally, he has been observed wearing a gold earring and a gold chain around his neck as accessories.

SCP-3151 is known for his rebellious streak and enjoys pushing boundaries. He has been observed breaking minor rules and finding ways to bend them, presumably to see what consequences may occur. However, SCP-3151 has never attempted to cause any harm to fellow employees or passengers.

PERSONALITY: 

SCP-3151 exhibits an uncharacteristic level of humor and playfulness. He has been observed playing pranks on coworkers and passengers, primarily by hiding their belongings or leaving small toys and trinkets in unexpected places. This behavior does not appear to be malicious but seems to serve as a form of entertainment for SCP-3151.

SCP-3151's rebellious nature may be a result of his dissatisfaction with his current circumstances. It is unclear if he is aware of his anomalous abilities or if he is simply unhappy with being confined to his current job. The tiger has expressed interest in traveling and exploring, suggesting that he may yearn for a sense of freedom.

CONCLUSION: 

SCP-3151 is a unique anomaly, displaying behavior that is not commonly observed in animals or humans. While he has not displayed any violent tendencies, his unpredictable behavior and potential dissatisfaction with his circumstances require careful monitoring. Further research is required to determine the extent of SCP-3151's anomalous capabilities and to develop an appropriate containment plan.
