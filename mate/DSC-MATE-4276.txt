Item #: SCP-4276

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4276 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. As SCP-4276 has been employed as a security guard, its monitoring and containment will be the responsibility of Site Security. SCP-4276 is to be provided with regular psychological evaluations and medication to prevent its bouts of daydreaming.

Description: SCP-4276 is a male tiger of the species Panthera tigris. Its physical appearance is similar to that of a fully grown male tiger, except for its VR Rainbow LED eyes, gold earring on its left ear, medical mask covering its mouth, and a silver chain hanging around its neck. SCP-4276's personality is characterized by its tendency to be very introspective and lost in thought. SCP-4276 may spend hours daydreaming, often leading to accidents such as walking into objects or tripping.

SCP-4276 was originally discovered wandering the streets of ██████, United States wearing a security uniform and badge. Local authorities detained SCP-4276 after receiving multiple reports of a "tiger walking around town." SCP Foundation agents were alerted to SCP-4276's presence and subsequently contained it.

SCP-4276 was found to possess a high level of intelligence and was able to communicate fluently in English. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that SCP-4276 had been a security guard at a local mall before escaping from its enclosure. SCP-4276 has since been employed by the SCP Foundation as a security guard at Site-██.

Addendum 4276-01: During a routine psychological evaluation, it was discovered that SCP-4276 had developed an unusual affection for Dr. ███. SCP-4276's daydreaming episodes frequently involve Dr. ███, often resulting in SCP-4276 hallucinating that Dr. ███ is present in its containment chamber. SCP-4276 has been provided with increased medication to prevent these episodes. Dr. ███ has also been advised to avoid contact with SCP-4276.
