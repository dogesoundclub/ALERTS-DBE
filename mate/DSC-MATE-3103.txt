Item #: SCP-3103

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3103 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. No special accommodations or treatment are necessary at this time, but any changes in behavior or anomalous activities should be reported immediately to on-site security personnel.

Description: SCP-3103 appears to be a middle-aged human female with spotted skin and red lips. They wear normal prescription glasses and have a head of unarranged green hair. A pair of goggles rests on their forehead, and they wear jade earrings in their ears.

SCP-3103 is the manager of a local theater and often interacts with members of the public in this role. They possess a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard, and despite not considering themselves to be the life of the party, have a talent for delivering deadpan jokes that can be surprisingly funny.

No anomalous properties have been detected in SCP-3103 at this time, but they will continue to be monitored to ensure the safety of Foundation personnel and the public.
