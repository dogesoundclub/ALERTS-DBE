Item #: 6048

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6048 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a surveillance camera. DSC-MATE-6048 is not allowed to leave the containment chamber without express permission from a Level 3 personnel. Any attempt by DSC-MATE-6048 to breach containment must be met with appropriate force.

Description: DSC-MATE-6048 is a male monkey with a distinctive mohawk. DSC-MATE-6048 also wears a red scarf as its preferred accessory. DSC-MATE-6048 displays a strong sense of independence and rebellion when confronted with authority, especially those it views as unnecessary. This behavior has led to several containment breaches in the past, which has caused significant property damage. DSC-MATE-6048 is able to communicate with humans through hand gestures and limited sign language.

Personality: DSC-MATE-6048 displays a strong sense of independence and rebellion, which often translates to an unwillingness to follow rules or authority figures. DSC-MATE-6048 enjoys entertaining people and has a passion for the arts, which led to its role as a theater manager before containment. DSC-MATE-6048 can be charming and funny, but its temper is unpredictable, and it can become aggressive if it feels threatened or cornered.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6048 was recovered in a community theater in ██████, after several reports of a "talking monkey causing chaos" in the building. Foundation agents were dispatched to the location, and DSC-MATE-6048 was successfully contained after a brief struggle. DSC-MATE-6048's former employers reported that it had been an exemplary theater manager, and that its behavior had only started to become erratic in the weeks leading up to containment. DSC-MATE-6048's rebellious nature makes it a difficult subject to manage, but its love of the arts has resulted in some fascinating observations, such as its mimicry of human actors and performers.
