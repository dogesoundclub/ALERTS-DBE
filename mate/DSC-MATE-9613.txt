Item #: SCP-9613

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9613 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Communication with SCP-9613 requires prior authorization from at least one Level 3 personnel. In the event of a containment breach, Foundation personnel should locate and recontain SCP-9613 as quickly as possible. SCP-9613 is allowed to work as an electrician but must return to its containment chamber at the end of the workday.

Description: SCP-9613 appears to be a human male of average height and weight. Its face features two orange stripes and a frightened mouth. Its eyes are like blue clown eyes, and it always wears a police cap. SCP-9613 has two accessories: a silver chain and a cigarette. SCP-9613 is known for its quick wit and love of debate. This personality trait has caused SCP-9613 to engage in playful arguments with friends and family members just for fun.

SCP-9613's anomalous properties manifest during electrical work. When SCP-9613 works on electrical machines or wires, it shows extraordinary abilities. It can manipulate, control, and rewire electrical systems without the need for standard electrical tools. The extent of SCP-9613's abilities is unknown, but it has so far demonstrated the ability to control electrical systems remotely and create electrical shields.

SCP-9613's abilities appear to be tied to its emotional state. When SCP-9613 becomes agitated or angry, its abilities increase exponentially, increasing the risk of a containment breach. SCP-9613 must be monitored regularly and kept under strict psychological evaluations to prevent any escalation in anomalous abilities.

Addendum: SCP-9613 is currently allowed to work as an electrician as long as it is monitored by Foundation personnel. All electrical interference or anomalies must be reported immediately to avoid any breach.
