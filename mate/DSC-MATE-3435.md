Despite his seeming incompetence, DSC-MATE-3435 has demonstrated the ability to cause significant harm to both people and property. His exact abilities are unknown, but he has been observed to possess exceptional strength, agility, and speed. He also appears to have some sort of control over fire, which he often uses to cause destruction and chaos.

DSC-MATE-3435 is considered extremely dangerous, and should not be approached under any circumstances. All personnel must remain vigilant and prepared to respond to any potential breaches or attacks. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel should immediately evacuate the area and contact Site Security.
