Item #: SCP-3667

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3667 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. All visitors must undergo mental and emotional evaluation before being allowed contact with SCP-3667.

SCP-3667 is a fashion designer of human origin, with a unique appearance featuring spots on her face as her primary distinguishing characteristic. SCP-3667's eyes have been replaced with VR Jade LED, which allow her to perceive and interpret colors beyond a human range. Her head is adorned with a headset fitted with LED features that can change colors and patterns at will.

SCP-3667 is fitted with a gold chain accessory, which she wears at all times. The chain has shown no anomalous properties thus far.

SCP-3667's personality is characterized by a strong emotional connection to art and music, which may elicit profound feelings that manifest through tears. Caution should be taken when exposing SCP-3667 to emotionally charged stimuli, as it may result in uncontrolled emotional outbursts.

Description: SCP-3667 is a 31-year old female of average height and weight, with marked spots on her face that extend down her neck and upper torso. Her hair color and style vary, but she tends to wear eccentric and colorful outfits that reflect her profession as a fashion designer.

SCP-3667's eyes have been surgically replaced with non-anomalous VR Jade LED, which enhance her perception and interpretation of colors. The LED features on her headset are also non-anomalous, and serve as an aesthetic expression of her personality.

SCP-3667 exhibits no signs of any physical or mental illness, but she has been observed to display heightened emotional sensitivity and empathy toward others. SCP-3667 is cooperative and compliant with Foundation personnel but may become distressed if reminded of traumatic events from her past.

Addendum: SCP-3667 has expressed a keen interest in collaborating with Foundation personnel on fashion-related projects. Their ability to perceive colors beyond human range may prove useful in developing new camouflage technology. However, the emotional volatility exhibited by SCP-3667 must be taken into account when considering any interactions that may cause distress.
