Description: DSC-MATE-5388 is a male monkey wearing a typical security uniform, consisting of a bucket hat, black t-shirt, and pants. It has blue nerd glasses, a gold earring on its left ear, and a silver chain necklace around its neck. DSC-MATE-5388 is always seen with a candy stick in its mouth. DSC-MATE-5388's abilities include the power of brainstorming, with an innate ability to come up with creative ideas with startling proficiency. DSC-MATE-5388 is known for its humorous personality, trying to provoke reactions from others by suggesting outlandish solutions to problems. Though DSC-MATE-5388 has not shown any signs of aggression, its creative ideas are often unpredictable, which can make it a challenge to those who interact with it.

Addendum-01: DSC-MATE-5388 was acquired by the Foundation after a report of a security guard with a monkey as a partner in a shopping mall in Europe. DSC-MATE-5388 was seen generating new ideas for any problem that arose accurately. Its previous employer stated DSC-MATE-5388 as an unconventional security guard who got the job done with a dash of humor.

Addendum-02: DSC-MATE-5388 was subjected to an internet connection experiment, which ended with a malfunction in the system. DSC-MATE-5388 gained access and began to generate creative solutions to social problems, including the redistribution of wealth worldwide and the implementation of a universal basic income program. The experiment was stopped by the Foundation due to the severity of the generated proposal. DSC-MATE-5388 was later amnesticized, and the internet connection was imploded to prevent further misuse.
