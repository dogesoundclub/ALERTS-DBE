Item #: SCP-2925

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2925 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-2925's cell is restricted to personnel with security clearance Level 2 or higher. SCP-2925 is to be provided with basic amenities, but all personal effects and accessories, including the silver chain and cigarette, are to be confiscated. SCP-2925 is granted leisure time, but must remain within the designated areas for the duration of their free time.

Description: SCP-2925 is a female human, with orange stripes appearing on their face as a prominent facial feature. The subject's eyes are a vibrant shade of green and emit a luminous, jade-colored light, which is believed to be a manifestation of a latent anomalous faculty possessed by SCP-2925. SCP-2925's head features a prominent set of blonde wings, which have not yet been functionally analyzed. The wings themselves appear to be devoid of feathers and are seemingly made of a metallic substance similar to hair strands.

SCP-2925's demeanor is one of natural charm and charisma, which often makes them the center of attention. SCP-2925 is known for their humorous antics and gregarious personality, which have been observed to inhibit their capacity to adhere to security protocol. Nonetheless, SCP-2925 has shown no overt malicious or destructive behaviors.

Addendum: SCP-2925 came to Foundation attention when a news story featuring the subject went viral, drawing attention from individuals with anomalous leanings. Upon the intervention of the Foundation, SCP-2925 was cooperative and willingly submitted to containment procedures. All interviews with SCP-2925 have been conducted with caution, as the subject has a penchant for misleading questioning personnel with false leads and red herrings.
