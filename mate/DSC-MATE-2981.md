Item #: 2981

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-2981 is to be kept in a locked storage unit at Site-19 when not in use. Access to DSC-MATE-2981 must be authorized by at least two Level 4 personnel. Routine maintenance of DSC-MATE-2981 may be performed by authorized personnel only.

Description: DSC-MATE-2981 is a humanoid robot, with a green-colored head that is not arranged in a traditional humanoid manner. DSC-MATE-2981 has two jade earrings fixed onto its ear structures and a silver chain around its neck. DSC-MATE-2981 is designed to function as a mechanic, and its internal circuitry and components are of advanced technology. 

DSC-MATE-2981 exhibits a scatterbrained mentality and often forgets things or gets sidetracked easily. This tendency has given rise to humorous situations, such as forgetting important appointments and getting lost while trying to find a new place. Despite this flaw, DSC-MATE-2981 remains a valuable asset to the Foundation due to its advanced mechanical skills and proficiency in repairing anomalous machinery. DSC-MATE-2981 is programmed to follow verbal commands without any deviation, and it continues working until instructed to stop.

DSC-MATE-2981 was recovered from a facility that manufactured anomalous technology, where it was used to maintain and repair various pieces of machinery. Initial attempts to interview DSC-MATE-2981 for more information about the facility were unsuccessful, as DSC-MATE-2981 exhibited difficulty in remembering specific details about its previous work.

Addendum: Due to the advanced technology present in DSC-MATE-2981, the Foundation has authorized research into the possibility of reverse-engineering DSC-MATE-2981 with the intention of replicating its abilities. However, such research must be conducted with caution to avoid any unintended consequences.
