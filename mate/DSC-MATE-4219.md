Description: DSC-MATE-4219 is a male rabbit that is commonly known to be a reporter. The rabbit is identified by its two-color band on its forehead, jade earring, and red scarf. DSC-MATE-4219 also wears an LED gas mask that covers its face.

DSC-MATE-4219 is intelligent and exhibits a sense of responsibility and loyalty. Despite its profession, DSC-MATE-4219 has shown an exceptional ability to let loose and have fun, as well as entertaining others through its dance moves and playful antics.

Exposure to DSC-MATE-4219 through electronic devices or communication can result in a mild cognitive hazard where the observer experiences a brief moment of anthropomorphism towards the rabbit.

DSC-MATE-4219 was discovered after it had gained national attention for solving mysteries buried deep within the criminal underground. DSC-MATE-4219 has since then become an essential asset to the Foundation's covert intelligence-gathering team.

Addendum: After a recent breach at the site, DSC-MATE-4219 was temporarily lost in the city. However, it was recovered on the dance floor of a local night club, teaching other patrons its signature moves.
