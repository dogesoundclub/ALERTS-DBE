Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9456 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit. The unit must be outfitted with a microphone and speaker system at all times, allowing for communication between DSC-MATE-9456 and any personnel that may require interaction with the entity. An additional stipulation to DSC-MATE-9456's containment includes the provision of snack foods, with particular emphasis on candy sticks, which is to be made available to the entity on a daily basis.

Description: DSC-MATE-9456 is a humanoid entity measuring approximately 1.3 meters in height, with a physical appearance that resembles that of a monkey. The entity's most noticeable attributes include the possession of eccentric features such as a headset with LED lighting and a silver chain around its neck. Its eyes are consistently framed by a pair of thick nerd glasses.

DSC-MATE-9456 exhibits a personality that is often seen as playful and rebellious. It enjoys pushing boundaries and has a history of breaking rules or employing cunning tactics in order to achieve its objectives. It does not display any signs of aggression or danger, but care should be taken when dealing with DSC-MATE-9456 as it can be mischievous.

DSC-MATE-9456 presently holds the job of a Traffic Officer, and has been tasked with controlling the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in an urban metropolitan area. Despite exhibiting tendencies that might be considered counter-productive to effective rule-enforcement, its unique personality has made it an effective and efficient worker.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9456 has been found to possess a non-anomalous vendetta against certain motorists, which it displays through the implementation of increasingly specific and convoluted parking regulations. These regulations appear to be specifically targeted at the offending vehicles and owners, and contain subtle jabs at the owners' personalities or tastes. It is unknown what triggered this behavior, or whether it should be considered a risk to containment.
