Item #: SCP-9870

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9870 is to be confined to a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Any interactions between SCP-9870 and Foundation personnel are to be supervised by at least one armed guard. SCP-9870 is also prohibited from owning any gift-giving materials such as wrapping papers or ribbons.

Description: SCP-9870 is a human male of average height and weight, with green layers covering their head and blue clown eyes. SCP-9870 also possesses a unique physical feature, a mouth spot of unknown origin. The subject's ears are adorned with a cross earring that also appears in a shade of green. The humanoid also ties a red scarf around his neck as an accessory.

SCP-9870's primary anomalous characteristic is their ability to gift-giving with great detail and accuracy, often resulting in positive and lasting impacts on the recipients. This inherent talent appears to be closely linked to SCP-9870's observant nature and almost compulsive drive to give the "perfect" gift. Although this behavior is not inherently harmful, it has become somewhat of an obsession for SCP-9870, causing social awkwardness and occasional outbursts of frustration.

Interview logs reveal several instances where SCP-9870 struggled to identify the most suitable gift, often spending hours or even days researching and analyzing potential options. Although this behavior may appear harmless, staff members have noted a significant increase in anomalous activity surrounding SCP-9870's containment cell during these periods of extended isolation.

Addendum 9870-1: As of [REDACTED], SCP-9870 has expressed resistance to Foundation protocols, demanding access to gift-giving materials and complaining about the lack of opportunities to share their talent. Further research and analysis of SCP-9870's behavior are necessary to determine the best course of action.
