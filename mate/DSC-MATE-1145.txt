Subject 1145, also known as "The Jester," is an anomalous human possessing strikingly unique physical features. Her face is adorned with vibrant orange stripes, while her eyes bear the same hue in her eyebrows. Sporting a cheery smile and golden earrings, her overall appearance exudes a sense of playfulness and frivolity.

However, what truly sets 1145 apart is her unusual accessory - an LED Gas Mask - which glows with a multitude of colors, further emphasizing her boisterous and eccentric nature. 

Despite her unusual appearance, 1145 is known for her remarkable programming skills, often hailed as one of the most talented professionals in her field. This, coupled with her magnetic personality, makes her an indispensable asset to any team.

Subject 1145 is also renowned for her sense of humor, which can occasionally lead to unconventional approaches to problem-solving. Her knack for making others laugh, coupled with her sharp wit and quick thinking, has earned her the nickname "The Jester." 

However, 1145 occasionally needs to be reminded of the gravity of certain situations, which can pose a challenge when dealing with serious matters. Nonetheless, it is hard to imagine an urban fantasy plot without the colorful and charming addition of The Jester.
