Item #: SCP-3683

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3683 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with the addition of reinforced walls and a titanium mesh grate above the chamber. SCP-3683 is to be provided with a headset for communication purposes.

SCP-3683 is permitted access to a Fast Food restaurant within the facility, as it is cooperative during feeding times. Any other interactions with staff members are to be recorded for review.

Description: SCP-3683 is a male tiger of the species Panthera Tigris, standing approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 250 kilograms. Its mouth appears constantly frightened, and it wears a protective medical mask over its mouth.

SCP-3683's eyes appear as ski goggles, and it wears a purple cap with a headset for communication purposes. It wears a jade earring on one of its ears and a gold chain around its neck.

SCP-3683's personality is focused on independence, often refusing to ask for help even when it is required. This can result in humorous situations, such as moving heavy objects alone or being lost without a map.

SCP-3683's employment as a Fast Food worker is considered instrumental in maintaining its cooperation with Foundation personnel. However, its preference for independence must be monitored. Should SCP-3683 become uncooperative, staff are to immediately report to Site Director for containment measures. Any news of SCP-3683 without the supervision of the Foundation are to be dealt with accordingly.

Addendum: SCP-3683 was recovered during a raid on a traveling circus in ██████, Russia, after reports of an anthropomorphic tiger. It is believed to have been the result of an unknown genetic or radiation mutation. Investigation into this is ongoing.
