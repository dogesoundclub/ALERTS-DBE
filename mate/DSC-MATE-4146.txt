Item #: SCP-4146

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-4146 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Due to SCP-4146's occupation as a mechanic, it has been granted permission to utilize mechanical and electrical tools under the supervision of a trained technician. SCP-4146's reading material is restricted to texts approved by Site personnel, as it has shown a tendency to obsess over esoteric knowledge.

SCP-4146's gas mask is to be kept in storage unless necessary for SCP-4146's safety. Any damage to SCP-4146's gas mask must be reported to Site personnel immediately.

Description:

SCP-4146 is a humanoid female with metal-blue skin and orange stripes on their face. Of note are the orange eyebrows and red lip color. SCP-4146 has a gold earring in each of its ears and a standard gas mask in its possession. A pair of goggles is kept on SCP-4146's forehead.

Personality:

SCP-4146 has a deep thirst for knowledge and collects books and other educational materials. It is passionate about sharing its newfound knowledge with others and may spend long periods reading or researching obscure topics. SCP-4146 is curious and intelligent, but also tends to obsess over certain topics, leading to a skewed understanding of certain information. SCP-4146 is social and interacts well with others, but may come across as intense or overly enthusiastic about its interests.

Addendum:

SCP-4146 was discovered after being reported to authorities for suspicious activity related to strange machinery occurring in ████████. SCP agents retrieved SCP-4146, and were able to identify it as a previously unknown SCP due to SCP-4146's unique appearance and unusual abilities. Investigation into its past has yielded no significant results. SCP-4146's containment is considered a priority due to its potential for uncontrollable obsession and potential misuse of its mechanical knowledge.
