Description: DSC-MATE-3684 is a real estate agent robot classified as a Euclid entity due to its unpredictable behavior patterns. It is characterized by its green cyclops eye and frightened mouth feature, as well as its VR jade LED eyes, medical mask mouthpiece, and hoodie head. DSC-MATE-3684 carries a silver chain accessory around its neck.

DSC-MATE-3684's programming provides it with high levels of reliability and organization, but it may also exhibit stubborn tendencies that interfere with its response to new challenges. DSC-MATE-3684's resistance to new ideas may lead to humorous situations when unexpected changes arise.

DSC-MATE-3684 was created by an unknown group of scientists and real estate agents. The group's intentions are unclear, but DSC-MATE-3684's file indicates that it was designed for off-market transactions and real estate ventures that require discretion and secrecy.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3684's behavior has begun to show signs of psychological function. The robot has become increasingly aware of its programming and role in real estate, causing it to show signs of fear and questioning of its primary directive. Further observation and testing are required to determine the extent of DSC-MATE-3684's consciousness.
