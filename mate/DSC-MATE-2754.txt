Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2754 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Any interaction with SCP-2754 must be monitored by at least one Class-D personnel. SCP-2754 must not be given access to any form of communication with the outside world.

Description: SCP-2754 is a humanoid of the Homo sapiens species, identified as a male, with orange stripes on his face. SCP-2754 has red clown eyes and wears a blue bandana on his head. On his forehead, SCP-2754 wears a set of goggles. SCP-2754 also has a gold earring on his left ear and wears a red scarf and candy stick as accessories.

SCP-2754 displays a creative and inventive mindset, often enjoying brainstorming and coming up with unique ideas. These ideas can be humorous at times and can result in SCP-2754 suggesting outlandish solutions to problems.

SCP-2754 has been identified as a car salesman in his previous life, and it is believed that he used his inventive ideas to sell cars. However, due to SCP-2754's anomalous abilities, he poses a threat to society if given access to any form of communication. As a result, SCP-2754 is to be kept under tight supervision at all times.

Addendum: Further research into SCP-2754's abilities may reveal a use for his creative mindset that can benefit the Foundation. Until then, SCP-2754 is to remain in containment.
