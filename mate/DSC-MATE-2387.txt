Addendum: While 2387 does not pose any immediate threat to containment, it has been recommended that personnel exercise caution when interacting with him, as his sensitivity may cause him to inadvertently expose himself or others to harmful emotions. Personnel are advised to provide emotional stability and support to 2387 whenever needed.
