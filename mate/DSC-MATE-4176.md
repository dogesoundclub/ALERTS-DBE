Item #: 4176

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4176 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, and provided with an adequate supply of fruits and vegetables, as well as various grooming tools to maintain their physical appearance. They are permitted to work as a beautician in a secure salon under Foundation supervision, as this seems beneficial for both the subject and Foundation morale.

Description: 4176 is a male monkey, standing approximately 3 feet in height, with brown fur and brown eyes behind normal glasses. They have a distinctive two-color band on their forehead, and often wear a doge hat and a gold earring in one of their ears.

4176 is a remarkably skilled and perceptive beautician. They have an intuitive touch that allows them to identify the right hairstyle or makeup that would best suit a client. This intuition is said to be almost psychic and can border on creepy, as 4176 can predict future events or sense when someone is upset or anxious. Further research is needed to explain this strange phenomenon.

Personality: Despite being an animal, 4176 displays a high level of self-awareness and intelligence. They seem to take pride in their appearance and work, and often demand a certain level of respect from those who seek their services. 4176 is outgoing, sociable, and prefers the company of humans over their fellow monkeys.

Despite their friendly demeanor, 4176 can be unpredictable and is known to act out when frustrated, especially with unsatisfactory clients. Therefore, caution must be exercised around them. 

Conclusion: 4176 possesses remarkable abilities that could be of great value to the Foundation. However, we need to conduct further experiments to better understand their strange powers, and the implications they may have on the wider urban fantasy community. Until then, we must monitor and contain this monkey with great care.
