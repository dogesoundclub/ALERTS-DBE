Item #: 9577

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9577 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Due to the subject's animalistic nature, it is to be provided with a steady supply of meat for consumption. Medical staff should regularly monitor and maintain the subject's physical health. Interaction with personnel is strictly prohibited except during authorized testing and feeding schedules.

Description: Subject 9577 is a male Bengal tiger standing at 6'3" when standing upright. It is distinguishable by the blue bandana tied around its forehead with a pair of goggles perched atop. A gold earring adorns the subject's right ear. Its eyes are concealed behind a pair of glasses, which it relies on for clear vision.

Subject 9577 has demonstrated a deep sense of empathy and understanding towards others, often exhibiting emotional responses to individuals' pain and suffering. It has also exhibited a strong fondness for and connection to nature and wildlife. Despite its predatory instincts, it has never shown hostility towards those not deemed a threat.

Routine psychological evaluations have determined that subject 9577 may suffer from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder originating from its time in the wild before containment. In response to its apparent anxiety, the object has been given enrichments such as a small patch of earth and fake grass to allow it to indulge in its feral instincts.

Addendum: Due to its strong sense of empathy, the subject has been approved for future use in counseling sessions for traumatized individuals. Testing has yielded potential for counseling effects exceeding that of optimal SSRIs therapy. Further research into potential deployment scenarios as part of social support services within the Foundation is pending approval.
