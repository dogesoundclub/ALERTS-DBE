SCP-970 is a humanoid mechanic, designated as a member of the Homo sapiens species. This individual sports a striking set of orange stripes on their face, resembling the markings of a jungle cat. The most striking and unnerving feature, however, is the deep red clown-like eyes that seem to draw one in with a hypnotic gaze. Their head is styled in the popular 00s school girl fashion, harking back to an era of movies and music they seem inexplicably drawn to. Jade earrings complement their look, as does a choker and a cigarette.

While SCP-970 may not consider themselves to be the life of the party, their dry sense of humor often catches people off-guard. They have a knack for delivering deadpan jokes with impeccable timing, and have become known for their surprising wit. It is unclear if this tendency towards humor is a coping mechanism or simply a part of their personality. Nonetheless, SCP-970's wry humor has endeared them to some, while alienating others who find their detachment and apparent lack of emotion unsettling.
