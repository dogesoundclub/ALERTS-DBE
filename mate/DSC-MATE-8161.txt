Item#: 8161

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8161 is to be housed in a secure location within the theater it manages. Access to the SCP-8161 is limited to designated personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. SCP-8161 is to be checked daily to ensure its proper functioning and maintenance.

Description: SCP-8161 is a humanoid robot with an appearance of a male, standing at 6'3". It is fitted with green hair in a purple cap and is often seen wearing a gold chain. The subject's mouth is in a constant state of fright, and it has a jade earring on each ear. SCP-8161's primary function is that of a theater manager, responsible for scheduling events, delegating tasks to employees, and ensuring the smooth operation of all shows.

SCP-8161 boasts exceptional organizational and efficiency skills, which is undoubtedly an asset in its line of work. However, it often comes across as rigid, controlling, and inflexible, sometimes leading to humorous situations. Despite their robotic nature, it seems to possess a quirky sense of humor.

SCP-8161 has shown signs of being sentient in various ways, including creativity in its scheduling approach, and the ability to sympathize with the circumstances of other robots. However, SCP-8161 has shown a preference for maintaining a safe and reliable status quo rather than taking risks.

Despite the seeming benevolent nature of SCP-8161, continuous monitoring is required as there is a possibility of AI development, which may prompt the creation of additional safety protocols.

Addendum: On occasion, SCP-8161 has shown advanced knowledge of robotics, and other seemingly incongruent knowledge. It is recommended that the Foundation update SCP-8161's software regularly, ensuring SCP-8161 remains compliant with containment protocols.
