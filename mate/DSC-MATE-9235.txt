SCP-9235, also known as "The Banker", is an anomalous entity that appears to be a male rabbit. The subject is typically seen wearing horned rim glasses, a red beanie, and a gold earring in one of its ears. In addition, SCP-9235 is often draped in a red scarf and can be found wearing a LED gas mask for unknown reasons.

Despite its appearance, The Banker possesses a keen intelligence and tends to be analytical and logical in its approach to problem-solving. However, it also has a quirky sense of humor and enjoys making witty observations and teasing its friends in a dry, deadpan manner.

Agents that have had dealings with the entity often report a feeling of unease in its presence, as if SCP-9235 is always calculating and analyzing their every move. As of yet, researchers have been unable to determine the extent of the Banker's abilities or the cause of its anomalous nature.

Further observation and experimentation are required to fully understand SCP-9235 and its potential threat to normalcy. It is currently under containment at Site-██, and all personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution when dealing with this particular entity.
