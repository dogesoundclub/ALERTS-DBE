Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4131 is to be monitored at all times to ensure their compliance with Foundation directives. Adequate space and food provisions are to be provided for their physical wellbeing. In the event that Subject 4131's abilities are needed, Foundation personnel are to approach with caution, as they may become agitated if they feel threatened.

Description: Subject 4131 appears to be a male rabbit, standing approximately 2 feet tall on two legs. They possess a distinctive feature of blue clown-like eyes that have been observed to change color depending on the situation. They often don a police cap atop their head and a jade earring on one of their ears, adding to their eccentric appearance. They also wear a bright red scarf around their neck, which has been noted to have no practical use.
