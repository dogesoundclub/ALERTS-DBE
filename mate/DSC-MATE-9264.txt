Item #: SCP-9264

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9264 is to be monitored at all times through surveillance footage and a GPS tracking device. Any anomalous behavior is to be immediately reported to Site-██. SCP-9264 is permitted to continue working as a delivery driver under the pretext of our front company. All packages delivered by SCP-9264 are to be inspected for any anomalies before being sent to their final destination.

Description: SCP-9264 is a female human with green hair and a purple cap. She always wears a medical mask over her mouth, and normal glasses over her eyes. SCP-9264's most prominent feature is her red lipstick, and the two-color band on her forehead. A pair of goggles is also always present on her forehead, positioned between the two-color band.

SCP-9264 is observed to be unusually attentive to details, often spending an excessive amount of time worrying about the "perfect" item to give someone as a gift. She is particularly skilled at selecting gifts that appear to be handpicked for the recipient, despite her lack of knowledge about the individual. SCP-9264 also wears a gold chain as a personal accessory, which is often commented on by her colleagues.

It is suspected that SCP-9264 possesses anomalous abilities that aid her in her gift-giving. Further investigation is necessary to determine the nature and extent of these abilities, and whether they pose any danger to the Foundation's goals.

Addendum: SCP-9264 was flagged for containment following reports of strange and occasionally unexplainable events surrounding the packages she delivered. These events include packages arriving at their destination earlier or later than expected, spontaneous damage to packages, and instances where one package was split into multiple copies that arrived at different destinations. While it is currently unclear if SCP-9264 is directly responsible for these events, continued monitoring is necessary to minimize potential risks to the public.
