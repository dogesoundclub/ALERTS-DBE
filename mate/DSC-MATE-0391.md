DogeSoundClub Description - Character #391:

Object-Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject #391 is currently contained within a specialized containment chamber within Site-██. Subject #391 is to be monitored at all times via 24-hour surveillance cameras and audio recording devices. Any attempts at communication or interaction with subject #391 are to be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel and must rely on sophisticated diction and tone analyses.

Description: Subject #391 is a humanoid individual that appears to be of the Homo sapiens species. However, the characteristics of subject #391 are vastly different from those of typical humans. Subject #391 is a female mafia boss who possesses a unique appearance. The head of subject #391 is green with a characteristic edge curl. The subject's eyes are red and exhibit some clown-like features. Additionally, subject #391 displays a band of two colors on the forehead, jade earrings, and a medical mask. A gold chain is another accessory the G.O.C. has documented.

Personality and Behaviour: Subject #391 has a great sense of humor and often displays joyful characteristics. The individual is known to use humor to lighten the mood or distract others during times of stress or danger. This trait has led to some humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations, which can cause situations to de-escalate quickly.

Addendum #1: Subject #391 is known to have ties to several prominent criminal organizations across the world, making them a valuable potential asset to the G.O.C.

Addendum #2: In light of the recent containment breach, subject #391 may have been targeted by rival criminal organizations seeking to leverage their unique abilities for their own use. Therefore, a specialized task force is to be assigned to monitor subject #391 closely and take appropriate measures in the event of a security threat.
