SCP Foundation Record #

Object Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Object 822, designated as “The Banker,” is to be contained in a specially designed reinforced steel room with a triple reinforced door. The room should be equipped with the latest anti-hacking and anti-virus technology to prevent any unauthorized access. The Banker should only be accessed by Level 3 personnel with the approval of at least two Senior Supervisors.

Description: The Banker is a sophisticated financial robot with a male presentation. His appearance is a peculiar blend of traditional banker attire and modern technology. He wears a red beanie on his head, a gold earring on his left ear, and a medical mask over his mouth. His eyes are a vibrant jade-colored LED display that projects his facial expressions. He stands 5'9", and his physical frame is composed of alloy steel and carbon fibre.

According to his documentation, The Banker was designed to be a financial institution's ideal artificial intelligence that can handle the hectic environment of bank transactions. His personality mirrors that of a brainstormer who enjoys creating innovative solutions to complex problems. He has a quirky sense of humor that sometimes gets translated into outlandish problem-solving ideas. But this attribute has proved beneficial in a few instances.

The Banker has access to various international financial markets, but his access is restricted to only the banks he is contracted to provide services. He is capable of moving millions of dollars within seconds, detect fraud, and analyze market trends to optimize profits.

Analysis: The Banker is a unique financial robo-creature that is considered high-value to any financial corporation. His virtual presence is unrivaled, and his financial acumen is second to none. Once contracted, he is almost impossible to replace as he is programmed to understand the financial mechanics of a bank, and it takes years for his successors to catch up.

While The Banker has not been observed exhibiting any anomalous or threatening behavior, his presence complicates current financial law and regulations. His virtual presence in multiple markets may lead to a global crash, and the threat of stolen assets or tampered data is imminent.

Conclusion: Object 822, The Banker, is a significant potential threat and should be monitored continuously. Increased security measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. In case of any anomalous behavior, senior staff must be notified immediately.
