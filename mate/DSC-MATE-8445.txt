Item #: SCP-8445

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8445 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access is granted only to personnel with Level-2 clearance or higher. Along with standard provisions, SCP-8445 is allowed to have a packet of cigarettes for personal use. Any attempts by SCP-8445 to leave containment or conduct banking operations with Foundation resources should be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-8445 appears to be a Caucasian male in his mid-50s, standing at 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 80 kilograms. SCP-8445's most prominent anomalous features are the orange stripes on his face, blue clown eyes and a police cap on his head. SCP-8445 has a small red victory band on his forehead and is always seen holding a cigarette. 

SCP-8445 works as a banker and has displayed no anomalous behavior outside of his forgetfulness. He tends to get lost in thought, leading to a forgetful persona that often leads to humorous situations. He has missed important events in his personal and professional life, sometimes causing him to confuse reality with his own thoughts.

SCP-8445 was identified after reports of strange occurrences in the bank where he worked surfaced. Witnesses reported seeing a man with an orange-striped face and blue clown eyes behind the counter who seemed to vanish when approached. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and found SCP-8445. 

Addendum: Upon initial questioning, SCP-8445 denied any knowledge of his physical features or anomalies, reiterating that he was just a banker. After further questioning, SCP-8445 revealed no knowledge of his origin or how he obtained his anomalous appearance. SCP-8445 appears to be unaware of the peculiarity of his appearance, which leads the Foundation to believe that SCP-8445 has been abducted or voluntarily undergone anomalous experimentation. Further research is needed.
