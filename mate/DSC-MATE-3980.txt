SCP-3980, also known as "The Green Headed Car Salesman", is a male human with distinct spots on his face and a perpetual smile. His head is covered in layers of an unknown green substance, which seem to shift and move as a result of his emotions. Due to this, he always wears a medical mask to hide his appearance from the public.

SCP-3980 is a consummate salesperson, with a natural charm and charisma that make him the life of the party. He often tells jokes and performs silly dances to make others laugh, using these skills to close deals and sway even the most skeptical customer. Despite his jovial demeanor, he has a shrewd mind for business and is not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get what he wants.

SCP-3980 is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck, a symbol of his success and status within the world of car sales. He takes great pride in his appearance and enjoys showing off his expensive suits and designer accessories.

While SCP-3980 may seem like a harmless and likable person, there is something unsettling about his appearance and personality that puts some people off. There are reports of customers feeling strangely hypnotized or manipulated after dealing with him, and some claim to have seen his head take on an even more otherworldly appearance under certain circumstances.

Overall, SCP-3980 is a fascinating and potentially dangerous individual, with a unique blend of charm, business acumen, and unknown abilities. He should be approached with caution and under strict supervision at all times.
