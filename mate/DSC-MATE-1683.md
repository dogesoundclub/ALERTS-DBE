Addendum:

DSC-MATE-1683 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after a series of peculiar reports cropped up on a well-known news channel. Due to an anonymous tip-off, agents soon discovered that DSC-MATE-1683 was behind all the reports, and she was apprehended without much resistance.

Several attempts at amnestics have only resulted in temporary memory loss for DSC-MATE-1683, with full recall returning within several days to a week. Due to the difficulties in any long-term brainwashing, all attempts at amnestics have been suspended until further notice.
