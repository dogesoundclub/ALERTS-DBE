Item #: SCP-8802

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8802 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-██. Due to its ability to speak and potentially cause harm, it is to be monitored at all times via a two-way communication system. SCP-8802 is to be fed a diet of fresh vegetables, fruits, and water twice daily, along with other necessary supplements as prescribed by a veterinary doctor. Any injuries or illnesses observed are to be immediately reported and treated as needed.

Description: SCP-8802 is a male rabbit of the Leporidae family, measuring one meter in height when standing on its hind legs. Its face features a perpetually frightened expression, with droopy cheeks and a wide-open mouth. SCP-8802 wears horned rim glasses on its two small, beady eyes and a red beanie on its head. It also has a jade earring on its left ear and a red scarf around its neck. It carries a whistle as an accessory, which it uses to perform its job as a police officer.

SCP-8802 possesses a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which often leads it to take on more tasks than it can handle. It gets easily overwhelmed and has a tendency to try and carry too many things at once, leading to humorous situations for onlookers. Despite this, SCP-8802 is a diligent worker and takes its job as a police officer seriously. It performs its duties with great care and attention to detail, always striving to ensure the safety of the public and its fellow officers.

Addendum 8802-A: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8802 was tested for any anomalous properties. It was found that SCP-8802 possessed the ability to communicate telepathically with other rabbits in a five-meter radius. Testing of this ability is ongoing to determine its potential usefulness in future containment breaches or other situations where communication with small animals may be necessary.
