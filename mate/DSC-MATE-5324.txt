SCP-5324, designated as a Villain, is a male monkey with unknown eye color. It possesses a distinct Police Cap adorning its head, along with a unique 2-color band on its forehead and goggles resting on it. Notably, SCP-5324 has a silver chain as its only accessory.

Its personality type suggests that it is an outgoing and social animal, often seeking attention and craving the spotlight. SCP-5324 has displayed a knack for conveying amusing stories and jokes, capable of eliciting laughter and mirth from those in its vicinity.

However, this apparent friendly countenance conceals a more sinister nature, equipping SCP-5324 with a deceitful and malicious streak. Its capabilities to cause harm to unsuspecting targets have been observed to be extensive and varied, and the Foundation advises utmost precaution in its handling.

Any interaction with SCP-5324 must be conducted with a complete understanding of its duplicitous tendencies, as it is known to exploit trust to achieve its own ends. Being in the midst of SCP-5324's machinations can spell disaster for the unprepared, as its humor and charm can be a deadly weapon in the wrong hands.
