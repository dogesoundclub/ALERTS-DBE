Item #: 2049

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2049 is to be contained in a modified humanoid containment unit at Site-██. The unit must be furnished with natural plant life and sufficient space for the subject to move around. The subject is to be provided with a daily supply of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Subject 2049 is not to be allowed to interact with other SCPs unless authorized by Level 3 personnel. Any unauthorized interaction with personnel or other SCPs is strictly prohibited.

Description: Subject 2049 is a male monkey who works as a fast food worker. It wears a bucket hat on its head and a jade earring on its left ear. It often wears a gold chain around its neck and smokes cigarettes.

Despite being a monkey, subject 2049 possesses a deep empathy and understanding for others. It is often moved to tears or emotional outbursts when it witnesses someone else's pain or suffering. It also shows a fondness for animals and nature, frequently spending time with the plants in its containment unit.

Subject 2049 is capable of communicating through sign language and has displayed above-average intelligence, suggesting it has undergone some form of anomalous mutation or augmentation.

Addendum: Subject 2049 was discovered in a fast food restaurant in ████████, where it was working as an employee. Witnesses reported that the monkey had been trained to perform various tasks, including taking orders and cooking food. Foundation operatives recovered the subject and brought it into containment.

Further investigation revealed that the restaurant chain had been experimenting with anomalous mutations on their animal employees. The chain was promptly shut down, and all remaining subjects were contained by the Foundation.

Note from Dr. ██████: Despite its appearance, subject 2049 exhibits human-like emotions and communication abilities. It is imperative that we continue to monitor its mental state and emotional stability to prevent any potential containment breaches.
