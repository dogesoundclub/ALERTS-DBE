Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1303 is to be housed in a standard human containment chamber with appropriate safety and monitoring measures. Surfaces within the chamber must be made of materials not susceptible to corrosion, as contact with subject 1303's body often results in significant degradation. No human subjects are to be allowed within a 50-foot radius of subject 1303 without approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. 

Description: Subject 1303 is a human female of unknown age, approximately 5'6" in height. Subject 1303 possesses several unusual physical features, including orange stripes on their cheeks, purple lips, and orange eyebrows. Their head is a distinctive metal blue color, and they are often observed wearing a pair of goggles on their forehead. Subject 1303 also wears a green cross earring in their left ear. 

Subject 1303 is a licensed veterinarian with a somewhat reclusive personality, tending to spend extended periods lost in thought or daydreaming. Despite this, they have demonstrated a keen intellect and a deep understanding of animal behavior. Subject 1303's unique physical traits and introspective nature have led to a series of humorous mishaps, including several incidents of walking into objects or tripping while lost in thought.

Addendum: Results of ongoing observation and testing indicate that subject 1303's physical traits and unusual psychology may be linked to a latent supernatural element. Further testing is required to confirm and understand the nature of this connection.
