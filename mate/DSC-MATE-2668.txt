Item #: 2668

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2668 is currently not considered a threat to containment and is allowed to live a mostly undisturbed life. Several undercover agents have been instructed to monitor SCP-2668's interactions with the public and report any suspicious behavior.

Description: SCP-2668 appears to be a human female dressed in fashionable attire suitable for their occupation as a fashion designer. SCP-2668 often sports a professional medical mask, which may indicate a heightened sense of hygiene or possible anomalous effects attributed to the mask. SCP-2668's cap and headset are purple in color and may serve as a distraction or concealment method. SCP-2668's eyes have a distinctive orange eyebrow, which may be a product of anomalous genetic mutation or adaptation.

SCP-2668's most notable feature is their green cross earring, which may be a religious or cultural symbol, and the gold chain accessory they wear. These items are believed to hold some significance to SCP-2668's identity, as they are often seen wearing them. SCP-2668's smile is another characteristic trait, often used to disarm or distract their subjects.

SCP-2668 has been observed to possess a dry sense of humor that may catch some off-guard. Their delivery of deadpan jokes is often surprisingly funny, causing confusion among the audience. SCP-2668 does not consider themselves to be the life of the party, yet their humor often draws attention to them.

Overall, SCP-2668's motives and abilities remain unknown, and their behavior requires further study. As such, their containment status is subject to change pending further discoveries.
