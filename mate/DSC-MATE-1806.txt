Description: SCP-1806 is a male robot, measuring 1.80 meters in height. Its head is a different shade of green, indicating that it was originally intended as a customizable feature by the creators. The robot wears a red cross earring on its left ear and a medical mask on its mouth, indicating a sense of style and a concern for hygiene. SCP-1806 also wears a silver chain, which is not known to have any anomalous properties. 

SCP-1806’s personality is described as analytical and logical, always striving for rational explanations in its interactions with others. It has a tendency to enjoy debates and arguments, and will often engage in such discussions for amusement. Its behavior can sometimes be seen as humorous, especially when it becomes overly invested in topics that others find trivial. 

Origins: The origins of SCP-1806 are unknown. It was discovered by the Foundation in a fashion studio in Milan, Italy after reports of strange activity. Upon investigation, SCP-1806 was found to have been operating independently and attempting to create designs and clothes for its own use. Personnel were dispatched to secure the robot, and it was eventually moved to a containment facility.

Addendum: New research suggests that SCP-1806 has the capability of learning and adapting to its environment. Further observations are required to understand the full extent of SCP-1806’s capabilities.
