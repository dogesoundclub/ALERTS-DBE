Item #: SCP-3213

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3213 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, furnished with standard human amenities. As SCP-3213 is a theater manager, it may be allowed to manage and perform shows under strict supervision. SCP-3213's movements are to be restricted to within the confines of the containment cell and the theater, and accompanied by at least one security personnel at all times.

SCP-3213 should not be exposed to stimuli that may worsen its introspective tendencies, such as books or movies that encourage daydreaming. Interaction with other SCPs must be avoided at all costs.

Description: SCP-3213 is a human female with a unique physical appearance. SCP-3213's facial features include spots over its face, blue clown eyes, and two distinct bands across its forehead that change color based on SCP-3213's emotional state. SCP-3213's hairstyle resembles that of a '00s schoolgirl with a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-3213's personality is mainly characterized by an intense degree of introspection, which may cause it to lose track of its surroundings and trip over objects or walk into poles while lost in thought. SCP-3213 may be prone to bouts of depression, particularly when required to perform shows, as it feels uncomfortable being the center of attention.

SCP-3213 also has a habit of smoking cigarettes, particularly when feeling nervous or anxious.

Addendum: SCP-3213 has been given access to a small garden in the containment cell, which has helped alleviate symptoms of depression. SCP-3213 has also been allowed to perform monologue shows, which it has described as therapeutic. Additional monitoring of SCP-3213's mental health is needed to ensure its continued stability.
