SCP-9300 is a male tiger of unknown origins with piercing red clown eyes that seem to stare deep into the soul of those who dare to come near. With his head not quite arranged in its usual furrowed manner, SCP-9300 carries himself with a quiet confidence that can be felt in the air around him. A red victory band adorns his forehead, signifying his tumultuous past as a fearsome Mafia Boss.

Further adding to his intimidating image, SCP-9300 also sports a red cross earring with a slight glint, appearing to almost meld with his fur. This feature is speculated to have some deeper meaning, possibly related to his past affiliations, but little is currently known about its significance.

Despite his fearsome appearance, SCP-9300 possesses a love for adventure that often leads him to take on risky endeavors and new experiences. His carefree personality has led to many humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness. While he may be feared in the underworld, those fortunate enough to see SCP-9300 in his more relaxed state would be amazed by his affable nature.
