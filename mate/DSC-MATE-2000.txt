Item #: 2000

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2000, currently identified as a male rabbit, is safely contained within Site-██'s living quarters with a standard rabbit hutch with additional beddings, foods, and toys, and must be monitored during its 12-hour shift as a security guard. It must be fed twice daily and given standard veterinarian care such as routine check-ups and vaccination. The subject’s red scarf and whistle are to be kept in a storage locker located in the guard’s station during the individual's security shifts.

Description: SCP-2000 is a sentient rabbit that stands at 27.9 cm and weighs 2.72 kg. The rabbit has a visibly frightened expression and a black ski goggle covering its eyes. It often wears a red scarf around its neck and a gold earring in its left ear. SCP-2000 uses a whistle to alert security officers of unauthorized incursions in its designated area.

SCP-2000 is a practical and hands-on creature, frequently exhibiting problem-solving skills and resourcefulness, often resolving issues in non-conventional ways using everyday objects such as duct tape or paper clips.

Despite the subject's seemingly timid demeanor, it demonstrates exceptional proficiency in performing its duties as a security guard, as it can detect potential threats quickly and effectively respond to them. SCP-2000 displays exceptional bravery when the situation calls for it but can be unpredictable when its personal space is intruded upon or its red scarf is mishandled.

Addendum: SCP-2000 was acquired after a report from a farmer in Northern Alaska claiming their pet rabbit had foiled an attempted arson attack on their farmhouse. The Foundation was notified and successfully retrieved the anomalous subject without incident. SCP-2000 has served as an asset to the security team ever since, earning it a commendation for bravery during an attempted site breach.
