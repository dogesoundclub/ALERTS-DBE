Item #: DSC-MATE-8857

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-8857 is to be contained in a soundproofed cell at Site-███. Daily feedings are to be administered by Level 2 personnel wearing sound-dampening ear protection. DSC-MATE-8857 is not to be allowed to interact with any personnel beyond this scope. No recording devices are allowed within DSC-MATE-8857's cell.

Description: DSC-MATE-8857 is a human male, identified as a news anchor for ████ News. DSC-MATE-8857 possesses several anomalous characteristics, including orange stripes on his face, blue clown eyes, green hair in a purple cap, and jade earring on his left ear. DSC-MATE-8857's most notable characteristic is the medical mask he wears over his mouth, claiming it as a preventive measure against the infection. However, DSC-MATE-8857's speech patterns suggest otherwise.

DSC-MATE-8857 has a natural affinity for brainstorming and comes up with creative ideas frequently. His creativity, coupled with his anomalous behavior, can lead to humorous situations, including suggesting outlandish solutions to problems to see how others react. Personnel interacting with DSC-MATE-8857 must exercise caution, as his verbal suggestions can have unforeseeable effects.

DSC-MATE-8857's presence can also affect objects within his vicinity. Unexplained objects, such as silver chains, appear on DSC-MATE-8857's body seemingly without cause. These objects tend to be low-grade valuables, but they can be significant enough to distract staff, which makes DSC-MATE-8857 an escape risk.

Additional Notes: In tests to determine DSC-MATE-8857's abilities, strange effects have occurred. When a Level 3 researcher asked DSC-MATE-8857 about the best way to contain him, DSC-MATE-8857 replied: "Why don't you jump into a volcano? That might contain me," moments before Site-███ experienced an earthquake. It is unknown if DSC-MATE-8857 caused these effects; further testing is required.
