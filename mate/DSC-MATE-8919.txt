Item #: 8919

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 8919, also known as the Delivery Driver, is to be monitored at all times. Any erratic or unusual behavior must be reported to the Foundation immediately. It is advised to approach with caution, as the subject may exhibit dominant behavior.

Description: Subject 8919 is a human male with spotted facial features, notably a frightened mouth. Their eyes are replaced with virtual reality jade LEDs, and they often wear a red beanie atop their head. A green cross earring adorns their ears, and a silver chain is worn as an accessory.

Personality-wise, subject 8919 possesses natural leadership abilities and often takes control of situations, even in their personal life. It is unknown if this is an inherent trait or an effect of their anomalous condition, and further research is required.

It is advised to approach the subject with caution, as their behavior may be unpredictable, especially when in charge. Extreme caution is advised, as any attempt to remove the LED eyes may trigger aggressive behavior. 

Provided that the subject complies with Foundation regulations and displays no unusual behavior, they may continue their duties as a delivery driver. The Foundation believes that their daily routine and interaction with the general populace help maintain a level of normalcy and conceal their anomalous nature.

Under no circumstances should Subject 8919 be allowed to leave Foundation grounds or interact with members outside of the Foundation without prior approval from high ranking personnel. Failure to comply will result in immediate measures to prevent SCP-8919 from leaving.
