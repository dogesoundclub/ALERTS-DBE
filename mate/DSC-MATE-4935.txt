Item #: SCP-4935

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4935 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Due to SCP-4935's profession as a real estate agent, it is permitted to engage in sales activities with the general public while accompanied by at least two armed guards. Any attempted escape or aggressive behavior is to be met with lethal force.

Description: SCP-4935 is a male tiger humanoid, standing at 2.3 meters in height and weighing approximately 180kg. SCP-4935's eyes emit a rainbow LED light which appear to emit a low-level radiation when viewed with high-tech equipment. SCP-4935 is regularly seen wearing a doge hat, gold chain and a normal gas mask. SCP-4935 is able to speak English fluently and exhibits characteristics of a human, such as the ability to walk on two legs and use and understand human technology.

SCP-4935 possesses an artistic side, which manifests in numerous ways, including creative writing, painting, and music production. When engaged in these activities, SCP-4935 exhibits an increased level of contentment and will occasionally share its creations with its captors or other SCP-affected humanoid specimens.

SCP-4935 appears to possess above-average intelligence and social awareness, which is reflected in its reputation among its peers in the anomalous community. SCP-4935 is known to have connections to criminal organizations and has repeatedly been observed in the vicinity of other dangerous SCP specimens, indicating the possibility of SCP-4935 trading its services for favors with other organizations.

Addendum 1: Despite numerous attempts, SCP-4935's origin and previous life remain shrouded in mystery. SCP-4935 has shown no signs of aggression or harm towards Foundation personnel unless provoked, making it unclear why it has been previously targeted for capture.

Addendum 2: SCP-4935 has recently requested a canvas and paint supplies to create a new piece. Its request is currently under review by site staff.
