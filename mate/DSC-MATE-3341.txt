Item #: SCP-3341

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3341 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber with restricted access. Any requests from SCP-3341 must be approved by at least one Level 3 personnel. SCP-3341 is allowed to perform its job as a delivery driver within Site-██, under supervision of at least one Foundation security personnel.

Description: SCP-3341 appears to be a human male with orange stripes on his face and a frightened mouth. He wears nerd glasses and a gas mask, along with a silver chain and a gold earring. There is a goggle on his forehead that he uses to observe his surroundings.

SCP-3341 has a not arranged green head, which is unusual for the human species. He has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, as well as a keen sense of humor that can lead to a lighthearted atmosphere. SCP-3341 is able to make others dance or sing along to his favorite songs, making him a great party host.

SCP-3341's deliveries have always been on time and accurate, leading the Foundation to trust him as a valuable asset. However, further observation is required to determine if there are any anomalous properties to his abilities as a delivery driver.

Addendum: SCP-3341 has requested permission to bring his pet cat into his containment chamber. After approval from Level 3 personnel, SCP-3341's pet cat was subjected to standard SCP testing procedures and was determined to be non-anomalous. SCP-3341 has been allowed to keep his pet cat in his containment chamber as long as it does not cause any disturbances.
