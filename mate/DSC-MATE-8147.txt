Item #: SCP-8147

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8147 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, with walls made of reinforced steel and monitored by both video and audio surveillance at all times. Any interaction with SCP-8147 must be approved by Level 3 personnel or higher. 

SCP-8147 is permitted to continue their job as a car salesman, as this provides a sense of normalcy and reduces the risk of containment breach or panic. SCP-8147 must be accompanied by at least one designated security personnel at all times during work hours. 

Description: SCP-8147 is a human female of average height, with orange stripes on their face and red lips. They wear their black hair in two pig tails and often keep a pair of goggles on their forehead. SCP-8147's ears are pierced, and they frequently wear gold earrings. SCP-8147 consistently wears a medical mask, which they claim is for hygiene purposes. 

SCP-8147 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility, particularly towards their job as a car salesman. However, they also possess a playful and humorous personality, surprising others with their dance moves and silly antics at social events. SCP-8147 has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with Foundation protocols and has not shown any indication of malicious intent or supernatural abilities. 

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-8147 was involved in an altercation with a customer, resulting in significant property damage and the activation of local law enforcement. During the incident, SCP-8147's mask was removed, revealing an anomalous property. Any individual who makes direct eye contact with SCP-8147 experiences a temporary loss of depth perception, making them unable to accurately judge distances. Further testing is needed to determine the extent of this property and any potential risks it may pose.
