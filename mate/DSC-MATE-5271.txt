Item #: 5271

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5271 is currently working as a beautician at a salon in ████████. He has been instructed to report any anomalous behavior or activity that he may encounter during his work hours to the Foundation immediately.

Description: SCP-5271 is a human male with a distinctive face marked by spots and a permanent smile. He wears thick-rimmed nerd glasses over his eyes and a colorful Doge hat on his head. Additionally, he has a jade earring in each ear and a two-color band across his forehead.

SCP-5271 has a very outgoing and independent personality, often refusing to ask for help even when such assistance is needed. This trait can result in amusing and sometimes dangerous situations, such as attempting to move heavy furniture alone or stubbornly rejecting the use of a map when lost.

SCP-5271's anomalous properties have not been fully explored, but so far, he has shown no signs of hostile or harmful behavior. It is suspected that his traits are simply reflective of a unique, but non-threatening psyche.

Addendum: SCP-5271 has been observed to have significant influence over the hairstyles and fashion choices of his clients, possibly indicating a latent ability to compel or manipulate individuals using his powers of persuasion. This potential effect is being monitored closely, and additional testing will be necessary to confirm if SCP-5271 presents a danger to the general public.
