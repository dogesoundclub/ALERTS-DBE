SCP-9347 is a male rabbit of unknown origin standing at approximately 2 feet tall. He is adorned with a red beanie hat on his head and a gold earring in his left ear. His frightened mouth and ordinary glasses complement his curious personality. SCP-9347 can usually be seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle around his neck as he goes about his job as a theater manager.

SCP-9347 displays a deep fascination with the world around him, often delving into obscure and arcane topics both academic and otherwise. He can be prone to spontaneously sharing these factual tidbits with those around him, much to their delight or irritation. He has been known to go on rambling academic tangents that can go on for minutes, leaving others scratching their heads in astonishment.

SCP-9347's access to the theater affords him a degree of comfort, and he is typically quite content in his role as manager. Despite his forthrightness, SCP-9347 can be rather skittish at times, reacting with great alarm to even the slightest of perceived threats. Anyone in close quarters with SCP-9347 may be caught off guard as the rabbit darts from one point to another with great speed to avoid danger.

Despite his penchant for curiosity, SCP-9347's playful and carefree demeanor makes him a valued member of the team, and his enthusiasm for the job is contagious. Those who work with him often find themselves entertained and enlightened by his off-beat interests and fun-loving attitude. Nonetheless, handlers should be encouraged to keep SCP-9347's more energetic impulses in check to avoid embarrassing or uncomfortable situations.
