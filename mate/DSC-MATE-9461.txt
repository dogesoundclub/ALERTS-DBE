Item #: SCP-9461

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9461 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be secured with reinforced steel and equipped with two-way mirrors to allow for constant observation. SCP-9461 is not allowed any form of interaction with any personnel within Site-██.

Description: SCP-9461 is a male human, appearing to be in his mid-40s with numerous spots covering his face. SCP-9461's mouth is distinctly clown-like in appearance, with red and white striped lips and a large ball-shaped nose. SCP-9461's eyes are bright blue with an oversized iris, typical of clown make-up. SCP-9461's head is cleanly shaven, resembling a monk, while a jade earring is present on his left ear.

SCP-9461's personality is unique in comparison to any known human of its classification. Their natural talent for leadership often leads them to take charge of any situation, whether at work or in their personal life. Word of SCP-9461's presence can lead individuals to seek his guidance expertly. SCP-9461 shows no signs of adopting a clown persona, and often resists the temptation to make humorous comments or jokes despite his appearance.

SCP-9461 possesses increased physical strength, endurance, and agility compared to the average human. While SCP-9461 has not expressed any desire to harm any Foundation personnel, it is noted that containment breaches or potential threats from other SCP's have triggered SCP-9461's protective instincts.

Addendum: SCP-9461 was discovered after reports of a "clown security guard" at an abandoned carnival caught the Foundation's attention. Foundation agents encountered SCP-9461 attempting to prevent a group of teenagers from entering a haunted attraction ride, demonstrating an authoritative demeanor with the group. SCP-9461 has since been secured and contained by Foundation personnel.
