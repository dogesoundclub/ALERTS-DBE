Item#: 8174

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8174 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not on duty. All maintenance work should be carried out by trained personnel, and any mechanical issues addressed immediately should they arise. Routine checks of SCP-8174's memory banks must be undertaken to ensure that it is not developing any behavioral anomalies that may put Foundation personnel at risk.

Description:

SCP-8174 is a Traffic Officer Entity constructed entirely out of metal and other artificial materials, which measures approximately 1.8 meters in height. SCP-8174 has a bucket hat on its head and a jade earring in its left ear. The entity's eyes are equipped with normal glasses, and its mouth is concealed behind a medical mask. SCP-8174 is also characterized by its silver chain.

Personality:

SCP-8174 is a highly autonomous machine with an independent nature, which has led to instances of disobedience when dealing with senior officers. Although displaying excellent judgment in its duties, it is not beyond sneaking out of the office early or taking time off without authorization. SCP-8174 is not easily controlled and often resists authority or rules but makes an excellent addition to the Foundation’s robotic workforce.

Addendum 8174-A:

SCP-8174 was recovered from ████████ City during an incident that began when an individual reported sightings of a metallic figure controlling traffic signals. In cooperation with the local police department, Foundation agents were dispatched to the area and located SCP-8174 in the center of an intersection. SCP-8174 was then tranquilized and transported to Site-██. Investigation into the incident is ongoing.
