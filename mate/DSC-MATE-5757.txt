Item #: SCP-5757

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5757 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. Any unauthorized interaction with SCP-5757 is strictly prohibited. SCP-5757 is allowed access to standard human amenities and must be given regular medical check-ups.

Description: SCP-5757 is a female human, identified as an electrician by profession. SCP-5757 possesses several anomalous physical features, including red clown eyes and a green head with edge curl. A two-color band can be seen on SCP-5757's forehead feature #1, while a green cross earring adorns her ears. SCP-5757 wears a silver chain as her accessory.

SCP-5757 also exhibits a strong sense of empathy, allowing her to understand and connect with the emotions of others. She has been observed to use this ability to comfort and aid in the emotional healing of those around her. However, caution must be taken as SCP-5757's empathy may also make her emotionally vulnerable and susceptible to manipulation.

Addendum: Testing has shown that SCP-5757's anomalous physical features do not pose any significant threat to containment. However, her empathic abilities are to be closely monitored and studied for future applications in Foundation operations.
