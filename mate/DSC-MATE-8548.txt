SCP-8548, also known as "The Purple-Lipped Doctor," is a human female of unknown age and origin. Her most distinctive feature is her lips, which are a deep shade of purple and appear to be constantly moist. SCP-8548 is a trained medical professional, and her job within the Foundation is to provide medical support and treatment to other SCPs.

SCP-8548's head is adorned with unarranged green hair, making it difficult to determine her hair length or style. On her forehead, she wears a set of goggles that are often pushed up, revealing her purple-tinted eyes. Her ears are decorated with jade earrings, and she always wears a medical mask over her mouth.

The doctor is frequently seen wearing a silver chain around her neck, which is suspected to have significance but remains unexplained. SCP-8548's personality is characterized by her analytical and logical approach to problem-solving. She is often seen engaging in debates and arguments for fun, even about topics that others may find trivial.

While SCP-8548's personality can lead to humorous situations, it also makes her a valuable asset to the Foundation. Her ability to remain detached and objective in high-pressure situations has saved countless lives, and her expertise in medical science makes her an invaluable resource in the field of SCP containment.
