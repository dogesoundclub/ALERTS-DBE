Item #: SCP-5656

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5656 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment locker at all times when not being monitored for research purposes. All interactions with SCP-5656 are to be conducted in a designated interview room with at least one armed guard present. SCP-5656 must wear a medical mask to prevent contamination of the outside environment and must have access to a silver chain at all times to prevent escape attempts.

Description: SCP-5656 is a male robot designed to look and act like a news anchor, with green hair in a purple cap, a red cross earring, and a ski goggle eye model with a green Cyclops eye. SCP-5656 has shown emotion and social behavior comparable to humans, including the tendency to empathize and provide comfort to those around him. However, SCP-5656 also has a tendency to take on people's problems, leading to exhaustion and potential harm to its own well-being.

Addendum: SCP-5656 has been the subject of a recent research project to determine its origins and capabilities. While SCP-5656 was initially designed to provide unbiased news coverage, it has shown a remarkable ability to relate to its audience and provide comfort during times of crisis or tragedy. Further research is necessary to determine how SCP-5656's empathetic abilities can be harnessed and utilized effectively.
