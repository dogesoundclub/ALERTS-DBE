Description: Item 5624 is a tiger hybrid, standing at 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds.

Item 5624's face feature #1 is a frightened mouth, and its eyes are undefined as it wears sunglasses at all times. Its head is covered with a Blue Bandana, and it has a Red Cross Earring on one of its ears. It often wears a Silver Chain around its neck and carries around a Candy Stick as a snack.

Personality: item 5624 is highly organized and likes to plan ahead, but it also has a spontaneous side that can lead to humorous situations. It enjoys surprising its friends with impromptu adventures or planning last-minute parties that often turn out to be a hit. However, despite its outgoing personality, Item 5624 can also be quite anxious and wary of strangers, often coming across as nervous or even paranoid. 

Addendum: Item 5624 was retrieved by the Foundation after numerous reports of a "tiger man" spotted in a major city, causing widespread panic among the public. Item 5624 claims to have been born with its hybrid form and has no knowledge of any genetic experimentation or supernatural influences that may have created it. Further research is required to understand the nature and origins of Item 5624.
