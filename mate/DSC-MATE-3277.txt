SCP-3277, also known as "The Neon Rebel", is a male human possessing unique physical traits that set him apart from the average person. His most notable feature is the striking orange stripes that run down his face, adding a colorful contrast to the rest of his appearance. His eyes are also quite distinctive, as they resemble those of a clown, possessing an almost hypnotic quality with their bright blue color.

Atop his head sits a spike that juts out sharply, almost as if it were a natural extension of his body. The peak spike appears to be composed of a hardened material, almost metallic to the touch, and exudes an aura of aggression and defiance. Additionally, his ears are adorned with green cross earrings, offering yet another unique aspect to his appearance.

What really sets SCP-3277 apart, however, is the LED gas mask that he wears as an accessory. This mask adds an extra layer of complexity to his attire, shrouding his face in a mysterious, almost cybernetic aura. Furthermore, the gas mask flickers and pulses with colorful lights, adding to his already striking appearance.

The Neon Rebel's personality matches his eccentric appearance, possessing a strong sense of independence that often leads to rebellious behavior. He has been known to ditch work early, take days off without permission, and generally resist any authority or rules that he deems unnecessary. Despite this, he possesses a sharp mind and impressive programming skills, making him a valuable asset to any team, provided they can keep him in line.
