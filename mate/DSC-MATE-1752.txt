Item #: SCP-1752

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1752 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. No personnel are to enter SCP-1752's cell without proper approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1752 is to be provided with standard primates' food, suitable toys, and ensembles appropriate for a beautician.

Description: SCP-1752 is a male monkey, of the species Cebus apella, standing at approximately 1.2 meters and weighing 10 kg. SCP-1752's most notable facial feature is a permanent expression of fright, with its blue clown eyes perpetually wide open. SCP-1752 has an unusual accessory on its forehead, a pair of goggles that it tends to wear as a headband.

SCP-1752 is employed as a beautician in Dr. Wondertainment's Fun Factory. It has acquired skills in beautician's crafts, such as hairstyles and makeup, that rival those of professional salons. Additionally, the monkey adorns itself with a gold chain and a whistle around its neck at all times.

SCP-1752 has an erratic and forgetful personality. It frequently gets sidetracked, leading to humorous situations such as forgetting appointments or getting lost. SCP-1752 has been observed consuming beauty products for primates and humans alike, providing remarkable results to both.

Addendum: On 05/08/██, SCP-1752 was found non-responsive in its cell, with a croissant lodged in its throat. SCP-1752 was resuscitated by on-site medical personnel, and all croissants have been removed from the diet of SCP-1752 indefinitely.
