SCP Foundation Description:
Item #: SCP-134
Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-134 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell's walls must be reinforced with steel plating to prevent SCP-134 from escaping. SCP-134 is to be fed twice a day, and is to undergo daily physical and emotional evaluation. 

Description: SCP-134, also known as "Tigerman," is a male tiger who has taken on humanoid characteristics. SCP-134 has human-like eyes with a unique feature - their pupils are jade LED's that resemble the appearance of virtual reality headsets. SCP-134's head is adorned with a blue bandana and a silver chain around their neck. They wear a medical mask over their face, despite being a non-human entity, giving SCP-134 an unnerving appearance. 

SCP-134 exhibits a frightened and nervous demeanor, especially around those who are of a higher rank or authority. However, SCP-134 is known for their creative and imaginative personality, showing an interest in hobbies such as cosplay, poetry, and collecting unique objects. 

SCP-134 was discovered when reports of a "Tigerman" began to circulate throughout the city. Police Officer ████, who is now SCP-134, was found wandering the streets in a state of severe anxiety, displaying their unusual characteristics. It is undetermined why or how SCP-134 became what they are. 

Addendum: SCP-134 has been known to display violent tendencies when under extreme emotional duress. It is requested that any interviews with SCP-134 are conducted with extreme caution, ensuring that the interviewer does not hold a position of authority, and are alone with SCP-134 in the room. Any and all staff interacting with SCP-134 are required to wear earplugs to prevent SCP-134 from using their sonic abilities, as it is unknown whether they are aware of this capability or not.
