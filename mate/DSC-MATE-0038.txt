Item #: 38

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 38, also known as the Theater Manager, is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber is to be equipped with a ventilation system that can accommodate the subject's LED Gas Mask. All interactions with the subject must be carried out with extreme caution due to her playful, yet unpredictable nature.

Description: Subject 38 is a human female with blue clown eyes and a unique fashion sense. The subject is often seen wearing a bucket hat, two-color band across her forehead, and a pair of goggles resting on her forehead. Her jade earrings and LED Gas Mask complete the ensemble, making the subject stand out in any social gathering.

Personality: Subject 38 is a known debater and quick-witted intellect, often engaging in playful arguments with friends and family members for entertainment. The subject's unpredictable nature often leads to humorous interactions that leave those in her company both amused and confused. Her playful nature, however, should not be taken lightly as she has shown a propensity for cunning and resourcefulness when the situation calls for it.

Addendum: Subject 38 was recruited by the Foundation after reports of her unique abilities caught the attention of Foundation operatives. The subject's current role as the Theater Manager allows her to blend in with the general public while maintaining a close eye on any paranormal or anomalous happenings in her local community. Subject 38's talents have been instrumental in the containment of several paranormal entities, and her contributions are much appreciated by the Foundation.
