Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 517 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access is only granted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Subject's medical mask must be worn at all times in order to minimize the transfer of any unknown substances. Extreme caution should be exercised when handling Subject 517 due to potential anomalies presented by their red clown eyes and spots.

Description: 

Subject 517 is a humanoid entity of the female sex, appearing to be of the Homo sapiens species. They stand at an average height of 5'7". Their facial features include a series of spots distributed haphazardly along their cheeks, alongside red clown-like eyes and a red lip. The entity's head is covered with a bucket hat, with a two-color band running across their forehead. One gold earring is present on each of the entity's ears. 

Personality: 

Subject 517 has shown tendencies towards extreme extroversion and sociability, and often attempts to be the center of attention at any given time. Their humorous outbursts and anecdotes can often result in uncontrollable laughter amongst those around them. It is not uncommon for them to engage in behaviors that could be seen as reckless or amoral, showcasing a lack of respect for rules and regulations. 

Addendum: 

Subject 517 was discovered by Foundation agents after reports of their public displays of anomalous behavior began to be made. Subject was then placed under Foundation custody after a thorough examination revealed their abilities to significantly affect those around them. Further tests and investigations are needed to fully understand the extent of Subject 517's anomaly.
