Item #: 1051

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

Subject 1051 is currently employed as a firefighter and is to be allowed to continue their job uninterrupted. The subject is not to be under any circumstances removed from their post or assigned to another location. They are to be monitored at all times, but are allowed to engage in their normal behavior and activities without interference. The subject is willing to cooperate with foundation personnel and may be consulted regarding anomalous fire behavior.

Description:

Subject 1051 is a human female with spots on her face, and typical eyes. She wears normal glasses over her eyes, and a 00s School Girl hairstyle on her head, with green cross earrings on her ears. On her mouth, she wears a medical mask, alongside a gold chain as an accessory. 

Subject 1051 has a thirst for knowledge and spends a significant amount of time reading obscure books and researching various topics, making her a valuable asset to the foundation. She actively collects, documentaries, or other educational materials, and is passionate about sharing that knowledge with others, although she can be selective in terms of what information she shares.

It is unclear how Subject 1051 acquired her knowledge, but given her cooperative nature, it is reasonable to assume that she is not an SCP herself. Nonetheless, the foundation continues to observe and monitor Subject 1051 to ensure that her behavior remains consistent with that of a regular human, in case of any unforeseen anomalous effects.

Addendum:

Note from the Site Director: Itâ€™s reassuring to have Subject 1051 on our side in case of any anomalous fire incidents. Keep up the good work, folks.
