SCP Foundation Containment Report:

Identification Number: SCP-7053

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7053 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber that has been modified to accommodate its feline physiology. It is to be provided with regular meals and exercise, and given access to toys and other items to prevent boredom and aggression. At no point should any unauthorized personnel enter SCP-7053's chamber. In the event of a containment breach, armed security personnel are to be deployed to subdue and re-contain SCP-7053 as soon as possible.

Description: SCP-7053 is a male Bengal Tiger that has been subjected to an unexplained transformation. The creature appears to be fully cognizant and able to communicate in a language similar to that of a typical human, though its vocalizations are heavily accented and gutteral. SCP-7053 possesses a green head that appears to be natural, and a pair of gold earrings embedded in its ears. Additionally, SCP-7053 is often seen wearing a red scarf and carrying a whistle, presumably related to its previous occupation as a security guard.

SCP-7053 is highly intelligent, exhibiting a level of self-awareness and cunning that is far beyond that of an ordinary tiger. Its personality can be described as reliable and organized, preferring to maintain a strict routine and eschewing any form of unexpected change. When confronted with new concepts or ideas that it cannot easily integrate into its worldview, SCP-7053 shows a tendency towards stubbornness, which can lead to humorous or frustrating situations for those attempting to interact with it.

Despite its humanoid qualities, SCP-7053 should not be treated as a domesticated animal or a typical conversation partner. Its transformation has left it in a perpetually agitated state, and it remains a dangerous predator. Personnel should always exercise caution when interacting with SCP-7053, and never underestimate its capabilities.
