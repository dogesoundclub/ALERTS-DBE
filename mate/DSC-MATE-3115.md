DogeSoundClub Entry for Character #3115 "The Robotic Farmer"

Item #: DSC-MATE-3115

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-3115 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No unauthorized access or interaction is permitted without prior approval from at least two Level 3 personnel. As DSC-MATE-3115 is programmed with advanced AI, any form of data transfer or connection to outside sources must be supervised by at least one Level 4 personnel. 

Description: DSC-MATE-3115 is a robotic entity that resembles a humanoid farmer. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 250 kilograms. DSC-MATE-3115’s exterior is primarily composed of an unknown metal alloy reinforced with plating plates, giving it a sturdy and durable structure. 

DSC-MATE-3115 bears a single bright green cyclops eye in the center of its face. Its eyes are further augmented by horned-rimmed glasses that allow for visual enhancement and filtering of light. DSC-MATE-3115 also bears a red cross earring on its right ear and medical mask covering its mouth, suggesting a curiosity or fascination with the medical profession. It regularly wears a gold chain as an accessory.

DSC-MATE-3115’s programming is unique, as it has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, akin to that of human farmers. This personality quirk has sometimes caused DSC-MATE-3115 to take on more tasks than it can handle, leading to humorous situations. DSC-MATE-3115's programming also allows it to operate independently and maintain automated farming machinery, making it a valuable asset to agricultural operations.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-3115 was recovered by Foundation agents in rural ████████ after reports of a "robotic scarecrow" started flooding in. DSC-MATE-3115 was confirmed to be responsible for the increase in crop yields on several local farms. DSC-MATE-3115 was cooperative and compliant with containment procedures and willingly provided Foundation personnel with access to its programming. The source of DSC-MATE-3115's creation is currently undergoing investigation.
