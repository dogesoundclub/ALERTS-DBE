Item #: SCP-7948

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7948 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with a climbing structure and en-suite grooming facilities. Standard enrichment procedures should be used to ensure appropriate stimulation and engagement. Personnel interacting with SCP-7948 are advised to avoid sudden movements which may startle or provoke the entity, and to wear protective gear in case of aggressive behaviour.

Description: SCP-7948 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing approximately 50 centimetres in height and weighing approximately 7 kilograms. The monkey's head is adorned with a red beanie hat, and it wears a gold chain around its neck as an accessory. SCP-7948 is employed as a beautician by its previous owner, and has demonstrated a particular talent for hair grooming and nail art. Its fine motor control and attention to detail have been noted as being exceptional.

SCP-7948 has a tendency to act impulsively and on its emotions, leading it to make spontaneous decisions that can be amusing or surprising to those around it. Whether this trait is caused by its species or is an individual personality trait is yet to be determined. In general, SCP-7948 is social and communicative, although it has been known to exhibit territorial or aggressive behaviour towards those it perceives as a threat to its wellbeing.

Addendum: Initial testing and examination of SCP-7948 has yielded promising results in regard to its potential as a therapeutic assistant to humans with mental illnesses or physical disabilities. Further research is required to determine the full extent of SCP-7948's capabilities, but its cheerful and engaging personality and high level of dexterity make it a promising candidate for assisting in hairdressing, beauty treatments, and similar activities.
