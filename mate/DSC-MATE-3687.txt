Item #: SCP-3687

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3687 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personal items are permitted, but must be searched and cleared by at least two security personnel.

Description: SCP-3687 is a female humanoid of average height and weight, identified as a fast food worker. SCP-3687's face is notable for its prominent red lip and blue clown eyes, and wears a tiara on their head. SCP-3687 also wears a goggle on their forehead, and two accessories consisting of a gold chain and LED gas mask.

SCP-3687 has demonstrated a tendency to be very practical and hands-on, often utilizing unconventional methods to solve problems. Duct tape and paper clips are common tools used by SCP-3687 for making improvised repairs. 

During initial containment, SCP-3687 manifested the ability to repair and operate various electrical devices with great ease, this has been tested and confirmed with light bulbs, batteries, and other basic devices. SCP-3687 was offered a position within the Foundation's engineering team, as the potential risk for displaying their abilities to the public was deemed too high.

SCP-3687 is noted to have a healthy appetite and has on multiple occasions requested and consumed food during scheduled feeding times. Food requests have always been granted upon approval from Site-██ staff. 

Addendum: SCP-3687 has been observed to possess advanced engineering skills and an above-average intelligence not typically associated with the fast-food industry. Testing on SCP-3687's cognitive abilities and IQ are currently pending. 

Further investigations to determine the origins and possible alterations of SCP-3687's abilities are ongoing.
