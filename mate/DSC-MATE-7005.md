Item #: 7005

Object Class: Humanoid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7005 is to be treated as a regular human police officer and should be allowed to continue their duties without interference from any Foundation personnel.

Description: Subject 7005, a male human with orange stripes on his face, possesses unusual cybernetic enhancements in the form of VR Jade LED eyes and a Peak Spike head. Subject 7005 is often seen wearing a gold chain accessory around their neck.

Though possessing a no-nonsense attitude, Subject 7005 has a subtle playfulness often found in those who value tradition. They are adept at telling humorous stories and jokes passed down through their family and community.

Due to the unique combination of physical features and personality traits, Subject 7005 is classified as anomalous. However, their abilities do not pose a threat to civilian safety and are not significant enough to warrant Foundation interference.

Any suggestion of removing Subject 7005 from their duty as a police officer is to be denied. To interfere with their work would only draw attention to their anomalous nature, potentially leading to a containment breach.

Addendum: Subject 7005 has been noted to have a fondness for non-law enforcement sanctioned vigilante justice, but it is believed they are only acting in the interest of justice and in accordance with their personal beliefs. No intervention is deemed necessary at this time.
