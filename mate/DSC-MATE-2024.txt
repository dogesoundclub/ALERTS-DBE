Item #: SCP-2024

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2024 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell with access to basic amenities. All non-essential items and objects must be removed from the cell, as SCP-2024 has exhibited a tendency to form emotional attachments to inanimate objects. The use of the LED gas mask is permitted, but must be removed for regular medical checkups. Any requests made by SCP-2024 should be evaluated by a supervisor before being granted.

Description: SCP-2024 appears to be a human female in her mid-twenties with distinct facial features, including orange stripes on her cheeks, blue clown eyes, and 90s-style brown hair. SCP-2024 has red cross earrings and a silver chain as accessories, but the most notable item is an LED gas mask, which SCP-2024 wears at all times.

SCP-2024 has demonstrated a tendency to form emotional connections with inanimate objects. These attachments can extend to her car, plants, household appliances, and even her containment cell. SCP-2024 is often observed speaking to these objects in a nurturing and caring tone. Caretakers have noted that SCP-2024 has named several of these objects, which she often refers to in the same way one might reference a pet or friend.

SCP-2024 was identified during a low-level security position interview, where the subject displayed an exceptional level of concern for the safety of the building and its occupants. SCP-2024's personality and ability to empathize with objects and individuals alike makes her well-suited for non-invasive SCP duties. However, SCP-2024's anomalous abilities make her a potential security risk if she were to form a connection with an SCP in containment.

Addendum: Dr. ████ has requested that further research be conducted to determine the limits of SCP-2024's abilities to anthropomorphize and care for inanimate objects. Additionally, Dr. ████ recommends that SCP-2024 undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure her emotional state is stable and can handle the stresses of SCP duty.
