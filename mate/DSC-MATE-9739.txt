Item #: SCP-9739

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9739 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-9739 must be conducted through a voice modulator and with the strictest level of caution.

Description: SCP-9739 appears to be a female human of indeterminate age, approximately 5'6" in height, with distinctive orange stripes running across her face. Her eyes are of a peculiar VR Jade LED color, and her otherwise normal appearance is accentuated by a prominent red lip. SCP-9739 displays a noticeable attachment to a gold chain and cigarette.

Despite appearing to be an ordinary human, SCP-9739 demonstrates a remarkable level of affection for both living and non-living things, often attributing human-like characteristics to objects around her. This has been witnessed in various instances including anthropomorphizing household objects such as microwaves, objects from her office, and even plants.

As a politician in the ██████████ region, SCP-9739 has accomplished much during her tenure, noted for her skill at winning a crowd over through her charismatic speeches. Her widespread popularity can be attributed to her innate ability to relate to her audience on a personal level, despite her unusual tendencies.

Addendum: SCP-9739 was discovered during one of her public speeches where she was anomalously able to control the thoughts and emotional states of her listeners, leading to widespread euphoria and amnesia among the audience. The Foundation intervened and brought SCP-9739 into containment to prevent further incidents. While SCP-9739 is not hostile, it is important to remember that her ability to control emotions is still a threat that must be monitored at all times.
