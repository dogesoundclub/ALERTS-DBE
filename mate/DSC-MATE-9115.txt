Description: SCP-9115 is a human woman with a distinctive set of features that make her stand out in any crowd. Her most prominent feature is her purple lipstick, which appears to be a permanent feature of her appearance. She also possesses a pair of VR jade LED eyes that give off a faint glow in the dark. SCP-9115 wears a bucket hat covering her short hair, and a pair of jade earrings adorns her ears.

She is often seen wearing a choker, which appears to be primarily cosmetic in nature. However, it is worth noting that the choker may possess a function that has yet to be identified.

SCP-9115's personality is noteworthy, as her natural talent for leadership often sees her take control of situations regardless of her surroundings. This talent for leadership is evident in her work as a real estate agent, where she commands respect and admiration from her colleagues and clients alike.
