Item #: 2393

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: 2393 is to remain contained within its home base, located within the heart of the city. As the leader of a powerful mafia organization, they must be kept under close watch at all times. Agents are to maintain regular surveillance of 2393's activities and report any suspicious behavior immediately.

Description: 2393 is a male monkey with striking blue clown eyes. Their head is adorned with a blue bandana, and they wear a gold earring in each ear. Two accessories are often seen on their person: a silver chain and a lit cigarette. 2393's physical strength is extraordinary for a creature of its size, which only adds to the inherent danger of their situation.

But it is 2393's personality that makes them the most unique. Far from the cold, calculated demeanor expected of a mafia boss, they instead possess a deep sense of care and nurturing. They are known to anthropomorphize inanimate objects, giving them names and personalities of their own. This behavior has been observed with cars, plants, and even household appliances. 

Despite their criminal activity, 2393 is viewed as something of a protector and champion among their subordinates. They will go to great lengths to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their charge. Even among the most jaded of mafia underlings, they command a certain level of respect and admiration.

It is the juxtaposition of 2393's caring and nurturing tendencies with their dangerous criminal organization that make them such a unique and difficult entity to understand. As such, containment efforts must remain a top priority to ensure the safety of the city's residents.
