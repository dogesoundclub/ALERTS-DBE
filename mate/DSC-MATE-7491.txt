Item #: SCP-7491

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7491 is to be housed in a standard cage equipped with a feeding and watering station in a high-security, isolated area. The cage should be cleaned once per day, and SCP-7491's vitals and health status should be regularly monitored.

SCP-7491's access to the internet or any communication devices must be strictly monitored, and any suspicious or unusual activities should be reported immediately to the site director.

Description: SCP-7491, also known as "Doctor Monkey," is a male monkey of unknown species. It stands approximately 1 meter tall and weighs around 30 kg. SCP-7491 features blue clown eyes, parted pink hair, a jade earring, and wears a red scarf, and an LED gas mask.

SCP-7491 is self-aware and possesses a high level of intelligence, linguistics, and vocational skills. As a trained veterinarian, he is skilled in the diagnoses and treatment of many animal species. However, despite its qualifications, it has displayed a rebellious attitude and has shown resistance to authority and control.

SCP-7491 is inherently independent and displays a lack of trust towards Foundation staff. Its behavior has led to several breaches of containment protocols, including an attempt to escape from the facility. Following this event, it was necessary to enhance security measures to prevent future incidents.

Addendum: Due to SCP-7491's unpredictable and possibly hostile behavior, interactions with it are prohibited without prior approval. SCP-7491 should be considered dangerous, and all personnel should exercise caution when working in the vicinity of the containment area.
