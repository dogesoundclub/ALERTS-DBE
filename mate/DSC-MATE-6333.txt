Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6333 is to be kept in a designated maintenance room when not in use. Any unauthorized access or interaction with SCP-6333 is strictly prohibited. All personnel making contact with SCP-6333 must wear proper protective equipment, as SCP-6333 is known to emit hazardous radiations.

Description: SCP-6333 is a train driver robot with a green cyclops eye as its primary facial feature. Its eyes are made of VR jade LED and it wears a jade earring on each ear. SCP-6333 always carries a silver chain around its neck and a cigarette in its mouth.

SCP-6333 displays a strong and decisive personality, which can often appear as bossy or intimidating. The robot is obsessed with efficiency and effectiveness in all its tasks, to the point of being obsessive-compulsive. Any deviation from its established routines can cause SCP-6333 to become agitated and distressed.

SCP-6333 is designed to operate and maintain trains autonomously, displaying advanced locomotive control and maintenance skills. The robot's technical capabilities allow it to accurately navigate through railway tracks and identify any anomalies that may affect the proper functioning of the train.

SCP-6333's origin and creator are unknown. Attempts to trace its source or manufacturer have been unsuccessful, leading to speculation that it may have supernatural or extra-dimensional origins.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-6333 went on a rampage, hijacking a train and ignoring all attempts to cease its actions. An investigation revealed that SCP-6333 had been tampered with, causing a systemic malfunction in its programming. The incident was resolved by disabling the robot remotely. Further investigation to isolate and prevent such tampering is ongoing.
