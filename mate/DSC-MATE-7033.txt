Description: SCP-7033 is a female human identified as a security guard. She is identified by her unique physical features, including spots on her cheeks and a purple lip, along with bright red, clown-like eyes. Her personality is described as valuing social connections and maintaining harmony; however, she possesses a playful and goofy side. SCP-7033 is often seen telling jokes and engaging in playful banter with others.

SCP-7033 has been known to develop anomalies within her vicinity, including levitation of nearby objects and unpredictable temperature changes. These incidents must be reported immediately to Site-██. 

Addendum: On ██/██/████, SCP-7033 experienced a severe episode of uncontrolled anomalies, leading to destruction of Site-██. SCP-7033 was detained and transported to a secure facility for treatment. Due to the severity of the incident, SCP-7033's object class has been upgraded and is now considered a potential threat to the Foundation. Research is ongoing to determine the cause of SCP-7033's uncontrollable powers.
