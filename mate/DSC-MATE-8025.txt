Item #: 8025

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8025 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-8025 is allowed to work as a train driver under strict observation by Foundation personnel. SCP-8025 is not allowed to interact with civilians without supervision to avoid the spread of anomalous effects.

Description: SCP-8025 is a male rabbit of an unknown subspecies with blue clown eyes. SCP-8025 wears a retro cap with a 2 color band and a jade earring on each ear. Additionally, SCP-8025 wears a gold chain and smokes cigarettes.

SCP-8025 has the anomalous ability to connect with others on a deep level, resulting in individuals sharing personal information and humorous anecdotes. SCP-8025 uses his charisma to create a friendly atmosphere, which can lead to a deeper connection with the interviewee. SCP-8025's abilities persist even outside of the scp foundation, leading to the potential spread of anomalous effects.

SCP-8025 came to the attention of the foundation after reports of passengers leaving the train with a sense of camaraderie and deep connection. SCP-8025 was subsequently captured and contained.

Addendum: Due to SCP-8025's non-violent nature and its beneficial effects on others, the SCP Foundation has approved SCP-8025 for certain humanitarian missions. These missions will be strictly monitored and will only be approved by Level 4 personnel.
