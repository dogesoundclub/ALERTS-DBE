Item Number: SCP-5522

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5522 is to be kept under 24-hour surveillance at all times. All interactions with SCP-5522 are to be logged, and any information gathered must be reported to the designated SCP Foundation officers. In the event of an attempted escape or threat to containment, all personnel are authorized to use lethal force.

Description: SCP-5522 is a human male who currently holds the position of “Mafia Boss”. He is often seen wearing a blue bandana and a gold earring in one ear. SCP-5522 also has noticeable spots on his facial features. It is unknown if these spots are a natural occurrence or the result of physical damage caused by previous altercations.

SCP-5522 has a reputation for being charming and charismatic, often using his charm to manipulate people in his favor. He displays a strong sense of duty and responsibility, ensuring that all members of his organization adhere to strict codes of conduct. Despite his criminal activities, SCP-5522 is known to enjoy having fun, and has been observed partying and dancing with his subordinates.

SCP-5522 is extremely dangerous, and the Foundation has reason to believe that he has connections to other anomalous entities. His ability to manipulate others, coupled with his position of power, make him a significant threat to the Foundation's mission of containment and protection.

Additional Notes: Some Foundation personnel believe that SCP-5522's anomalous abilities may extend beyond his charisma and physical prowess. However, as there is currently no evidence to support this theory, it remains unverified. Further investigation is necessary.
