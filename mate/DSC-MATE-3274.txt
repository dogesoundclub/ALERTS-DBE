SCP Foundation file #3274: The Fast Food Worker

Description: SCP-3274 is a human male, with distinctive spots on his face. His eyes are replaced with VR Jade LED technology, and he is often seen wearing a red beanie and a Jade earring. He is frequently observed holding a cigarette.

Personality: Despite his mundane job as a fast food worker, SCP-3274 displays a quick wit and a dry sense of humor that often catches people off guard. His deadpan delivery of jokes has been noted to be surprisingly funny, and he has a tendency to leave a lasting memorable impression on those who interact with him.

Containment and Interaction Procedures: SCP-3274 is currently contained at Site-██, and is to be allowed access to a designated recreational area under supervision. Interaction with other individuals should be limited to designated testing periods to avoid any potential containment breaches.

Any attempts by SCP-3274 to make physical contact with individuals should be met with caution, as there have been reports of anomalous effects taking place when SCP-3274 touches others. Further research is necessary to determine the exact nature of these anomalies.

SCP-3274 is a prime example of how seemingly ordinary individuals can possess anomalous traits which require careful containment and study. As always, the safety and protection of humanity remains our top priority at the SCP Foundation.
