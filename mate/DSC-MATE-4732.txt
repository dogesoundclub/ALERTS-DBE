SCP-4732, also known as "The Delivery Driver," is a highly advanced robot designed for the sole purpose of delivering packages in the urban areas. Despite its mechanical nature, The Delivery Driver has a surprisingly human-like appearance - sporting a blue bandana around its head and a pair of nerd glasses over its optical sensors.

One of the most intriguing traits of SCP-4732 is its tendency to spend extensive periods lost in thought, often daydreaming or pondering its existence. Although this causes some comical mishaps, such as tripping over objects or walking into walls while deep in thought, it also gives SCP-4732 a curious and contemplative personality.

SCP-4732 can be identified from afar by the dangling cigarette in its metallic grasp, a quirky habit it picked up from the humans it comes across during its deliveries, which The Delivery Driver claims helps to "pass the time" during its long hours of work.

Although SCP-4732 is relatively unassuming and benign, it is still closely monitored by the SCP Foundation to prevent potential security breaches or breaches in the robot's programming. Any attempts at hacking or reprogramming SCP-4732 by unauthorized entities will result in disciplinary action.
