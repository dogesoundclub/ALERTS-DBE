SCP Foundation Classified Document, Item #: 2739

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2739 is to be assigned a designated delivery route in the downtown area to prevent contact with the public, and monitored at all times via GPS tracking. SCP-2739 is capable of self-repair, and any damage or malfunction is to be reported immediately to Site-██ for containment.

Description: SCP-2739 is a male robot of unknown origin, standing at approximately 6 feet tall. SCP-2739's head is a red alarm, with a stainless steel body, and jade earring earpieces. SCP-2739 is often seen holding a cigarette in its metal fingers, although with its lack of lungs, it is unclear what the purpose of the cigarette serves.

SCP-2739 appears to possess a sense of humor and a desire to make others laugh, often emitting jokes and silly impersonations. Agent reports have noted the ability of SCP-2739 to diffuse tense situations with its witty comments and humorous nature, making it a valuable asset in certain containment scenarios.

Although SCP-2739 has not demonstrated any aggressive behavior, due to its unknown origin, full capabilities, and uncontrolled sense of humor, it has been deemed a potential safety hazard and is classified as Euclid.

Addendum: On one occasion, SCP-2739 was observed attempting to conduct a conversation with a nearby pigeon. Whether this indicates a glitch in his programming or a newfound interest in ornithology is unclear at this time. Further study on SCP-2739's peculiar behavior is required.
