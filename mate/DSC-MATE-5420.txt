Item #: SCP-5420

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5420 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to their inclination towards taking risks and trying new things, all requests for exploration or outings must undergo rigorous evaluation and approval by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any unauthorized attempt to escape or engage in dangerous activities must be met with immediate disciplinary actions.

Description: SCP-5420 is a female human with unique facial features. Their lips are a deep shade of purple, and they have blue clown eyes that contrast with their rainbow-colored hairstyle. SCP-5420 wears a green cross earring and a choker as accessories, and is often seen with a cigarette.

Despite their appearance, SCP-5420 is a dangerous villain who enjoys getting into dangerous situations. They have a love for adventure, which often leads to them taking unnecessary risks that put their own safety in jeopardy. SCP-5420's love for danger has led to them surviving near-death experiences, such as bungee jumping mishaps or getting lost in the wilderness.

It is speculated that SCP-5420's disregard for their own safety may stem from a desire to experience something beyond their mundane existence. As a result, they have become a significant threat to the safety of others and must be contained at all times.

Addendum: Due to SCP-5420's love for adventure, containment personnel are prohibited from sharing details of any interesting or exciting events with them, as this may trigger a desire to engage in similar activities. All reports and updates must remain strictly professional and devoid of any emotional enticement.
