Item #: SCP-856

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-856 is to be kept in a standard human containment chamber, equipped with a high-tech electrical wiring system. The chamber must be fitted with an emergency shut-off system that can be activated remotely in case of a power surge or malfunction. SCP-856 is allowed to work as an electrician under close supervision of the Foundation, and must be monitored at all times using GPS tracking technology.

Description: SCP-856 is a female human with unusual physical features. The subject has orange stripes on her face, a tiara on her head, and red cross earrings. SCP-856's eyes are replaced with virtual reality jade LED, and she frequently wears a medical mask over her mouth. She also wears a silver chain around her neck.

SCP-856 is a highly empathetic individual who has the ability to sense and interpret the emotions of others. She often uses this skill to help people in difficult situations, providing comfort and support where needed. SCP-856 has shown no malicious intent, and seems to genuinely want to help those around her.

However, SCP-856's abilities are closely linked to her electrical wiring. When SCP-856 experiences strong emotions, it can cause a surge of electricity that can be dangerous to those nearby. In extreme cases, her emotional state can cause a full-scale power outage or electrical overload. It is for this reason that she is kept under close supervision by the Foundation.

SCP-856 has proven to be a valuable asset to the Foundation, using her electrical skills to assist with containment procedures and other tasks. However, her abilities must be monitored closely to ensure the safety of all involved. The Foundation is committed to keeping SCP-856 under control and using her powers for the greater good.
