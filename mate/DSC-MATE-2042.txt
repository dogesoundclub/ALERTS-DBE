Item #: 2042

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2042 is currently employed as a police officer and is to be allowed to continue in his occupation. SCP-2042's work environment is to be monitored for any anomalous activity or instances of SCP-2042 becoming emotionally compromised.

SCP-2042 is to be restricted from access to any anomalous objects or entities, except under controlled testing.

Description: SCP-2042 is a male human with normal blonde hair and red clown eyes. SCP-2042 has a distinct mouth spot and a two-color band on his forehead. SCP-2042 is often seen wearing a red scarf and a green cross earring. SCP-2042 is also a smoker and can often be seen with a cigarette.

SCP-2042's personality is characterized by their empathetic and compassionate nature. SCP-2042 has a tendency to take on other people's problems as their own, often feeling responsible for fixing everything and everyone around them. This personality characteristic can be both admirable and exhausting.

SCP-2042's anomalous properties have not been fully studied. It is unknown if SCP-2042's red clown eyes have any effect on individuals or if they are purely cosmetic.

Addendum: Dr. ██████ has suggested conducting further testing on SCP-2042 to determine if their empathetic and compassionate nature is a result of anomalous properties or if it is simply a personality characteristic. Further testing on this matter has been approved by O5-██.
