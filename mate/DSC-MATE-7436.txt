Item #: SCP-7436

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7436 is to be contained within a sound-proof cell at Site-███. Due to SCP-7436's occupation as a news anchor, it is imperative that all broadcasts featuring SCP-7436 be monitored and censored in the event that any anomalous behavior is exhibited on-air.

Description: SCP-7436 is a human female with the ability to manipulate visual stimuli to project a rainbow-like LED display in place of eyes. These "VR Rainbow LED" eyes are reported to be particularly disturbing to those who make eye contact, causing intense and often debilitating hallucinations. SCP-7436's head is metal blue and their ears are adorned with a red cross earring.

SCP-7436 exhibits a strong sense of duty and responsibility in their work as a news anchor, but has also been observed to engage in playful and humorous behavior at social events. This dualistic behavior has been the cause of many unexpected and often embarrassing situations.

SCP-7436's red lip feature has been noted as particularly captivating to those who come into contact with it, causing a heightened sense of fascination and attraction. SCP-7436 is advised to conceal this feature during all interactions with Foundation personnel.

Addendum: Incident Report 7436-01

On ██/██/████, SCP-7436 was involved in an on-air incident during a live broadcast. During a particularly heated political debate, SCP-7436's LED eyes began to display erratic patterns, causing those who viewed the broadcast to experience seizures and hallucinations. SCP-7436 was ushered off the set and containment procedures were immediately increased. Investigation into the cause of the anomaly is ongoing.
