Description: Subject 5877 is a female human, identified as the manager of a local theater. They possess striking physical features, including orange stripes on their face and purple lips. Their clown-like appearance is completed by red eyes and a pink rabbit head.

Subject 5877 also sports two-color bands on their forehead and red cross earrings, adding to their unique and bizarre appearance.

While they display a strong sense of duty in their role as a theater manager, Subject 5877 is known to have a penchant for fun and can often be found dancing and performing silly antics at social events.

Subject 5877's behavior is not indicative of any known mental illness, leading researchers to believe their quirky demeanor is a result of their unorthodox appearance.
