SCP-7042: The Autonomous Programmer-Rabbit

Classification: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7042 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, modified with additional space to accommodate for its large ears and tail. SCP-7042 is to be provided with a computer and programming software to keep it engaged and cooperative. The gas mask is to be removed for feeding and social interaction only. Any attempts by SCP-7042 to access the Foundation's computer systems are to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7042 is a male rabbit with red fur and sharp features. Its most distinctive feature is its jade earring, which it is highly protective of. The rabbit wears a normal gas mask at all times, despite not requiring it to survive. The mask has been observed to have a calming effect on SCP-7042's behavior.

SCP-7042 is highly intelligent and skilled in programming languages. Its independent personality has often come into conflict with Foundation personnel, as it is resistant to being told what to do. SCP-7042 prefers to work alone and avoid social interaction, often retreating into its programming projects for long periods of time.

However, SCP-7042's stubbornness and reluctance to ask for help has led to humorous situations. On several occasions, it has been observed attempting to move heavy objects on its own, resulting in comical outcomes. SCP-7042 also has a habit of refusing to use maps or directions when lost, preferring to rely on its own instincts.

Due to SCP-7042's abilities and independent nature, it has been designated as a Euclid-class anomaly. Efforts to recruit the rabbit as a covert programming asset are ongoing.
