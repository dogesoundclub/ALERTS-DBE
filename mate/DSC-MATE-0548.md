Item #: 548

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 

Subject 548 is to be contained in a standard secure humanoid chamber at Site-██ at all times when not on assignment. Standard monitoring and observation protocols are to be followed at all times due to the nature of the subject.

Under no circumstances is anyone authorized to remove the LED gas mask from subject 548's possession, except under authorized testing or emergency situations. The gas mask appears to have anomalous properties and removal could result in unintended consequences.

Description: 

Subject 548 is a female human news anchor with orange stripes dispersed throughout her face, resembling that of a witch's familiar. Her head of hair is short, accentuating her Red Cross Earring that adorns her left ear. Normal glasses with a subtle tint cover her eyes, which seem to emit a glow when subject 548 experiences extreme emotions.

Despite subject 548's unmoving features and stoic expression, the person behind the visage has a surprisingly dry sense of humor that often catches unsuspecting people off guard. Her deadpan jokes tend to be pithy, biting, and sharp, keeping those around her on edge.

It has been observed that subject 548 possesses a gold chain, although its purpose and role in her life remain unclear. It has been hypothesized that the chain somehow interacts with the gas mask, amplifying the mask's potential effects.

Addendum 1: 

In recent weeks, subject 548 has displayed behavior that suggests a budding interest in paranormal research. (See attached document 548-A for more details). The necessity of this research to securely contain and research anomalous objects within our facilities is clear, and due to the subject's talents and knowledge in news reporting, she may be a valuable asset to the organization's efforts.

Unfortunately, the gas mask that 548 clings to is causing some concern among researchers at Site-██, who are exhibiting similar traits to the paranormal phenomena researched. Research into the mask and its effects is ongoing; caution and isolation from certain members of staff and D-class personnel may be necessary until further notice.
