Item #: SCP-5190

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5190 is to be kept in standard humanoid containment at Site-███. Due to its nature as a real estate agent, SCP-5190 is permitted to have limited communication with individuals outside of Foundation personnel under the guise of conducting business. However, any information gathered during these interactions must be reported immediately to senior staff.

Description: SCP-5190 is a male human with distinct physical features. Notably, SCP-5190 possesses a peak spike hairstyle and wears gold earrings. It has been observed that SCP-5190 often carries a candy stick as a means of calming and distracting itself.

SCP-5190's primary anomalous ability lies in its natural charm and charisma. Its infectious smile, coupled with its ability to entertain and engage others, earns it the nickname "The Life of the Party." However, it has also been noted that SCP-5190 struggles with maintaining focus and can easily be distracted by its desire to entertain.

SCP-5190's profession as a real estate agent works in its favor, often allowing it to gain the trust and favor of potential clients. This has led to instances of SCP-5190 utilizing its charm to gain access to information or properties of interest to Foundation operations.

Despite its friendly demeanor, SCP-5190 displays a cautious and reserved personality when in the presence of Foundation personnel. It has been noted to be cooperative with containment efforts, but maintains a subtle distance from those around it.

Addendum: Following an incident in which SCP-5190 attempted to utilize its charm to gain forbidden access to Site-███, all interactions with non-Foundation individuals have been restricted to ensure the continued containment of SCP-5190. Any instances of SCP-5190 displaying behavior uncharacteristic of its natural charm should be reported to senior staff immediately.
