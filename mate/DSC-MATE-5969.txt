Item #: 5969

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 5969 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-19. Access to his chamber requires Level 2 clearance, and all interaction with him is to be conducted in a controlled environment. 5969 is allowed access to a personal computer with internet access, as it serves as a valuable means of keeping his mind occupied.

Description: 5969, a Caucasian male with blonde hair and green cross earring, appears to be in his early thirties, and stands at 5'10". His most notable feature is his continually frightened-looking mouth, which he maintains irrespective of his emotional state. The reason for this trait is unclear, and it has remained unchanged since his admission to the Foundation. 

5969 identifies as a human of the male gender and often spends free time tending to small mechanical projects in his cell. He claims to have been a mechanic before being forcibly recruited by persons unknown, he offers little information beyond that. 5969's analytical and logical tendencies make him highly skilled with mechanics that are out of the ordinary, from anomalous engines to anomalous dynamic systems.

Despite his highly analytical mind, 5969 is known for his love of argumentation, especially when it comes to trivial topics. He frequently engages in debates with D-Class personnel, staff, and even visiting Researchers, prompting many humorous situations. Despite this trait, 5969 is known for being helpful, honest, and passionate in his work.

So far, there have been no recorded incidents of hostility, and his temperament is stable, cautious, and somewhat anxious. However, it is essential to note that his abilities may lend themselves to potential breaches if he were to malfunction or be tampered with. Therefore, Site Security has closed off the mechanical workshop from his cell.

Addendum - Interview 5969-1: In a recent interview, 5969 admitted that he knows more about "anomalous systems than most people, and that small a spark can make a tremendous impact on things beyond what is known." He was referring to his design of machines that use three or more anomalous engines, which he claims have "force or power me that I can't limit or predict entirely." 5969 has stated that he prefers working with anomalous engines over any other type, saying they challenge his mind and mental capabilities.

In conclusion, 5969 is a capable mechanic with a love of argumentation and an interest in anomalous systems. His analytical, mechanical expertise could be beneficial to the Foundation, and while there are risks involved in working with him, his usefulness outweighs them.
