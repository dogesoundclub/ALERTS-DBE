Description: Subject 2304, codename "The Lawyer", is a male human with distinctive orange stripes on his face. His head is encased in multiple layers of green material, and he wears nerd glasses over his eyes. A jade earring adorns one of his ears, while a medical mask conceals his mouth. A gold chain is also consistently worn around his neck.

Personality-wise, The Lawyer is known to be nurturing and caring. He often takes on the role of a caregiver, imbuing him with a paternalistic nature. Despite this, he occasionally becomes overbearing and is prone to taking care of those around him as if they are his own children. His behavior can merit chuckles and lighthearted jests.

Subjects that display a similar appearance to The Lawyer have yet to be observed, leading experts to ponder if his orange stripes and green layers are a result of a unique mutation or experimental procedure. The Lawyer's profession appears to have no connection to his anomalous attributes. At this time, no adverse effects have been reported when dealing with The Lawyer outside of his overprotectiveness.

Due to the limited information regarding the nature of The Lawyer's unique features, he has been classified as Safe. His accommodations require no special precautions, and interaction with him requires no special protocols. Though, it's highly recommended to assure him that you can take care of yourself when around him.
