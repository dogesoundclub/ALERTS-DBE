Item #: 2318

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their nature as a sapient rabbit, Subject 2318 has been granted a comfortable living space within Site-███. The subject is permitted to engage in programming activities on workstations provided within their containment chamber. Any attempt by the subject to leave Site-███ must be thoroughly assessed before being granted.

Description: Subject 2318 appears as a brown rabbit with normal glasses and a hoodie with a 2 Colo Band on its forehead. It also wears a silver chain and carries a candy stick as an accessory. Its rebellious nature has been observed to show itself in their resistance towards authority and unnecessary rules. 

Personality: Subject 2318 has a strong sense of independence and refuses to bow down to anyone who poses unnecessary authority over them. This behavior has been noted by the Foundation staff as mildly anomalous considering the subject's species, and researchers continue to investigate.

Addendum: Interview Log 2318-1

Interviewer: Dr. [REDACTED]

Subject 2318: [Shuffles in their seat, chewing absentmindedly on the candy stick in their possession]

Dr. [REDACTED]: Subject 2318, do you understand why you are here?

Subject 2318: [Stops chewing] I'm here because I'm a rabbit who apparently can program like a human. [Smirks]

Dr. [REDACTED]: Quite. But our concern isn't your programming abilities. We are curious about your rebellious behavior towards authority.

Subject 2318: [Rolls their eyes] I just don't believe in following rules for the sake of them. If I see an unnecessary rule or something that doesn't sit right with me, I'll push back against it.

Dr. [REDACTED]: And why is that?

Subject 2318: [Pauses chewing] I guess I'm just not willing to let someone else tell me how to live my life. It's my life, my rules.

Dr. [REDACTED]: I see. And how do you feel about being contained here, in this facility?

Subject 2318: [Sighs] Not great, obviously. But I knew the risks when I decided to show off my skills. You guys are just doing your job, I suppose.

Dr. [REDACTED]: I see. Thank you for your time, Subject 2318.

[End Log]

Note: Further investigation into Subject 2318's history and motivations for their rebellious nature are ongoing.
