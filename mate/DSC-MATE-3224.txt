SCP-3224, also referred to as "The Politician," is a male Monkey with an incredibly unique appearance. Sported with horn-rimmed glasses over his wide, bright colored eyes and a red beanie on his head. He dons a shiny, gold earring on one ear, which only serves to enhance his peculiar appearance even further. However, the most striking accessory he wears is a standard, normal gas mask that he refuses to remove even in the company of others.

Despite his zany appearance, SCP-3224 is incredibly charming and is known to be a skilled politician. He excels at charming his way out of sticky situations and can often sway others to his way of thinking. Being a supreme extrovert, SCP-3224 loves being at the center of attention in any social gathering. He's not afraid to crack a joke or tell a clumsy story, and he has a knack for making others laugh even at the darkest of moments.

SCP-3224's amusing manner and charming personality have made him a beloved figure amongst many. However, one should not underestimate his intellect, as he is known to be a formidable opponent if crossed. He is highly strategic and can be manipulative if the situation calls for it. Given his unique ability to blend in with high-class society, it is no wonder SCP-3224's political career has been such a successful one. However, his anomalous gas mask and its powers have yet to be fully understood, and further investigation is highly recommended.
