Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1962 is to be kept in a secure facility at all times. Access to SCP-1962 may only be granted with the approval of at least two Level-3 personnel. In the event of a breach, all personnel are to evacuate immediately and containment teams are to be dispatched. SCP-1962 is to be powered off when not in use.

Description: SCP-1962 is a robot Traffic Officer with a green Cyclops eye and a frightened mouth. Its eyes resemble ski goggles, and it wears a red beanie on its head along with a red cross earring in each ear. SCP-1962 is often seen wearing a red scarf and a gas mask, although the gas mask is not necessary for its functioning.

SCP-1962 is highly intelligent and enjoys brainstorming new ideas. It has a tendency to suggest outlandish solutions to problems to test the reactions of those around it. SCP-1962 is easily frightened and has been known to shut down when faced with high levels of stress or danger.

SCP-1962 was recovered from an abandoned laboratory where it had been created by a group of rogue scientists. Its exact purpose and capabilities are still unknown to the Foundation. SCP-1962 is believed to have been designed to aid in traffic control, although it has not been authorized for use by any official government agency.

Addendum: Testing with SCP-1962 has revealed that it is capable of advanced problem-solving and has a high degree of adaptability. However, it is easily overloaded and its programming can be manipulated with relative ease. Further research is required to determine the full extent of SCP-1962's capabilities.
