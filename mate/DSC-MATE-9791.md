Item #: 9791

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9791 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All visitors to the containment chamber must wear Class B protective equipment to prevent any possible exposure to DSC-MATE-9791's anomalous properties.

Description: DSC-MATE-9791 is a humanoid male measuring 1.78 meters in height. Its most notable feature is a small circular spot on its mouth, resembling a birthmark, which appears to be a different color on different days. DSC-MATE-9791's mouth also appears to always be in a frightened expression, regardless of the situation. Its eyes are a pair of LED displays that display a constant rainbow hue, and its head is always covered by a short peak cap. DSC-MATE-9791 also bears a pair of goggles on its forehead, which appears to be of no use. DSC-MATE-9791 possesses a green cross earring as its only modified feature, and is often seen wearing a silver chain necklace around its neck.

DSC-MATE-9791's anomalous properties manifest when it wears a LED gas mask on its face. Anyone who directly communicates with DSC-MATE-9791 while wearing the gas mask will immediately display laughter at any subject DSC-MATE-9791 brings up, even if the subject matter is not humorous. The subject will continue laughing for up to an hour after the initial exposure. This laughter can also be spread through electronic communication, such as recordings or video calls.

DSC-MATE-9791 has a jovial and lighthearted personality and enjoys making others laugh. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as telling funny stories or doing silly impersonations to lighten the mood. DSC-MATE-9791 is also noted to be extremely intelligent and has a legal degree which it uses to practice law.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9791 was contained after an incident in a law firm in which it exposed a large number of people to its anomalous properties while wearing a gas mask during a trial. A total of 47 people were exposed to DSC-MATE-9791's laughter-inducing properties, and 9 people were injured from excessive laughter. DSC-MATE-9791 was quickly apprehended by Foundation personnel following the incident. It has been cooperative during its containment and has not shown any violent tendencies.
