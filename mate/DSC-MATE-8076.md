Item#: 8076

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the unpredictable nature of the individual designated as 8076, containment procedures must be in place at all times. Subject 8076 must be monitored constantly and kept under surveillance to ensure their unpredictable temperament is contained within the confines of their work as a Lawyer. Any deviation from this procedure may result in the subjectâ€™s inclination towards chaos, disorder and entropy to be unleashed.

Description: 

Designation 8076 is an adult, female human employed as a Lawyer. The subject has a very high-energy personality and is often enthusiastic about everything around her. She wears her Jade earrings, normal glasses, Medical Mask, and a unique colored band on her forehead, which signifies her love for flashy accessories. Designation 8076 is never seen without her Gold Chain wrapped around her neck.

Though the subject has not shown any evidence of being abnormal, caution must be used when interacting with her. Designation 8076 has a unique ability to excite and manipulate those around her into matches of chaotic laughter or rage. Hence, it is highly advised only to approach her when in a subdued state, as excessive excitement around the subject may cause temporary mental instability and even schizophrenia.

Addendum: 

Designation 8076 has recently appeared to be sociopathic and has gained an interest in causing chaos and disorder on a grand scale. The incident with package 6A has raised concerns about her obsession with the occult and supernatural. It is immensely encouraged to closely observe the designated 8076; any sign of abnormal behavior should be immediately reported to the Foundation.
