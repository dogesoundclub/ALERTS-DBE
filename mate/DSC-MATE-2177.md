Addendum: Incident Report 2177-01

On ██/██/████, DSC-MATE-2177 was delivering a package to Site-██ when it encountered a Level 3 containment breach involving several aggressive DSCs. Instead of following standard safety procedures, DSC-MATE-2177 suggested utilizing the contents of the package to subdue the creatures.

While initially hesitant to such an unconventional idea, Foundation personnel ultimately decided to follow DSC-MATE-2177's lead, and the plan successfully neutralized the rogue DSCs. As a result of this incident, DSC-MATE-2177's brainstorming abilities have been classified as potentially useful, and further testing is pending.
