DogeSoundClub Containment Report: 7915

Containment Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7915 is to be contained within a reinforced steel cage with a thick layer of reinforced glass for observation purposes. High-intensity halogen lamps are to be used in the containment cell to create a daylight-like environment. The cell must also be supplied with a live goat every week as a food source. The delivery driver is to be sedated during transportation to prevent injuries to both himself and the staff.

Description: DSC-MATE-7915 is a male tiger standing approximately 7ft tall, with distinctive red clown eyes that glow in the dark. It sports a jade earring on the left ear and an industrial goggle on his forehead. Its mouth is always hidden behind a medical mask. DSC-MATE-7915 is capable of human speech and seems to have an affinity for comedy. They frequently tell jokes and engage in humorous antics to amuse themselves and their audience.

DSC-MATE-7915 was initially discovered in the wild by local farmers in Southeast Asia, where it had been preying on livestock. However, DogeSoundClub agents intervened and managed to capture it. DSC-MATE-7915 was then transported to Site-██ for study.

Personality: DSC-MATE-7915 exhibits a jovial personality and enjoys being the center of attention. Their sense of humor is sometimes considered inappropriate or even unprofessional. However, it is well-received at social gatherings and sometimes makes the DSC seem much more approachable. They are quick-witted and find humor in most aspects of their captivity. The DSC seems to enjoy the human interaction but can become aggressive when attempting to leave the containment site or when they feel someone is testing their control.

DSC-MATE-7915's humor sometimes takes on a darker edge, as evidenced by the delivery driver's fear when in close proximity to the DSC. The fear and subsequent detailing of DSC-MATE-7915's behavior makes such situations humorous, albeit disturbing. Despite being scary, DSC-MATE-7915 has a high level of intelligence but has mostly refused to cooperate with staff, preferring to make various jokes that can disrupt work processes.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-7915's sedation has been increased to prevent any mishap while transporting it to its containment cell. Updates to the containment procedures may be considered in the future.
