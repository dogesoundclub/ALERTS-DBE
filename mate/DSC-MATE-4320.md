Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-4320 must be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Their presence in public areas must be restricted, and they are not allowed to interact with non-Foundation personnel without prior approval from at least two Level 4 personnel. DSC-MATE-4320 must not be exposed to bright lights or sudden loud noises, as this may result in a state of panic or distress.

Description: DSC-MATE-4320 is a male rabbit of average size, standing at approximately 1.1 meters and weighing 5 kilograms. They possess blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth, which gives them a perpetual expression of fear. DSC-MATE-4320 wears a blue bandana, a red scarf around their neck, and an LED gas mask over their face, which is always lit up with colorful patterns. Despite the use of a gas mask, DSC-MATE-4320 is capable of speech and has excellent communication skills.

DSC-MATE-4320 has a natural charm and charisma that is highly contagious, which can make them the center of attention in social situations. They have a talent for telling jokes and entertaining others, often performing silly dances or stunts to make others laugh. They are known for their sense of humor and lightheartedness, despite their constant display of fear.

DSC-MATE-4320 is employed as a banker and has shown proficiency in financial management and accounting. However, due to their anomalous nature, DSC-MATE-4320's duties at the bank are restricted, and they are not allowed to handle large sums of money unsupervised.

DSC-MATE-4320 has shown no sign of aggression, and their primary emotion is fear. Despite their friendly demeanor, DSC-MATE-4320 is unable to handle stressful or challenging situations, which can result in panic attacks or emotional breakdowns.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-4320 was acquired by the Foundation after reports of a "weird-looking rabbit in a gas mask" started to surface in several social media feeds. After establishing contact with DSC-MATE-4320, a containment plan was devised, and DSC-MATE-4320 was brought into custody. Their origins and the reason for their anomalous abilities are currently unknown and under investigation.
