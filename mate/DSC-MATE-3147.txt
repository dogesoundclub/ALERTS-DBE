Description: SCP-3147 is a human male with anomalous physical traits. SCP-3147 possesses green layers protruding from its head in a manner similar to hair. Additionally, SCP-3147 has a mouth spot and a permanent smile. A gold earring is present on each ear and a gold chain is typically worn around SCP-3147's neck.

SCP-3147 is a lawyer by profession and is known for its emotional sensitivity. SCP-3147 is easily moved to tears by sentimental moments in movies or TV shows and often expresses a fondness for music or art that evokes strong feelings in others.

Despite these emotional tendencies, SCP-3147 maintains a highly professional demeanor when interacting with others, especially in a legal context. SCP-3147 is highly skilled in the field of law, making it an asset to the Foundation's legal team.

Addendum: Due to SCP-3147's particular brand of anomaly, caution must be exercised when exposing the subject to any media or art that may trigger an emotional reaction. SCP-3147's containment chamber should be equipped with a soundproofing system to prevent emotional outbursts from disturbing nearby personnel.
