Item #: SCP-8320

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8320 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a writing desk, a chair, and a bed. The chamber must be made soundproof and free from any distractions. It is necessary to provide SCP-8320 with ample resources to nourish their mind and keep them mentally stable.

Any interaction with SCP-8320 should be carried out by personnel with Level 3 clearance or above. Under no circumstances should SCP-8320 be exposed to any form of audio-visual media or external stimuli.

Description: SCP-8320 is a human female with orange stripes on her face, giving her a tiger-like appearance. Her head is tilted to one side in a constant position, and she wears a red cross earring attached to her left ear. SCP-8320 often wears a choker around her neck, and an LED gas mask that illuminates a ghostly blue light, making her recognizable from a distance.

SCP-8320 displays introverted behavior and spends most of her time lost in thought. This is most likely due to her unusual physiology that has granted her superior cognitive abilities. She tends to be absent-minded and can accidentally injure herself or others if left unattended. SCP-8320 possesses a charming smile that can be enigmatic and seductive, often luring potential victims into her trap.

SCP-8320 displays a range of abilities that are still under research. Her strength, endurance, and agility are greater than those of an average human being. SCP-8320 is also capable of maneuvering through complex environments with remarkable precision, often traversing paths that appear as though they are not meant for humans.

SCP-8320 displays a cautious nature and will not initiate any form of communication. She prefers to stay away from the public eye and will attack anyone who approaches her, demonstrating her villainous intent.

Addendum: SCP-8320 has not demonstrated any animosity towards other SCP entities thus far. Further study is ongoing to understand SCP-8320's motives and goals.
