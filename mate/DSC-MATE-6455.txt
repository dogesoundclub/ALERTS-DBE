Item #: 6455

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6455 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Access to SCP-6455 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-6455 is a male monkey with shade glasses, a police cap, and a red scarf. SCP-6455's notable feature is the jade earring it wears on its left ear. SCP-6455 identifies itself as a news anchor and has a strong sense of independence. It is capable of sophisticated language use and has demonstrated an extensive knowledge of current events.

SCP-6455 has a stubborn streak and will sometimes refuse to accept assistance, despite overwhelming evidence that it is needed. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as SCP-6455 trying to move heavy objects by itself or insisting it does not need a map when lost. SCP-6455 appears to be unaware of its own limitations and is prone to overestimating its abilities.

SCP-6455 was first discovered after an incident in which it hijacked a live news broadcast to deliver a fake news story. Mobile Task Force Lambda-4 was deployed to locate SCP-6455 and take it into Foundation custody. During the operation, SCP-6455 displayed a remarkable ability to evade capture, leading to the conclusion that it is highly intelligent and resourceful.

Addendum: Due to complaints from SCP-6455 regarding its confinement, it has been provided with a small television set that shows live news broadcasts. SCP-6455 appears to be content with this arrangement and has demonstrated improved cooperation with Foundation personnel. Monitoring of SCP-6455's behavior is ongoing.
