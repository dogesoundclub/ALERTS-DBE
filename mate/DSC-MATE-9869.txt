Item #: SCP-9869

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9869 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. No special accommodations are necessary, aside from standard amenities, and SCP-9869 should be allowed access to recreational materials within reason. All communications with SCP-9869 are to be conducted through a secure video feed, as physical contact is not necessary nor permitted.

Description: SCP-9869 is a human male, standing approximately 180 cm tall and weighing approximately 75 kilograms. SCP-9869 presents with numerous unique physical features, including orange stripes on his face, green hair in a purple cap, and a red victory band on his forehead. Additionally, SCP-9869 wears nerdy glasses over his eyes and a jade earring on his left earlobe. SCP-9869 is often seen wearing a silver chain and smoking a cigarette.

SCP-9869 works as a theater manager and has a natural charm and charisma that can make them the life of the party. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as telling jokes or doing silly dances to make others laugh. While SCP-9869 is capable of communicating with humans, it is unknown if they are capable of interdimensional communication.

The source of SCP-9869's anomalous properties is unknown. SCP-9869 is capable of generating a memetic field that causes those in their presence to feel a sense of euphoria and happiness. This effect persists even remotely through video feeds, and it is unclear if SCP-9869 is intentionally generating this effect or if it is a result of their personality.

Addendum: SCP-9869 has been approved for monthly psychological evaluations to monitor their mental state while in Foundation custody. Results have shown that SCP-9869 is relatively stable and presents no threat to Foundation personnel. Continued monitoring is recommended.
