Containment Procedures:
Subject 1279, also known as "Politimonek" is to be contained in a reinforced cage made of non-bendable steel with a 5-inch titanium-alloy layer. Due to its strong independent nature, the subject must be kept under intense surveillance, and guards must be stationed at all times to prevent any attempted breakouts.

Description:
Subject 1279 resembles a typical monkey, except for his nerdy glasses, bucket hat, and jade earring. He is often seen wearing a silver chain, which he fiercely guards against any attempt to strip him of it. Though seemingly harmless, the subject's behavior is to be taken seriously as he has exhibited cognitive abilities similar to that of a human.

Personality:
Subject 1279 displays a strong sense of independence which may hinder his cooperation with others. He can be stubborn, even in situations that require assistance, often leading to comical situations. Despite this, the subject is an intelligent political advocate and has shown a high degree of rhetoric during debates and speeches.

In conclusion, while containing Subject 1279 may seem unnecessary, it is imperative that we do not underestimate the capabilities of this politician monkey. His willingness to go against the norm and push through challenges, even when faced with issues beyond his grasp, is what makes him a unique and valuable asset, albeit one that needs continued control and monitoring.
