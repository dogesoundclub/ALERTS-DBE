Item #: 5596

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5596 is to be contained in a standard biocontainment cell at all times. The cell should be fitted with a reinforced titanium cage to prevent escape attempts. Access to the cell is restricted to Level 4 personnel with prior approval from at least two Level 5 personnel. 

Description: 5596 is an anomalous entity resembling a Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). The entity is outfitted with a bucket hat and a pair of rainbow-colored LED eyes, giving it an eerie and unsettling appearance. It is also frequently spotted wearing a gold chain and a normal gas mask for unknown reasons. 

The entity displays a frightened mouth, which adds to its overall mystique. 5596 is not known to speak, but it communicates by making a series of snarls, growls, and occasional roars. The entity has demonstrated incredible strength and reflexes, making it a formidable opponent in a physical altercation.

It is important to note that 5596 has an empathetic and compassionate personality type. Despite its capacity for violence, it seems to care deeply about others and often takes on their problems as if they were its own. This behavior can sometimes result in the entity overexerting itself, leading to exhaustion or potential harm.

Addendum: 5596 has been identified as a "villain," a term used to describe entities that consistently display aggressive and antisocial behaviors. However, it is unclear what motivates 5596 to act in this manner. Research into the entity's origins and abilities is ongoing.
