Item #: 6218

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6218 is to be monitored regularly by Foundation personnel to ensure that it does not exhibit any abnormal supernatural abilities. Subject's residency and employment at the animal hospital must be maintained to prevent attention to the anomalous activity. Any activities deemed as hazardous to non-anomalous humans are to be reported to Supervisor immediately.

Description: Subject 6218 is a human male, approximately 36 years old. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs 175 lb. Subject 6218 works as a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals such as sphynx cats and reptiles. However, it is not just subject's profession that attracts attention from the Foundation.

Subject 6218 has spots on their face, which are not the result of any known medical condition. Its eyes are visible only behind nerd glasses, which effectively hides any potential supernatural abilities upon sight. It sports green hair which is always covered with a noticeable purple cap, an odd choice of accessory.

Subject 6218's forehead has a pair of goggles on it, even though its job does not require any protective gear as such. Its notable accessories include a silver chain around its neck and a cigarette that it can often be seen smoking.

Personality-wise, subject 6218 is quite eccentric, known for having a wacky and humorous personality which often results in funny situations. It has a tenacious sense of duty and responsibility towards its patients, to an unorthodox degree where it oftentimes goes above and beyond for them.

However, one must not underestimate subject 6218's ability to wind down and enjoy life outside work. Its dance moves and silly antics have been the talk of many social events, ensuring that it is loved by its friends and acquaintances.

Addendum: Due to the circumstances surrounding its unique appearance and personality, subject 6218 has permission to deviate from standard protocol. Its continued monitoring will still happen, but with a less astringent approach due to its cooperative behavior.
