Description: Subject 5028 is a male individual of human species displaying spot-like patches on his complexion. The subject also exhibits a constant expression of timidness and a frightened mouth. His eyes appear to be a VR Jade LED display, protruding from his cranial cavity. The subject always wears a retro cap and goggles resting on his forehead, along with a golden earring. The most distinguishing feature is the LED gas mask he wears as an accessory that hides his nose and mouth.

Personality: The Mechanic displays signs of being scatterbrained and absent-minded, becoming forgetful and easily distracted, leading to humorous situations that make him quite endearing to his acquaintances. This afflicted personality trait makes him prone to getting lost while trying to find or repair a device or missing important appointments, which is why constant surveillance is necessary. 

Addendum: Recently it was discovered that 5028 has a unique ability. When in the presence of malfunctioning machinery, he could attune himself to them, allowing him to instantly diagnose the problem and come up with a solution. Further investigation is undergoing, but for now, this unique trait makes him more valuable to our foundation.
