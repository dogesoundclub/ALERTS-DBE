Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9820 is to be contained in a standard human containment cell at Site-██. The subject is to be provided with all necessary amenities including food and water supply, sanitary facilities, and access to entertainment media as per standard guidelines.

Description: DSC-MATE-9820 is a male human of average build, approximately 1.80 meters in height. The subject's most notable feature is a circular spot around the mouth, which is believed to be a birthmark. DSC-MATE-9820 wears normal glasses and a distinct doge hat on the head. The subject also sports a red victory band on the forehead, a green cross earring on each ear, and a medical mask that is worn at all times.

DSC-MATE-9820 is a skilled mechanic with a particular attention to detail. The subject is highly observant and has an almost photographic memory, making them an asset in various tasks like repairing machinery and investigating anomalies. The subject's personality is characterized by a strong desire to give the perfect gift and to help others.

However, DSC-MATE-9820's gift-giving behavior can also be considered an obsessive quirk. The subject is known to spend a considerable amount of time agonizing over the perfect gift for someone, often researching and studying the person's interests in great detail. This behavior can become problematic when DSC-MATE-9820 becomes overly fixated on the gift-giving process to the detriment of their own well-being.

DSC-MATE-9820 wears a gold chain as an additional accessory, but its significance is currently unknown.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9820 has expressed interest in participating in testing and assisting the Foundation in any way possible. Request for such actions are being reviewed by the Site Director for approval.
