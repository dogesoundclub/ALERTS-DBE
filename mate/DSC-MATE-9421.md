Description: 

9421 is a humanoid of the 'human' species with distinct external features. Most prominent are the spots spread throughout the face; the exact number of spots has not been precisely recorded due to reluctance to be examined. The mouth is almost always stuck in a somewhat frenzied expression; the corners are pulled tight, and the tongue is visible through the slightly opened mouth. 

Eyes of the object are larger than average, with irises of a bright blue color. They often seem to glint with an artful interest in the surrounding world, leading researchers to believe that the personality and the eyes have a correlation.

The head is a vivid shade of 'parted pink' and is always well kept, indicating that hygiene is a high priority. A single earring made of jade decorates the left ear lobe.

When left to free will, 9421 gravitates towards various forms of artistry, and may be found painting, drawing, or writing. This does not seem to interfere with its primary occupation as a programmer but rather as an escape.

In conclusion, 9421 is considered to be a harmless object, and any efforts to limit its interests may negatively impact its mood and daily performance. 

As with all humanoid objects, should any negative change occur, please report it to the containment team immediately.
