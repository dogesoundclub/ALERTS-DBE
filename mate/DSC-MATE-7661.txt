Description: SCP-7661 is a male rabbit, approximately 30cm in height when standing upright. Its eyes are horned rim glasses, and it wears a Doge hat on its head.

SCP-7661 has a unique personality that is both helpful and concerning. It is extremely observant and attentive to details, making it an excellent gift-giver.

Its desire to give the perfect gift can sometimes lead to distress and overthink.

SCP-7661 rarely speaks; it prefers to communicate through physical gestures or with written notes. Despite its lack of verbal communication, it is proficient in driving and ferrying packages, often completing more deliveries in a single day than other delivery drivers.

SCP-7661's ability to understand human language remains unknown, but it shows a high degree of intelligence in completing its job assignments. It has not displayed any unusual behavior or disturbing tendencies during its time at the Foundation, and so it is classified as safe.
