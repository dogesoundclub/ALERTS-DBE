Containment Procedure:
SCP-263 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times, with reinforced steel bars and electrified flooring to prevent escape. No personnel should enter the containment cell unless authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel. Regular feeding and monitoring by security cameras is mandatory.

Description:
SCP-263 is a male monkey, measuring approximately 80cm in height and weighing 35kg. He has a distinctive retro cap on his head with a 2-color band on his forehead. SCP-263 is often seen wearing normal glasses, a gold chain, and constantly holding a candy stick. Even though he is only capable of speaking in short sentences, his vocabulary and intellectual ability have been observed to be on par with an average human.

Personality:
SCP-263 has a highly analytical and logical mindset, which makes him a dangerous adversary. He is particularly fond of making witty observations and teasing his friends in a dry, deadpan way. Though he seems to enjoy bantering with his companions, he never loses sight of his ultimate goal: destruction.

Special Containment Procedures:
Due to SCP-263's skill set and unpredictable behavior, security measures are to be taken around his containment cell at all times. Personnel engaged in guarding SCP-263 must wear protective garments to prevent any malicious gunfire or explosive devices.

In conclusion, SCP-263 represents an irrefutable threat to the safety and well-being of humanity. Its containment remains of utmost importance to prevent significant losses of life and destruction. Any personnel who encounter SCP-263 must follow specific decontamination and evacuation protocols before leaving the area.
