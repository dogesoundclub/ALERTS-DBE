Item #: SCP-1820

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1820 is to be monitored within his place of employment and should not be approached without the presence of at least one Level 2 personnel. Interviews with SCP-1820 must be conducted in a controlled environment with psychological guidance available. SCP-1820 must not have access to any materials that could be considered a danger to himself or others.

Description: SCP-1820 is a human male with a normal blonde haircut and jade earrings. He has a noticeable spot on his mouth, which is often accompanied by a frightened expression. Despite not displaying any anomalous properties, SCP-1820's empathetic and compassionate nature and tendency to take on others' problems as his own have deemed him worthy of containment.

SCP-1820 is a car salesman by profession, and his daily interactions with customers often result in him taking on their personal problems and attempting to find solutions for them. This behavior has led to instances of mental exhaustion and depression in SCP-1820, hence the need for containment.

It is important to note that SCP-1820's personality traits are not inherently dangerous; however, as with any anomalous object or individual, precautionary measures must be taken to ensure the safety of those involved.

Addendum: During a recent interview with SCP-1820, he expressed a desire to help those in containment and requested to be of assistance to the Foundation. The request is currently under review by Level 3 personnel.
