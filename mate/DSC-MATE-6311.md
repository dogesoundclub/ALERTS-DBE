Item #: 6311

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6311 is to be monitored under standard observation protocols for all humanoid anomalies. DSC-MATE-6311 is currently employed as a Car Salesman at [REDACTED] dealership and is to be allowed interaction with the general public for the purpose of their employment.

Description: DSC-MATE-6311 appears to be a typical human male in their late 20s. They stand at 6'2" and have a slender build. However, DSC-MATE-6311 possesses anomalous traits that differ from a baseline human. 

DSC-MATE-6311's head is of an unnatural greenish color that has yet to be identified by any known pigments. Their eyes are notably equipped with VR Jade LED devices, giving it a technological enhancement against standard human eyesight. On DSC-MATE-6311's forehead, a goggle-like device is attached, apparently functioning as an accessory at present. DSC-MATE-6311 has a green cross earring of minor significance on their left earlobe.

Observations of DSC-MATE-6311 suggest they are capable of artistic expressions through a variety of means. Distinguishing traits of their personality include creativity and artistic inclinations, though not to the point of obsession. 

DSC-MATE-6311's speech is routinely filtered through a medical mask, preventing any visible distortion of vocalization for reasons unknown. Constant use of a medical mask is typical and they have displayed discomfort when separated from one.

Further psychological analysis is still ongoing.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6311 has displayed no previously observed anomalous behavior beyond their physical traits and talents. To date, there has been no declared information worth sharing with the public or other involved entities.
