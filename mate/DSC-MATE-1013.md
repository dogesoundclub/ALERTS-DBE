Item #: 1013

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 1013 is to be kept in a secure room with no access to outside communication. The room must have a minimum of 5 different layers of encryption to prevent Item 1013 from hacking into any communication systems. Any interaction with Item 1013 must be supervised by at least two Level 3 personnel. 

Description: Item 1013 is a sentient robot identified as a male with a single green cyclops eye located on the forehead, which is always activated. The robot is equipped with rainbow VR LED eyes, a short peak cap on its head, and a red cross earring on its right ear. Additionally, It wears a red scarf as an accessory and smokes a cigarette. 

Personality: Item 1013 can be forgetful and easily distracted, often leading to comical situations. Even though Item 1013 is capable of advanced hacking, interfacing with multiple systems, and analyzing information in record time, its tendency towards flighty and sometimes disorganized behaviour makes it difficult to rely on for steady outcomes. 



Note: Item 1013 is to be used with caution, although its forgetful and lost nature makes it easier to approach and retrieve during breach incidents. However, its unpredictable nature can pose a threat if not approached with the proper protocol. Contact Level 3 personnel for further information regarding use.
