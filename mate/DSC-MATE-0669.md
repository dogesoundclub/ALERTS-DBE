Item #: DSC-MATE-669

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-669 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with additional security measures in place to prevent escape or unauthorized access. The subject is to be provided with a variety of toys and games to keep them entertained and mentally stimulated, as well as a steady supply of meat to support their carnivorous diet. Due to their potentially unpredictable behavior, all interactions with DSC-MATE-669 must be monitored by at least two armed guards.

Description: DSC-MATE-669 is a male humanoid tiger, measuring approximately 2.1 meters in height and weighing 212.7 kilograms. The subject has a stocky build and a thick coat of orange fur, with black stripes running horizontally across their body. DSC-MATE-669 displays high levels of intelligence, capable of speaking in both English and several other languages, as well as manipulating basic tools and objects.

DSC-MATE-669's eyes are obscured by a pair of nerd glasses, and their head is often covered by a hoodie. The subject also wears a normal gas mask, which serves to filter out toxins and other harmful substances in the air. DSC-MATE-669's personality is characterized by impulsiveness and a desire for attention, often engaging in reckless behavior in order to impress others. However, the subject has also demonstrated a capacity for loyalty and empathy, especially towards those who treat them kindly.

Reports from previous containment sites suggest that DSC-MATE-669 has the ability to enter a state of heightened aggression, often triggered by loud noises or sudden movements. During these episodes, the subject has been observed to display increased strength and stamina, with a correspondingly greater risk of causing harm to others. As such, containment staff are advised to exercise caution while interacting with DSC-MATE-669. 

Addendum: Incident 669-01 - On ██/██/20██, DSC-MATE-669 breached containment and attacked several personnel, causing significant damage to the containment wing. It is currently unknown how the subject managed to undo the security measures in place. Ongoing investigations are underway to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
