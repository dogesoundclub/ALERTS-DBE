SCP-7769, also known as the "Grooming Bunny," is a male rabbit of an unknown breed that works as a beautician. Upon further examination, SCP-7769 has a peculiar two-color band on its forehead that emits a subtle glow. Additionally, SCP-7769 is fitted with a pair of jade earrings and a gold chain, implying a peculiar sense of fashion that might be related to its job.

Perhaps the most unnerving feature of SCP-7769 is the LED gas mask that it sometimes chooses to wear. Although researchers believe it to be purely aesthetic, it is often alarming when SCP-7769 enters a room sporting this unsettling accessory.

SCP-7769's personality adds a layer of intrigue to its character. SCP-7769 is nurturing and cares deeply for others, often taking on a maternal or paternal role towards those close to it. This trait, while endearing, can lead to some comical situations where SCP-7769 overextends itself in its efforts to care for others, treating them as if they were its own children. 

Overall, SCP 7769 stands out as a fascinating character with unique appearance and an endearing personality that makes them a valuable asset in any urban fantasy scenario.
