Item #: 8530

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject is to be contained in a standard living quarters alongside other human subjects. She is permitted to continue her profession as a theater manager, provided that Foundation operatives are stationed within the same building as her workplace at all times.

Description: SCP-8530 is a human female, measuring around 5'7" in height and has several unique physical characteristics. Her face is marked with irregular orange stripes, while her head is completely metallic blue. The subject's glasses are similar to those worn by individuals with poor eyesight. SCP-8530's forehead features a 2 Color Band, and she wears a Jade Earring on each ear. She is often observed wearing a medical mask, and a Silver Chain is wrapped around her neck.

SCP-8530 is generally regarded as a spontaneous individual who occasionally makes impulsive decisions, frequently putting herself in risky situations. For example, she's known for occasional cliff-jumping or river diving. Prior footage shows SCP-8530 showing disregard for her safety, suggesting that she may have no concern for the consequences of her actions.

Personality: SCP-8530 possesses an unpredictable personality, characterized by extreme impulsiveness and risk-taking tendencies. The subject's actions often leave her unsuspecting acquaintances or friends perplexed and unable to keep up with her rapid change of plans. The subject's resistance to social conventions serves as a defense mechanism that potentially masks a deeper underlying psychological issue.

Addendum: SCP-8530's behavior has been observed to be intrinsically linked to her job as a theater manager, with the subject's extreme mood changes recorded when taking extended breaks from managing the theater. It is unknown at present if there is an anomalous effect within the theater associated with the subject. Further monitoring and experiments are required to determine the extent of SCP-8530's abilities.
