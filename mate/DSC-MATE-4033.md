Item #: 4033

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4033 is to be monitored at all times and is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to the subject is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher and all interactions with the subject must be supervised by at least 2 security personnel at all times. Subject 4033 is to be provided with necessary electronic equipment to carry out their job as a programmer.

Description: Subject 4033 is a human female, approximately 28 years old. She has spots on her face, a prominent red lip, and red clown eyes. Her hair is styled in two pig-tails and has gold earrings with a gold chain as an accessory. The subject is often seen wearing an LED gas mask around their neck. Their appearance suggests that they may have been involved in the circus or performance arts. 

Subject 4033's personality is that of a caring and nurturing individual. They possess a great deal of empathy for others and often go out of their way to take care of friends and family members as if they were their own children. This trait can sometimes lead to humorous situations, as they have been observed performing tasks such as cutting up food for coworkers or reminding them to layer up during colder months.

Despite her natural inclination towards being compassionate, there are times where Subject 4033 has exhibited a dangerous level of obsessive behavior towards individuals she becomes close to or perceives as being helpless. This behavior has resulted in past incidents of stalking and has caused concern for those who work with and around her.

Addendum: Following Incident 4033-01, all interactions with Subject 4033 must be conducted with caution, and additional security measures must be at hand. Contact Dr. ███████ for further information.
