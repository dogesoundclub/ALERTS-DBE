SCP-8390, also known as "The Jester", is a peculiar human delivery driver with spot-covered skin and striking red lips that seem to be always grinning. The most remarkable feature of this anomalous individual are her eyes, which have been observed to be blood-red and resembling those of a clown, making it difficult for the uninitiated to look her straight in the face.

On top of her head, SCP-8390 constantly wears a tiara that glimmers in the light and implies some sort of royalty or superiority complex. Complementing her regal style, she dons golden earrings that dangle on her elongated ears, giving her an almost elf-like appearance.

For unknown reasons, The Jester worships the obscure and the bizarre, as seen in her choice of accessories that include a silver chain with unknown inscriptions and an LED gas mask, which surely doesn't help to reduce her already-strange look.

Despite her freakish looks, SCP-8390 is amiable and humorous, earning a reputation for her wit and love of discussion. However, her playful banter can sometimes go too far for comfort, leading her to engage needlessly in debates that can cause problems for her and her associates.

Under no circumstances should SCP-8390's conversation topics delve too deeply into anything that could potentially disturb her, as it is unknown what might transpire if she is pushed too far. Special care must be taken in handling her deliveries, as her questionable taste and interests might cause unexpected events to unfold.
