Item #: DSC-MATE-1128

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1128 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. DSC-MATE-1128's access to electrical equipment outside of testing is to be restricted unless authorized by Level-3 personnel or higher. DSC-MATE-1128's interactions with personnel are to be monitored at all times for any unusual behavior or manifestation of anomalous activity.

Description: DSC-MATE-1128 is a human male of average height and build, with a permanent smile on his face. The subject's eyes are obscured by normal prescription glasses, giving no unusual details. DSC-MATE-1128 sports a unique two-color band on his forehead, which appears to be an intrinsic part of the subject's physiology. DSC-MATE-1128 also wears a silver chain as part of his normal attire.

DSC-MATE-1128's personality is characterized by a deep curiosity about the world and a thirst for knowledge. DSC-MATE-1128's enthusiasm for learning may lead to the subject randomly spouting off obscure facts or trivia to others, often leading to humorous situations. DSC-MATE-1128 also shows a particular aptitude for electrical systems, working as an electrician in the past.

DSC-MATE-1128's anomalous properties appear when in direct contact with electrical equipment. DSC-MATE-1128 can interact with electronic devices in an unusually efficient manner, often displaying near-perfect electrical awareness, even with devices that are atypical or experimental. DSC-MATE-1128's abilities are also augmented by an unknown force, manifesting in various unexplained phenomena, such as sudden electrical surges or sensory hallucinations among the observers.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-1128 was recovered after reports of unusual electrical activity coming from a city power plant. The investigation led the Foundation to discover DSC-MATE-1128, working as an electrician at the site, after tracking the source of the disturbance. DSC-MATE-1128 willingly cooperated with the Foundation upon discovery, voluntarily submitting to initial testing and containment. Initial testing shows that DSC-MATE-1128's abilities appear to be passive, and the subject displays no awareness of his own anomalous properties, indicating non-malicious intent. Further research is ongoing.
