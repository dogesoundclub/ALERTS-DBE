Item #: 4194

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4194 is to remain at large, as they operate as a reporter for a local newspaper. They are known to the public as a tiger of indeterminate origin wearing a bucket hat, nerd glasses, and a medical mask. They are also commonly seen with a jade earring and a red scarf. Individuals that become suspicious of their true nature and abilities are to be administered Class-B amnestics immediately.

Description: SCP-4194 is a male tiger of unknown origin. It is suspected that they are a result of a successful hybridization experiment between a Sumatran or Bengal tiger and an unknown anthropomorphic species. They display human-like traits, such as the ability to reason and make use of tools, and communicate fluently in various languages.

Their appearance is partially concealed with a medical mask, hiding their mouth, and with a bucket hat which covers their head. They are also frequently seen with various accessories, including nerd glasses, a jade earring, and a red scarf. SCP-4194's voice is modulated through a device present under the mask, allowing them to speak fluently while maintaining their anonymity.

SCP-4194 displays a personality that can be described as dry and deadpan. They have a talent for humor that often catches people off guard, which they deliver in a calm, collected manner. Despite not considering themselves the life of the party, their humor is surprisingly entertaining.

Addendum: The Foundation has been monitoring SCP-4194 for some time now, as they possess abilities that are not typically associated with their species. Although their existence is not known to the general public, it is still critical to contain and monitor SCP-4194 to prevent any potential breaches of secrecy.
