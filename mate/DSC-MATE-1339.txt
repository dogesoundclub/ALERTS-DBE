Item #: SCP-1339

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1339 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be provided with a steady supply of meat, preferably of the red meat variety, and is to undergo regular psychological evaluations. Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-1339, as it has shown a tendency towards assertive behavior.

Description: SCP-1339 is a male tiger whose physical appearance does not deviate significantly from that of a typical tiger. However, it has developed several distinct features including blue clown eyes, a red beanie on its head, a red scarf around its neck, and a candy stick in its mouth. While SCP-1339's physical features are noteworthy, it is its personality that truly sets it apart.

SCP-1339 has a natural talent for leadership and frequently takes control of situations. This characteristic is evident in all aspects of its life, from its profession as a beautician to its social interactions. SCP-1339 has demonstrated an ability to inspire and motivate those around it, often achieving impressive results in the process. Its leadership skills make it a valuable asset when working with others, but it can become aggressive and overbearing if its commands are disregarded.

Addendum: SCP-1339's origins are unknown, and it was first brought to the Foundation's attention when it was captured in a circus where it was being used as an attraction. SCP-1339 was detained after reports from witnesses claiming it had "hypnotized" audience members into following its orders. Further investigation revealed no evidence of hypnotic abilities, but SCP-1339's leadership skills are still a cause for concern.
