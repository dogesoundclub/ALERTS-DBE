Special Containment Procedures: 3247 is to be kept in an urban area where it can fulfill its job as a reporter while being monitored at all times.

Description: SCP-3247 is a male tiger with blue bandana on its head, a gold earring, and a goggle on the forehead. It also wears a gold chain necklace and carries candy stick. They stand approximately 2 meters tall and weigh approximately 300 kilograms. Upon initial capture, 3247 displayed signs of fear, frequently having its mouth in a frightened position. Further observation revealed it to be highly analytical and logical, often engaging in debates or arguments with others for fun. These debates can become intense, even if others find the topic to be trivial or unimportant. 

SCP-3247 was discovered in a heavily populated urban area, working as a reporter for one of the local news outlets. Further investigation revealed it to be highly skilled at its job and a respected member of the industry. It has demonstrated the ability to communicate fluently in multiple languages, making it highly adaptable to any environment. 

SCP-3247 exhibits no signs of aggression towards humans or other animals, preferring to remain calm and reserved in situations that would typically cause a response of fear or anger. It appears to have no knowledge of its situation as an anomaly, believing itself to be a normal part of the environment. 

Addendum: Due to SCP-3247's ability to gather information and adapt to any situation, it has been suggested that it be used for covert operations by the Foundation. However, this proposal has been denied by higher-ups due to the potential risk of exposure and the danger it could pose to the general public.
