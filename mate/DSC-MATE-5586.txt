Item #: 5586

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 5586 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a secure locking mechanism. Access to 5586 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, who must wear full body protective gear and gas masks when interacting with the subject.

Description: 5586 is a male fashion designer who appears to be of the primate genus. It stands approximately 1.5 meters tall and has a frightened mouth with horned rim glasses as its eyes. It wears a Doge hat on top of its head, and it has a 2 color band on its forehead. The subject's most prominent accessory is an LED gas mask which emits a bright light when in use. In a calm state, the mask's LED lights up in various hues of blue and green.

5586 has a particularly strong sense of empathy, often being keenly attuned to the emotional state of others. The subject's ability to influence the mood of others is heightened due to its fashion designing skills, which allow it to make appropriate dress choices that enhance or de-emphasize particular physical features.

Addendum: 5586's emotional influence appears to have an anomalous effect. Subjects that come in contact with 5586 tend to experience increased levels of happiness, and this effect appears to persist even after contact with the subject has ended. This behavior has led to 5586 being used in a therapy capacity to help individuals manage depression and anxiety symptoms.

Note: 5586 is considered cooperative and docile; however, due to the anomalous properties of its gas mask, strict containment procedures must be followed to minimize the risk of exposure to potential side effects.
