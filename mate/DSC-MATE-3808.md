Item #: 3808

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3808 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. Access to the chamber and subject is only granted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Subject 3808 is allowed to keep their choker accessory and cigarettes, but both items must be inspected for any anomalies before being returned.

Description: Subject 3808 is a human female in her mid-thirties, with spotted facial features and bright red lips. They wear normal glasses and sport a blonde ushanka on their head with a two-color band across their forehead. Subject 3808 also has green cross earrings as well as a choker accessory, and is often seen smoking a cigarette.

Subject 3808 currently holds the position of Theater Manager at the ████ Theater in downtown █████████. They are known to have a strong and decisive personality, and are not afraid to be bossy or intimidating to ensure that things are done efficiently and effectively. Despite this, they are highly respected by their employees and colleagues.

Subject 3808 has no known anomalous properties, but due to their role in managing the theater, it is important to monitor their activities and interactions with patrons and staff to ensure the security of Site-███.

Addendum: Subject 3808 has expressed interest in collaborating with the Foundation on a future production at the ████ Theater. This proposal is currently under review by Site-███ administration.
