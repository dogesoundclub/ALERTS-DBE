Item #: SCP-4534

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4534 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-[REDACTED]. Access to SCP-4534 is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. SCP-4534 is to receive regular medical check-ups and examinations to monitor any potential side-effects from exposure to anomalous phenomena.

Description: SCP-4534 is a female human of approximately 32 years of age. SCP-4534's most prominent feature is the presence of distinctive orange stripes on her face. SCP-4534's eyes are also orange, with an eyebrow of the same color. SCP-4534's head is styled in two pig tails, with a forehead adorned with a two color band. SCP-4534's ears are pierced and bear a jade earring. SCP-4534 regularly dons a medical mask and wears a gold chain as an accessory.

SCP-4534's primary occupation prior to containment was that of a train driver. SCP-4534 had no anomalous abilities prior to being exposed to an anomalous event while operating a train. SCP-4534 is unable to recall the specifics of the event, but following exposure, SCP-4534 began to exhibit signs of absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. SCP-4534 is now prone to losing track of time and forgetting appointments.

SCP-4534's behavior is otherwise normal and cooperative, and no further anomalous behavior has been observed to-date. However, SCP-4534 is to be monitored closely for any potential changes in behavior or abilities. As such, SCP-4534 is to remain in containment until further notice.

Addendum: At the request of SCP-4534, a small terrarium has been provided in SCP-4534's containment cell. SCP-4534 has stated that observing the termites within the terrarium helps to alleviate stress and anxiety. The terrarium is to be regularly maintained by designated staff members.
