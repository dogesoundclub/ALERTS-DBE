Description: SCP-7413 is a male human of average height, with a pair of notable nerd glasses covering his eyes, and a hoodie covering his head. SCP-7413 has a distinctive 2-color band on its forehead, which changes color depending on its mood. SCP-7413 can often be seen carrying a candy stick, which it utilizes to alleviate stress and anxiety.

SCP-7413 works as a news anchor, delivering headlines both local and global to the public. While in public, SCP-7413 exhibits a calm and composed demeanor, but in private, it can be a bit scatterbrained and forgetful, often getting sidetracked easily. SCP-7413's forgetfulness has led to humorous situations, such as forgetting important appointments or getting lost while trying to find a new place.

It has been determined that SCP-7413 possesses a form of telepathy, which it uses to influence human perception and behavior. SCP-7413 has used this ability to advance its career, climbing the corporate ladder to become one of the most prominent news anchors in the city. It is unknown if SCP-7413 has additional abilities or if there are any other entities like it.

Addendum: The Foundation has reason to believe that SCP-7413 may not exist in a singular being, but rather a collective of individual entities. Further research is required to confirm this hypothesis. Anyone with information regarding SCP-7413 is to contact Foundation officials immediately.
