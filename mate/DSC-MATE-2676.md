Item #: 2676

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Item 2676 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel must be trained in tiger handling procedures before entering the cell, and are required to wear protective gear at all times. Access to Item 2676 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above.

Description: Item 2676 appears to be a male tiger with a red beanie on its head and a red cross earring on its left ear. Its glasses seem to be nerd glasses, and it often carries a candy stick in its mouth. Item 2676 exhibits a frightened mouth expression and can appear timid and shy at times.

Personality: Despite its fearsome appearance, Item 2676 has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, particularly towards its job as a theater manager. It often takes on more than it can handle, leading to humorous situations such as attempting to carry too many things at once or trying to fit all its tasks into a single day. Nevertheless, it remains dedicated and hardworking in its position.

Addendum: During a routine medical checkup, it was discovered that Item 2676 possesses a unique genetic mutation that allows it to understand and speak human languages fluently. While this mutation is not fully understood, it has resulted in Item 2676 being able to communicate effectively with foundation personnel. Further research is ongoing.
