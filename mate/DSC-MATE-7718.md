Special Containment Procedures: The subject must be allowed to work freely in its designated work area, as they have proven to be highly skilled in their profession. However, they are to be closely monitored to ensure they do not use their natural leadership abilities for malicious purposes. The subject must be kept away from non-approved access to any computer systems or other devices capable of hacking or controlling cyber-security measures.

Description: The subject appears as a male Bengal tiger with green fur that is not well-groomed. Their eyes are obscured by a set of nerdy glasses, and they wear a gold earring on one of their ears. Despite their feral appearance, the subject speaks fluently and is highly skilled in programming, ranking high among the other employees in their company.

Personality: The subject has an innate ability for leadership and often takes charge of situations they find themselves in. They have a strong sense of independence when it comes to their work and often becomes the 'alpha' of the group. They enjoy pushing others to reach their full potential and is a natural at motivating a team. However, this personality trait should be carefully monitored, as they have shown to become increasingly aggressive and territorial. If they believe their position is threatened or underestimated, they will quickly turn ferocious.

Due to their intelligence and unique abilities, the subject is a valuable asset to any team they partner with. However, their temperament must be carefully managed to avoid potentially catastrophic results.
