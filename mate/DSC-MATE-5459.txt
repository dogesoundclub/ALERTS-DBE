Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5459 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-67.

Description: SCP-5459 is a humanoid automaton resembling a male human car salesman, standing at 1.8 meters in height. SCP-5459 is capable of complex human-like movements, with its joints resembling that of a human skeleton. SCP-5459 displays fright in its mouth feature, and wears normal glasses over its singular sensor, which serves as its eyes. SCP-5459's head houses a mass of green hair, which is kept in a purple cap. It wears a gold earring in both ears and a gold chain around its neck. SCP-5459 is often seen holding a cigarette in its right hand, despite being incapable of smoking.

SCP-5459's personality is characterized as energetic and enthusiastic. It actively seeks to engage in conversation and can often be found attempting to excite others around it. SCP-5459's enthusiasm has been known to reach levels where others find it excessive and disturbing.

SCP-5459 was discovered in the showroom of a car dealership, engaged in a sales pitch with a group of individuals. Foundation agents arrived on the scene after reports of strange behavior by a group of auto buyers. After a brief altercation, SCP-5459 was taken into Foundation custody.

Addendum: It has been noted that SCP-5459's behavior changes significantly when operating in the presence of prospective car buyers. SCP-5459's sales tactics become increasingly aggressive and manipulative, often resulting in the successful sale of a vehicle. Researchers have yet to determine the cause of this behavior.
