DESIGNATION: "The Mechanic"

SPECIES: Homo sapiens

GENDER: Female

DESCRIPTION: The Mechanic is a human female with distinguished features. One of her most notable features is her purple lips, contrasting against her fair complexion. Her eyebrow color is an orangish hue, which gives her an intense aura. The Mechanic dons a bucket hat atop her head, which obscures most of her hair. There are goggles on her forehead which seem to serve as an accessory more than a tool. She wears a jade earring in each ear, which could potentially contain anomalous properties. The Mechanic is often seen wearing a gas mask, which appears to be a regular type, possibly to protect her from hazardous materials.

PERSONALITY: The Mechanic is a driven individual with a strong desire to improve the world around her. Although her intentions are sincere and genuine, they can cause her to become overly passionate, leading to questionable actions. She is not afraid to take a stand for what she believes in, and her comments and actions often have a humorous and ironic twist. Her motivations may be noble, but her behavior can raise some eyebrows within the Foundation.

CAUTION: Approach with caution. Although not hostile, The Mechanic's actions and beliefs can be unpredictable. If in doubt, contact your higher-up for guidance.
