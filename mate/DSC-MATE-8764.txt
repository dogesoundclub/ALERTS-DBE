Addendum: Discovery Log

SCP-8764 was first discovered when reports of unusual behavior at a local charity event were reported to the Foundation. Witnesses described SCP-8764 using unusual comedic methods to persuade attendees to donate significantly more money than they intended to. An investigation revealed that several individuals had given the subject large sums of money without explanation.

Further investigation confirmed that SCP-8764's charm had caused the individuals to act out of character. The subject was subsequently identified and detained for questioning. SCP-8764's behavior has been observed and analyzed, but no definitive anomalous effect has been identified at this time.
