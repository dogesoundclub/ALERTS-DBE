Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9610 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be cleaned and disinfected every day by D-class personnel, and DSC-MATE-9610 should be provided with a standard diet for tigers. Any breach to containment is to be reported immediately to a Level 4 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-9610 is a male tiger with red clown eyes and a frightened mouth. DSC-MATE-9610's head is adorned with a police cap with a red victory band, and his ears have a red cross earring. DSC-MATE-9610 constantly wears a medical mask over his mouth. DSC-MATE-9610 has gained notoriety among Foundation personnel due to his uncanny ability to anthropomorphize everyday objects, such as his car or household appliances.

One of DSC-MATE-9610's most distinctive features is his almost obsessive care for objects around him. DSC-MATE-9610 is highly nurturing and caring, extending his compassion to inanimate objects. However, DSC-MATE-9610's care can also be highly damaging, as he has been known to take unnecessary risks to "protect" objects.

DSC-MATE-9610's background before containing is highly mysterious. However, Foundation agents recovered DSC-MATE-9610 from a burning building in ██████, where he had been functioning as a Firefighter before collection. 

DSC-MATE-9610 is highly intelligent and has shown exceptional problem-solving skills in the past. However, he has an almost manic fixation on taking care of things around him, and this can lead to destructive behavior. Speculation about the biological factors that lead to this fixation has been made, but without enough information to draw any concrete conclusions.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9610's strange behavior towards inanimate objects has not changed during containment, showing that his personality is seemingly set in stone. Experiments are ongoing to understand this fixation better, and researchers are looking into possible therapies that could mitigate these uncontrolled behaviors.
