Item #: 1449 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 1449 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, lined with soundproofing materials. Subject is allowed minimal contact with personnel and visitors, and an armed guard is present whenever interactions occur. Any requests made by subject must be thoroughly vetted and approved by a Level 3 or higher personnel. 

Description: 1449 appears to be an average human male in his early thirties. Subject's face is heavily marked with spots, and they possess a large, exaggerated clown mouth. Scarring on their forehead suggests a previous injury, now concealed by a red victory band. Subject's eyes are red and resemble those of a clown, and they wear a medical mask typically used in surgical procedures. Their attire consists of a standard fast-food worker uniform, complemented by a red scarf and a gold earring. 

The personality of subject 1449 is characterized by their extreme attention to detail, with a tendency to become obsessed with organization and order in their surroundings. This compulsive behavior may manifest in unusual ways, such as alphabetizing their spice racks or color-coding their closets. This trait makes the subject an excellent employee, but their erratic behavior poses a danger to themselves and others. 

Subject 1449's anomalous properties become active when they are exposed to noise or loud voices. This causes a sudden and intense change in behavior, with subject becoming hostile and aggressive. Attempts to subdue the subject with force are ineffective, as they possess above-average strength and durability. It is recommended that all personnel avoid subjects that may trigger this behavior. 

Addendum: It is suspected that subject 1449's exposure to an unknown anomalous item may have caused the onset of their compulsive behavior and physical changes. Further research is underway to identify and contain this anomaly.
