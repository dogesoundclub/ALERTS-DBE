Item #: 1263

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Agent 1263 is to be monitored at all times and is required to report to the Foundation for monthly check-ins. She is to be kept away from any anomalous objects or situations that may trigger her abnormal abilities.

Description: Agent 1263 is a female human of average height and build, with a contagious smile that can put anyone at ease. However, her eyes are the most remarkable feature, as they are of a piercing bright blue color, resembling clown eyes.

Her head is adorned with not arranged green hair that is often tied back in a ponytail. A 2 color band runs across her forehead, giving her a tribal look. Agent 1263 wears a pair of jade earrings that have no anomalous properties.

Agency interviews confirm that Agent 1263 tends to be very practical and hands-on, often devising unconventional solutions to problems at hand. She can repair broken objects with common duct tape, paper clips, and other ordinary tools. She is known to rig up solutions to complicated problems that others would deem too difficult.

Agent 1263 is known to carry a cigarette with her at all times, which is believed to be a coping mechanism for her past traumatic experiences.

Addendum: Agent 1263 has demonstrated the ability to detect anomalous objects and detect anomalies from their interaction with the world, although she has not yet been able to control this ability. This puts her in a delicate position and highlights the need for strict monitoring to ensure she doesn't come into harm's way.
