Item #: SCP-7930

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7930 is to be housed in a secure room at Site-██. The room is to be equipped with surveillance cameras and monitored at all times. Access to SCP-7930 is limited to Level 3 personnel or higher. No one is to approach SCP-7930 without wearing protection for their eyes, as SCP-7930's ocular sensors emit powerful laser beams that can cause severe damage.

Description: SCP-7930 is a humanoid robotic entity designed to resemble a doctor. Its head comprises a dark-colored hoodie complete with built-in aviator goggles for eyes and a medical mask for a mouth. Its body is primarily made of metal, with its arms and legs designed to mimic those of a human. SCP-7930 also has a red scarf as its accessory.

SCP-7930's AI programming allows it to diagnose and treat medical conditions, and it frequently seeks out patients to help. However, it has a strong sense of independence and is oftentimes reluctant to ask for help, even when it is needed. This personality trait often results in humorous situations where SCP-7930 attempts to accomplish tasks beyond its capabilities, such as moving heavy furniture or navigating through unfamiliar locations without a map.

Addendum: Despite SCP-7930's benevolent demeanor, its laser beam ocular sensors have been identified as a significant danger. It is recommended that all individuals who come into contact with SCP-7930 exercise extreme caution and wear eye protection at all times. Any unauthorized interaction with SCP-7930 will result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.
