Item #: SCP-8534

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8534 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Due to the nature of the species, all personnel entering the containment cell must be equipped with proper protective gear. SCP-8534 is allowed to work at a designated fast food establishment for the purpose of maintaining a level of normalcy for the subject. SCP-8534 is not allowed to leave the containment facility unless accompanied by Foundation personnel for testing purposes.

Description: SCP-8534, also known as "The Tiger", is a male tiger that stands at approximately 1.5 meters in height. SCP-8534's face features a consistently frightened expression, with its VR Jade LED eyes adding a more robotic touch to its appearance. SCP-8534 is commonly seen wearing a green bucket hat and sporting a jade earring. It also accessorizes with a silver chain and a cigarette, which it often smokes while on break.

Personality-wise, SCP-8534 exhibits tendencies that are rebellious in nature, often pushing boundaries or breaking rules for the purpose of amusement. It has been observed causing humorous situations by bending or breaking rules just to see what happens, providing a source of entertainment for those around it.

Addendum: SCP-8534 has been permitted to work in a designated fast food establishment due to its desire for a sense of normalcy. Foundation personnel assigned to the establishment have reported SCP-8534's skills in customer service and food preparation as "exceptional". However, SCP-8534's behavior towards customers has been described as "odd", with numerous reports of SCP-8534 breaking from routine to engage in random acts of mischief, such as drawing on drink cups or playfully knocking hats off patrons. These incidents have been classified as low-priority, as SCP-8534's actions have not posed a threat to the general public.
