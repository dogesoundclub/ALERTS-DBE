Item #: SCP-6948

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6948 is to be kept in a secure, soundproof enclosure at all times. Access is strictly limited to Level 3 personnel, who must undergo a full psychological evaluation prior to any interaction. Feeding and care duties are to be carried out remotely using robotic arms.

Description: SCP-6948 is a male rabbit of the Leporidae family, descended from a long line of anthropomorphic rabbits. It is estimated to be approximately 35 years of age, and is able to communicate fluently in multiple human languages. SCP-6948 is notable for its natural charm and charisma, which can have hypnotic effects on those it interacts with.

SCP-6948 wears normal glasses and a purple cap with green hair. Its forehead features a two-color band, and it is often seen wearing a silver chain. SCP-6948 is employed as a banker and is able to manipulate financial markets with relative ease by influencing the decision-making processes of those around it.

SCP-6948's natural charm and charisma can manifest in a variety of ways, from telling jokes to doing silly dances in order to make others laugh. However, it is important to maintain a safe distance from this SCP, as its abilities can lead to loss of inhibitions in other individuals, resulting in potentially hazardous situations.

Addendum: Following a breach incident in which SCP-6948 escaped its enclosure, it became necessary to sedate and re-contain the SCP. During this process, it was discovered that SCP-6948 had been manipulating the financial markets of several major cities in order to enrich itself. Further study is required to determine the extent of SCP-6948's capabilities and its potential impact on global finances.
