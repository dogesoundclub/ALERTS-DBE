Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1269 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. DSC-MATE-1269 is allowed access to a sewing machine, fabrics, and other materials to allow for creative expression. Access to the internet is allowed with supervision.

DSC-MATE-1269 is allowed to continue their work as a fashion designer under the guise of a separate identity. Any public appearances are to be approved and monitored by Foundation personnel. DSC-MATE-1269 is not to reveal their true identity under any circumstances.

Description: DSC-MATE-1269 is a male human with unusual facial features. Orange stripes are present on both sides of their face, resembling the markings of a tiger. Their eyes are obscured by black nerd glasses. DSC-MATE-1269 often wears a green bucket hat and a red victory band across their forehead. A jade earring is present on their left ear, and they often wear a red scarf around their neck.

An LED gas mask is also worn at all times, which allows DSC-MATE-1269 to breathe comfortably in a variety of environments. DSC-MATE-1269 has stated that they prefer the anonymity the mask provides, as it allows them to focus on their work without being approached by fans or critics.

DSC-MATE-1269's fashion designs are highly sought-after in underground circles, with particular popularity among individuals associated with anomalous activities. DSC-MATE-1269's creations often incorporate anomalous materials or properties, such as indestructible fabrics, camouflage cloaks, and even garments designed to enhance the wearer's abilities.

DSC-MATE-1269's personality is described as absent-minded and forgetful, with a tendency to become lost in thought when working on a project. DSC-MATE-1269's memory lapses have resulted in missed appointments and deadlines, but their creative output is highly valued by Foundation personnel.

Addendum: During routine testing, DSC-MATE-1269 refused to remove their LED gas mask for an extended period. Psychological evaluations revealed heightened anxiety and paranoia. DSC-MATE-1269 claimed that they were being watched by an unknown entity, and that removing the mask would put their life in danger. Further investigation revealed no evidence of any outside interference, and DSC-MATE-1269's anxiety has been attributed to their overactive imagination. Containment procedures have been updated to include regular psychiatric evaluations.
