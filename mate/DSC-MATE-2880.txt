Item: SCP-2880

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2880 is to be tracked at all times and monitored through GPS and CCTV systems. Personnel are to maintain a distance of at least 20 meters from SCP-2880 and should not attempt physical contact. Any attempts to interact with SCP-2880 should be made through a soundproof glass interface. SCP-2880 is to be kept in a specially designed containment unit, resembling a train cabin, at all times. All personnel involved with SCP-2880 should undergo a psychological evaluation before and after any interaction with the entity.

Description: SCP-2880 is a male tiger with jade LED eyes, commonly found in electronic devices. The subject wears a red cross earring on his left ear and a distinctive Doge hat. SCP-2880 exhibits a rebellious and impulsive personality and enjoys pushing boundaries. The entity is a train driver by profession, meaning that it requires a daily routine of operating trains and hence poses a significant danger to civilians. The subject employs his position with malicious intent, purposely bending the rules to see what happens. SCP-2880 can cause significant harm to others through deliberate train accidents, which make difficult its containment. SCP-2880 has the appearance of a normal Siberian tiger but exhibits a high level of intelligence and personality resembling that of a human.

Addendum: Further research into SCP-2880's origin and acquisition is ongoing. Psychologists have clarified that the entity's rebellious behavior is a response to trauma from an untold event in SCP-2880's past, and that the entity requires therapy to regulate its behavior. SCP-2880's containment procedures are being redesigned to include psychological manipulation and counseling to help the entity come into terms with its past trauma. Despite its unpredictable behavior, SCP-2880 is a valuable asset in guiding researchers to new avenues of research into advanced animal intelligence.
