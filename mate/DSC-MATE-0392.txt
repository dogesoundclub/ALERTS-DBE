Item #: 392

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 392 is to be monitored during her shift as a veterinarian to ensure she does not engage in any unusual behavior that would expose her true nature. She is to be allowed to leave the containment facility at the end of her shift, but not without first undergoing a psychological evaluation.

Description: Subject 392 appears to be a human female of average build with distinctive spots on her face as one of her distinct facial features. Her eyes are covered by normal glasses, and she often wears a gold chain around her neck. She typically sports a beaming smile on her face, exuding pleasantness and cheerfulness to everyone she interacts with. However, some of her more unusual behavior includes the heavy use of cigarettes as an accessory and her unusual hairstyle of a 00s schoolgirl.

Subject 392 is known for her formidable ethics and obligations to her job as a veterinarian, making sure the animals she treats are always taken care of. Despite her serious attitude towards work, she always knows how to loosen up and enjoy herself. Subject 392 has brought us much amusement with her surprising dance moves and silly antics on the dance floor at social events. 

Under close observation, subject 392 has revealed to possess abilities beyond human norms, able to communicate with animals in a way that defies explanation. Her behavior raises the question of what other extraordinary capabilities she is capable of.

Addendum: Due to her charisma and outgoing nature, subject 392 has been influential in improving the morale of this facility, with multiple members of staff confessing they feel much happier when she is around to lighten the mood. However, her true nature remains unknown and could potentially possess a threat to normal human society. Therefore, she must be kept under our watchful supervision.
