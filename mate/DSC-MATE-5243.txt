Item #: SCP-5243

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5243 is to be kept under surveillance at all times by the Foundation. It is to be treated with caution and monitored for any abnormal behavior. It has been assigned the job of a security guard with access to only level 2 clearance areas.

Description: SCP-5243 is a male human with red clown eyes and a peak spike on its head. It wears a red scarf and an LED gas mask. The subject is a natural brainstormer and enjoys coming up with new and creative ideas. This can lead to some humorous situations, such as suggesting outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react. The accessory has been found to be harmless to humans, making it less harmful.

SCP-5243's natural trait of generating ideas becomes excessive when it is exposed to any form of mental or emotional stress. At this point, it becomes prone to producing numerous dangerous and potentially hazardous concepts.

Addendum: Testing results show that SCP-5243â€™s imaginative capabilities prove immensely profitable when paired with a focus on containment and protection methods. As such, it has been tactfully deployed as a resource to augment Site defenses against breaches- seeing as its nature may pose a risk to any longstanding projects or scientific research conducted by the Foundation.
