However, her stubbornness may also be a liability in certain situations, making her overly cautious at times. 

In conclusion, SCP-638 is a charismatic human with an unconventional appearance and an independent personality that adds depth to her character. Although her sense of self-reliance may lead to some humorously awkward situations, her bravery and determination make her an essential asset to her team.
