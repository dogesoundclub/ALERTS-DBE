Item #: 1210

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1210 is to be treated as a standard human traffic officer, and her movements should be monitored closely during working hours. Any unusual behavior that might indicate a breach of containment must be reported to the Site Director immediately.

Description: SCP-1210 is a female human of average height and build, with an unusual appearance that sets her apart from other people. She has multiple spots on her face, along with purple lips and orange eyebrows. SCP-1210's head resembles that of a pink rabbit, and she has two color bands on her forehead. The subject's ears are adorned with gold earrings, and she wears a medical mask as a mouth cover.

SCP-1210 has a silver chain around her neck, which she frequently plays with during her shifts. Her personality is outgoing and affable, and she seems to have a natural talent for making people laugh. She often tells jokes and performs silly dances to lighten the mood, making her an instant hit with colleagues and passersby alike.

SCP-1210 has displayed no anomalous activity to date, but her appearance and behavior could attract unwanted attention that might result in a breach of containment. For this reason, SCP-1210 is to be contained in her current position as a traffic officer in a major metropolitan area, where her odd features will blend seamlessly with the urban landscape.

Discovery: SCP-1210 was discovered by chance during a routine traffic stop in [REDACTED]. A responding officer contacted the Foundation after becoming suspicious of the subject's outward appearance and reported her to be behaving erratically. A team of Foundation agents dispatched to the scene confirmed SCP-1210's anomalous nature and placed her under containment. Since then, SCP-1210 has been kept under close observation, with no adverse effects reported. 

Addendum: SCP-1210 appears to be more resistant to various forms of trauma than the average human. She has been involved in several traffic accidents, with no permanent physical injuries. It is unclear at this time if this is a result of her anomalous nature or just a mundane trait. Further testing is required to confirm.
