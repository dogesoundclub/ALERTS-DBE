Item #: 6285

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-6285 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with access to all basic necessities. Any technology that could interfere with the normal functioning of DSC-MATE-6285's Bluetooth-enabled audio system is strictly prohibited. Daily check-ins must be performed to ensure the well-being of DSC-MATE-6285.

Description: DSC-MATE-6285 is a sapient rabbit, standing at approximately 1 meter in height. It appears to be a male and wears a retro cap, a gold chain, and a normal gas mask. It possesses blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth, which may indicate distress, anxiety, or paranoia.

DSC-MATE-6285 displays a highly organized and efficient personality, which can be perceived as controlling. It enjoys taking charge in group projects and delegating tasks to others in a matter-of-fact way. Despite this, DSC-MATE-6285 can exhibit humorous and lighthearted behavior, which makes it easy to interact with.

DSC-MATE-6285's most notable attribute is its Bluetooth-enabled audio system, which it uses to communicate with its handlers and other DSCs. This audio system has the ability to amplify DSC-MATE-6285's voice to deafening levels, which severely limits the ability for anyone within earshot to hear anything else.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-6285 was acquired by the Foundation after a report was received from the local police department regarding an unusually efficient and demanding police officer with a gas mask and a talking rabbit partner. DSC-MATE-6285 is currently being trained for use in undercover operations and in the containment and discovery of other anomalous objects.
