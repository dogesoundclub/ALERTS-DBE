SCP-6802 is a female human police officer with unique physical characteristics that make her distinguishable from other officers. She possesses spotted skin that covers her whole body, which is a feature that has not been observed in any other human individual. Her face is covered with a medical mask, while her head is adorned with a purple cap with a headset that she uses to communicate with her colleagues. She wears a green cross earring on her right ear, which holds some unknown significance for her.

The officer is also seen wearing a gold chain around her neck, adding to her unconventional appearance. Her personality is notable for being excessively caring and nurturing towards almost everything she encounters. She has a soft spot for inanimate objects and often assigns them names, talks to them and gives them personalities. The objects include her car, plants, household appliances, and many others. Her tendency to anthropomorphize non-living objects is intriguing but still requires further investigation.

We have observed that when SCP-6802 communicates with other individuals, she tends to be overly concerned about their welfare, making her a valuable asset in cases that involve vulnerable members of society. Her unconventional personality and physical appearance have made her an object of scrutiny and curiosity to her colleagues, who are mostly baffled by her unusual behavior.

SCP-6802 remains an enigma to our organization, and further research is ongoing to understand the nature of her unique features and personality. However, it is clear that she is an asset to the force and an integral part of the urban fantasy world.
