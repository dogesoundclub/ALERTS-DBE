Item #: 9884

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 9884 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. While item 9884 has demonstrated no anomalous properties, it is to be monitored for any changes that may occur. All interactions with item 9884 must be conducted through a secure communication system to ensure safety.

Description: Item 9884, also known as "The Adventurer," appears to be a humanoid male species with orange stripes on their face and a frightened mouth. Their red clown eyes are known to cause discomfort to those who make eye contact with them. Item 9884's head appears to be a shade of green that does not occur in natural human skin tones.

Item 9884 is often seen wearing a red scarf and cigarette. It has been reported that they have a love for adventure and may enjoy taking risks or trying new things. This can lead to some humorous stories, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

Despite their love for adventure, item 9884 works as a lawyer in their everyday life. It is unclear how item 9884 obtained this profession or if they use their anomalous abilities in their practice. Further investigation is required.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, item 9884 was involved in an incident at a local amusement park. While participating in a rollercoaster ride, item 9884's anomalous abilities were activated, causing the rollercoaster to malfunction. Foundation agents were able to contain the situation without incident, and item 9884 has been relocated to Site-██ for closer monitoring. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of item 9884's abilities.
