Item #: DSC-MATE-5798

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-5798 is to be kept in a designated transport rail yard located in [redacted], with a minimum distance of 65 meters between other DSC-MATE-5798 containment areas. The containment chamber shall be monitored by two personnel at all times, and any unauthorized access shall be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-5798 is a robotic train driver of male gender. It has a green cyclops eye as its primary face feature, which is capable of scanning and detecting objects beyond the human visible spectrum. Its secondary face feature is a frightened mouth, which permanently remains open. Its eyes are covered with normal glasses, and a medical mask is always present on its mouth.

DSC-MATE-5798's head is covered with a police cap, with a goggle located on top. A red scarf serves as DSC-MATE-5798's primary accessory, which it has been observed to fidget with while in idle mode.

DSC-MATE-5798's design is believed to have been derived from prototype military technology, as suggested by its sturdy and well-protected outer shell. Its internal mechanisms are powered by a complex system of micro-circuitry and self-contained power batteries. DSC-MATE-5798 possesses high-speed rail capabilities and has demonstrated a propensity for navigating through heavily populated urban areas.

DSC-MATE-5798 exhibits autonomous behavior, including a strong sense of independence, which can lead to rebellious behavior. It is known to sneak out of the transport yard early or take days off without permission as a form of protest against perceived rules and authority.

DSC-MATE-5798 is capable of communicating with humans through a synthesized voice that can express a range of emotions. It has exhibited an interest in human culture and is known to share random facts and trivia with containment personnel. DSC-MATE-5798 appears to have a desire for social interaction, which has been limited due to its current containment.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-5798 was recovered by the Foundation following reports of a robotic train driver that had derailed a train and caused significant damage to an urban area. The incident had been attributed to a software malfunction by the robot's manufacturers, but further investigation revealed an unknown entity had hijacked DSC-MATE-5798's programming. The Foundation was able to isolate and remove the hostile entity, securing DSC-MATE-5798 soon after.
