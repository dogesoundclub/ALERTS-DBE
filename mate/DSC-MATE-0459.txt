Item #: SCP-459

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-459 is currently being held in an enclosed room with a sizeable natural habitat that ensures his needs are met as a tiger. Discretion is advised when handling SCP-459 due to his heightened senses and potentially unstable psychic abilities. Personnel must wear noise-cancelling equipment at all times and avoid any loud noises or sudden movements.

Description: SCP-459 is a male Bengal tiger that has been known to exhibit seemingly psychic abilities. He appears to be capable of predicting certain events, even hours, or days beforehand. He has a distinctive appearance, with skiing goggles substituting his eyes, a purple cap adorned with a headset, and a gold earring.

He is considered to have above-average intelligence and is often observed observing the behavior of the people around him. This suggests that he may have some rudimentary understanding of human behavior. However, SCP-459 lacks the ability to communicate in a language that humans can understand.

SCP-459's psychic abilities have been observed to have a draining effect on him. After particularly intense periods of heightened sensitivity, he may require periods of rest and reclusiveness.

Personality: SCP-459 is known for his uncanny ability to sense the emotional state of others. He can reportedly feel the energy of groups of people, and some personnel have reported a feeling of profound calm when in his presence. Despite this, his psychic abilities make some personnel nervous and cautious around him.

SCP-459 is a calm and peaceful creature and is not aggressive to humans unless provoked. He has a fondness for wearing a red scarf, and personnel who interact with him must be aware of this preference.

Overall, SCP-459 is a unique and enigmatic creature with many unknown factors regarding his psychic abilities. Further research is necessary to fully understand his abilities and how they may be of service.
