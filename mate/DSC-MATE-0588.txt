Subject 588, also known as "The News Anchor", is a female human with striking VR Jade LED eyes and a welcoming smile. She has blonde hair often found tucked inside a Ushanka hat and is usually seen sporting a Red Cross earring. One of her frequent accessories is a cigarette that she often uses as a prop to punctuate a point.
 
While her charming personality makes her well-loved by many, it should be noted that she can be a bit of a scatterbrain at times. Despite her rigorous training and journalistic qualifications, she has been known to forget appointments or get sidetracked, leading to some hilarious situations. In some cases, she's been known to wander into unknown territories and lose her way while trying to reach a new destination.
 
Subjects interacting with Subject 588 should be aware of her absent-minded tendencies and take precautionary measures where needed. However, when focused and on-task, The News Anchor is a reliable source for breaking news and insight into the supernatural world.
