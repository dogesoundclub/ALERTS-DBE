SCP-7318, codenamed "The Don," is a male human of indeterminate age and ethnicity. He stands at 6'2" and has a stocky build, indicative of the power he holds as the head of a prominent mafia family. The most striking feature of his face is a dark spot located at the corner of his mouth, reminiscent of a smudge of ink. Despite the ominous nature of this marking, SCP-7318's expression is often jovial, characterized by a wide, toothy smile that never seems to reach his eyes.

Speaking of his eyes, SCP-7318's are notable for their unusual appearance. They resemble a pair of ski goggles, with lenses that are sleek and reflective. This feature can make it difficult for outsiders to read his true intentions or emotions, although some have reported feeling intensely uncomfortable beneath his gaze.

SCP-7318's head is kept warm by a red beanie, which he often pulls low over his ears to further obscure his face. Speaking of his ears, he wears a single jade earring in his left one, an enigmatic symbol whose significance is unknown.

One of SCP-7318's most prominent accessories is a thick silver chain, which he wears around his neck at all times. It appears to hold special significance for him, although no information regarding its origin or purpose has been uncovered.

Although known primarily for his ruthless tactics as a Mafia boss, SCP-7318's personality contains a surprising detail-oriented streak. He is known to meticulously organize his possessions and surroundings, going to extreme lengths to ensure that everything is just so. Some may view this as a harmless quirk, but SCP-7318's particular brand of obsessiveness suggests that there may be darker implications lurking beneath the surface. It is recommended that all personnel exercise caution around SCP-7318 and treat him with the utmost respect and deference.
