Special Containment Procedures: Subject 7133 is to be contained within a standard living quarters, outfitted with basic amenities. Access to the subject is to be granted only with permission from the assigned handler, and all personnel interacting with the subject must undergo a thorough psychological evaluation.

Description: Subject 7133 is a male humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, who presents with distinctive orange stripes on the face, as well as a smile that is virtually ever-present. The subject also appears to take particular pride in his wardrobe, typically wearing a short peak cap, nerd glasses, and a red scarf, which complements his two-color band forehead feature and gold earring.

Perhaps most notable is the subject’s apparent fascination with technology, which is evidenced by the fact that he is often seen wearing an LED gas mask. His natural inclination for outlandish ideas and creative brainstorming sessions can often lead to humor, which the subject seems to revel in.

Addendum: Subject 7133’s skills as a trained veterinarian have been put to use in several containment situations, and while he clearly harbors an intense respect for living things, there is a sense that he is perhaps more interested in their biological functions than most individuals. Nonetheless, he has demonstrated an admirable level of professionalism in all his interactions with the creatures that he has tended to, and his skillset has proved remarkably valuable to Foundation personnel.
