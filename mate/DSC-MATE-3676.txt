Item #: SCP-3676

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3676 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. The subject is allowed limited social interactions with other personnel and can perform duties as a traffic officer within the designated area. The use of a gas mask is recommended when interacting with SCP-3676 to avoid any potential memetic effects.

Description: SCP-3676 is a human male with blue clown eyes, green hair in a purple cap, and a smile that seems to be permanently affixed to his face. The subject has a gold earring in each ear and wears a gold chain around his neck. SCP-3676's forehead bears a two-color band that appears to have been painted on with makeup.

SCP-3676 displays an extremely outgoing and social personality, often seeking attention and enjoying being the center of attention. They are prone to telling jokes or stories that can quickly spread laughter across a group, but some individuals who listen to SCP-3676's tales often report feeling a bit overwhelmed by the experience.

The subject has been appointed as a traffic officer within the containment area and performs their duties efficiently. SCP-3676 tends to interact with drivers and pedestrians with humor and enthusiasm, encouraging them to follow traffic rules and regulations in a friendly and engaging manner.

Addendum: Due to SCP-3676's outgoing nature, some Foundation personnel have reported mild signs of discomfort in their presence, leading to the recommendation of wearing a gas mask as a precautionary measure. However, SCP-3676 has not exhibited any memetic effects to date. Researchers are advised to monitor all interactions with the subject carefully.
