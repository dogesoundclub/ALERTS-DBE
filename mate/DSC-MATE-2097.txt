Item #: 2097

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: 2097 is currently contained at Site-██ in a standard human containment chamber with access to basic amenities. 2097 is not to be allowed access to mechanical implements unless deemed necessary by Level 2 personnel. Any unusual behavior from 2097 is to be reported to Site personnel immediately.

Description: 2097 is a male human identified as a mechanic with a peculiar Mouth Spot on his face that appears somewhat random in shape and placement. When startled or frightened, 2097's mouth contorts into an extreme and somewhat frightening expression. 2097's eyes are typically obscured by Normal Glasses, and they wear a Gold Chain and often hold a lit Cigarette in their mouth.

2097 has demonstrated a deep curiosity about the world around them, often delving into obscure and unusual topics. They have been known to randomly spout obscure facts and trivia to others, resulting in occasional humorous situations. 2097's occasional enthusiastic nature can be a bit overwhelming to those around them, and caution should be taken not to trigger their fear response.

Addendum: In Incident Report 2097-A, it is noted that 2097 demonstrated an unnatural understanding and aptitude for mechanical objects, resulting in a containment breach. Further study into this potential ability is to be conducted by Site personnel.
