SCP File# 143: "The Banker"

Description: SCP-143 appears as an average-looking female human with a friendly smile, orange eyebrows, and medical mask covering her mouth. She is often seen wearing a choker, which is believed to be a personal choice rather than an anomalous effect. Despite her mundane appearance, SCP-143 possesses a unique ability to sense the emotions of those around her and empathize with them on an intense level.

Personality: SCP-143 is a highly empathetic individual with a penchant for bringing positivity into the lives of those she interacts with. Her ability to sense the emotions of others is uncanny, and she uses this skill to improve the lives of those around her. SCP-143 has a boundless amount of energy and is always ready with a joke or a story to lift the spirits of those who are feeling down. Her presence is known to brighten up even the darkest of situations.

Containment: SCP-143 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, which is to be furnished with personal items of her own choosing. She has been granted access to a limited amount of books, music, and art supplies to keep her entertained. Due to her unique abilities, SCP-143 is to be monitored closely and isolated from normal humans to prevent the risk of her abilities being discovered and exploited.

Interaction: All interactions with SCP-143 are to be conducted with strict adherence to protocol. Personnel are to wear face masks to avoid exposing SCP-143 to any illnesses that may interfere with her empathic abilities. SCP-143's positive attitude is contagious, but researchers are advised to remain professional at all times.

Notes: SCP-143 is a valuable asset to the Foundation, and her abilities are currently being studied for their potential uses in interrogation and intelligence gathering. Until further notice, she is to remain in containment and used only with the approval of the O5 council.
