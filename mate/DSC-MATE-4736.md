Item #: 4736

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4736 is to be monitored at all times while in public spaces, and any civilians who come into contact with subject 4736 are to be administered a Class B amnestic immediately afterwards. Any attempts by subject 4736 to utilize their anomalous abilities to control the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic are to be immediately halted by on-site security personnel.

Description: Subject 4736 is a human female with bright orange stripes extending down either side of their face. Their ears are adorned with a red cross earring and they wear a pink rabbit headpiece. The subject is also seen wearing a medical mask and a black choker around their neck. When asked, subject 4736 claims to be a traffic officer, but there is no record of them being employed by any law enforcement agency or city council.

Subject 4736 is believed to possess a limited form of mind control, which they can use to influence the behavior of pedestrians and drivers in their proximity. This seems to only function when they are wearing their full costume and has been shown to be ineffective against individuals with strong enough wills or those wearing sound-blocking headphones. In addition, subject 4736 also displays a tendency towards forgetfulness and absent-mindedness, which can sometimes lead to amusing situations.

Addendum: After initial observation, it has been noted that there might exist the possibility that our subject might have slipped into this reality from a parallel universe. Further research is highly recommended.
