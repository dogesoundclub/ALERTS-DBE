Item #: SCP-2154

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2154 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Access to the chamber must be granted only by Level 3 personnel or higher. Any food provided must be cooked and prepared in a manner that is suitable for consumption by a tiger. No smoking is allowed within SCP-2154's containment chamber or in any other area in the facility.

Description: SCP-2154 is a male, anthropomorphic tiger with glasses that give the appearance of a "nerd". SCP-2154's appearance is distinctive by its frightened mouth and the red victory band placed on its forehead. SCP-2154 wears a hoodie, a red scarf, and is often seen smoking a cigarette. SCP-2154 is employed as a programmer and has extensive knowledge of computer programming languages.

SCP-2154 displays a strong sense of empathy and is particularly attuned to the emotions of others. SCP-2154 has been known to humorously help others find joy in difficult situations, employ the perfect words to soothe people's minds, and diffuse tensions. However, SCP-2154 struggles with its own emotions and often finds it challenging to manage them.

Addendum 2154-A: On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred due to the neglect of the smoking prohibition within SCP-2154's chamber. SCP-2154 suffered heavy burns and facial injuries as a result of the fire that ensued. Treatment involved skin grafting and reconstructive surgery, and SCP-2154 is expected to make a full recovery. As a result, smoking is strictly prohibited near SCP-2154's chamber.
