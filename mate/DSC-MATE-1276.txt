Item #: SCP-1276

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1276 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with all amenities required for daily living. Any attempts for unauthorized communication with SCP-1276 are to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1276 is a humanoid entity appearing to be a male human of approximately 30 years old. It stands at 6 feet tall, with lean muscle mass and orange stripes on its face. Its eyes are concealed by normal glasses, and its head is usually covered by a hoodie. SCP-1276 also possesses a 2 color band on its forehead, which seems to emit a dim light when under stress.

SCP-1276 commonly accessorizes itself with a red scarf and a cigarette, which it claims helps to calm its nerves. Its behavior often includes a dry sense of humor, which can catch people off guard with its deadpan and surprisingly funny delivery. However, caution is advised when interacting with SCP-1276 as it has shown a tendency to manipulate its surroundings to obtain its own objectives.

SCP-1276 was discovered working as a banker in a large corporation in downtown [REDACTED]. Its role in the corporation was to oversee and approve financial transactions worth millions of dollars, which it often did with ease. Its exceptional financial abilities and cold calculative personality led to suspicions from its colleagues, and it was eventually apprehended by the Foundation and contained.

Addendum: During an interview, SCP-1276 stated that it was aware of the supernatural world and that it would like to assist the Foundation in its efforts to contain other anomalies. Ongoing negotiations for its involvement in the organization's activities are currently being conducted.
