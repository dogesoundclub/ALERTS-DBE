Description: Item 4661 is a human male, identified as a train driver in his previous occupation. The subject stands at approximately 5'9" and weighs roughly 160 pounds.

Interactions with the subject have demonstrated that he is an excellent gift-giver, gifted with the ability to deduce what people want, and can bring joy and happiness to people with a single gift.
