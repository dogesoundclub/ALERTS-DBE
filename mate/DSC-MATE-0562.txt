Item #: 562

Object Class: Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 562, codenamed "Tigris," is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Tigris has been outfitted with a medical mask to prevent its anomalous properties from affecting nearby personnel. Under no circumstances are any untrained personnel to make contact with Tigris without proper protection.

Description: Tigris appears to be a male tiger species with distinctive ski goggle eyes and a purple cap with a headset. Tigris's forehead also features a goggle, while its ears have a red cross earring.

Tigris's personality is highly introspective with a propensity for daydreaming and often losing itself in thought. This can lead to some amusing situations where the subject accidentally walks into objects or trips over obstacles.

Tigris's anomalous properties are related to its introspective nature. When overstimulated, Tigris can enter a type of trance-like state, projecting its thoughts into reality. The effects of this state can vary from mild hallucinations to potent reality-warping events.

Addendum: After a recent incident where Tigris's anomalous abilities were triggered, it was discovered that the subject works as a programmer outside of Foundation containment. Although no direct link has been established, further investigation is underway to determine how this profession may play into Tigris's anomalous abilities.
