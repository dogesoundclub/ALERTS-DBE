ITEM #: SCP-3163

OBJECT CLASS: Euclid

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: SCP-3163 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. All personnel are required to wear gas masks when in the presence of SCP-3163 due to its LED gas mask. SCP-3163 is not allowed to interact with any non-Foundation personnel.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-3163 is a male monkey, identifiable by the purple cap and gold earring it wears. It is typically found dressed in business attire, specifically a suit and tie. SCP-3163 claims to be a real estate agent, but it is unsure if this is true or simply a persona adopted by the creature.

SCP-3163 is highly intelligent and tends to approach situations in a logical and analytical manner. It is known to enjoy debating and arguing with others, even over seemingly trivial topics. This personality trait can cause humorous situations, but it should also be noted that SCP-3163 can become aggressive during debates.

SCP-3163's most notable feature is its LED gas mask. The mask emits a pulsating light that changes colors depending on SCP-3163's emotional state or level of agitation. During periods of intense debate or anger, the light can become blinding and cause disorientation in those nearby.

SCP-3163's origins and purpose are unknown. It was discovered living in a residential area by Foundation agents and was subsequently contained.

ADDENDUM 3163-1: SCP-3163 has recently begun displaying unusual abilities related to the buying and selling of property. It is unclear if these abilities are related to its claims of being a real estate agent. Further observation is suggested.
