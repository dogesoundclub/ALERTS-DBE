Its bodily composition is primarily metallic, with notable features including a large green cyclops eye and a pair of goggles situated on its forehead. DSC-MATE-299 also possesses a normal gas mask accessory, presumably used for filtration purposes. 

Despite its mechanical nature, DSC-MATE-299 presents with human-like mannerisms and an introspective personality. It is common for the robot to become lost in thought, resulting in humorous blunders and accidents. However, under certain circumstances, DSC-MATE-299 exhibits a commanding and confident demeanor, suggestive of a natural-born leader.

Due to its mysterious origin and uncertain purpose, DSC-MATE-299 is considered an anomaly in the urban fantasy genre.
