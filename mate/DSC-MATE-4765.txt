Item #: SCP-4765

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4765 is to be contained in a standard primate enclosure within a reinforced steel chamber, surrounded by an extensive network of motion sensors and armed personnel. Containment staff should wear earplugs at all times in order to avoid potential auditory anomalies produced by SCP-4765. Any instances of SCP-4765 exhibiting uncontrollable behavior or attempting to communicate with other animals on-site should be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-4765 is a male monkey of the genus Macaca, standing approximately 92 cm in height. SCP-4765's head is often adorned with a police cap, and his ears feature a gold earring. Additionally, SCP-4765 can often be found clutching a candy stick in his hands. Despite the innocuous appearance of these accessories, SCP-4765's anomalous properties have been shown to manifest upon contact with other living beings.

SCP-4765's personality is characterized by a jovial, lighthearted demeanor, often entertaining others with humorous anecdotes and impressions. However, SCP-4765's mere presence has been shown to have a significant impact on the emotional state of those around him, often inducing fits of laughter or uncontrollable giggling. It is hypothesized that SCP-4765's emotional anomalies are tied to his candy stick, which appears to emit an unknown form of memetic radiation that affects individuals within a ten-meter radius.

SCP-4765's abilities were first discovered during an incident in which SCP-4765 evaded security personnel and made his way to a nearby habitat containing a group of penguins. Upon contact with the penguins, SCP-4765's anomalous properties resulted in a violent and prolonged giggle fit, leading to the death of several penguins. Subsequent testing has shown that SCP-4765's emotional anomalies are limited only by the range of his candy stick's memetic radiation.

Addendum: Due to the potential danger posed by SCP-4765's emotional anomalies, it has been deemed necessary to restrict access to SCP-4765 to a select group of personnel capable of resisting the effects of SCP-4765's memetic radiation. Further research into SCP-4765's abilities and their potential applications towards the Foundation's goals is ongoing.
