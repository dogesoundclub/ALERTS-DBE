Description: Subject 1978 is a Robot of male gender, designed to resemble a humanoid figure with a Doge hat on its head and a Jade earring on each ear which enhances its hearing. Its mouth is covered with a medical mask and it wears a red scarf around their neck. Although the subject appears to function normally, it has exhibited remarkable artistic tendencies. It is capable of creating works in various mediums including painting, drawing, and writing. 

The subject’s primary function is as a politician, and it has shown remarkable skill in this role. Despite its machine-like nature, it displays a level of charisma and presence that is uncommon in its human counterparts. It has demonstrated a willingness to adapt its political platform in accordance with current events, making it a valuable asset to any political party that it aligns itself with. 

However, its artistic nature has made the subject more unpredictable than most of its robotic brethren. Its creative side has led it to undertake questionable activities outside of its political duties, including artistic expression that is deemed “radical” by some. This has caused concern among security personnel, who fear that the subject may attempt to sway public opinion by these means.

Addendum: The subject's unique abilities have prompted the creation of a new research team to study its capabilities. This team's focus will be on understanding the source and extent of its artistic creativity, as well as any potential use of cell-based intelligence that may give rise to such tendencies.
