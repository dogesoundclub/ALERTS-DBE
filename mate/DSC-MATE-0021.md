Item #: 21

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 21 is to be integrated into human society with no additional containment measures necessary. However, subject's accessories must be checked routinely for any anomalies that may have adverse effects on its surrounding environment.

Description: Subject 21, also known as the Traffic Officer, is a human female, possibly of Asian descent, standing at 5'4" and weighing around 120 lbs. Its most notable feature is its head covered with a hoodie, which is black in color and obscures most of its face. The subject often wears a silver chain around its neck and carries a normal gas mask as an accessory.

Subject 21 exhibits an introverted personality and may spend a significant amount of time daydreaming or lost in thought. This behavior has led to some humorous situations where the subject has accidentally stumbled onto a nearby object or tripped over something while lost in thought.

Based on initial psychological evaluations, it appears that Subject 21 is aware of its surroundings but prefers to remain distant from observed social interactions. Its introverted nature has caused some concern for its ability to properly integrate into human society.

Addendum: Exploration into Subject 21's past history remains ongoing.

Note: Any individuals who may come into contact with Subject 21 should not attempt to engage in prolonged interactions as it may provoke an adverse reaction.
