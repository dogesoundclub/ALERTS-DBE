Item #: SCP-5435

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5435 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to its unpredictable nature, no less than two armed guards must be present during any interaction with SCP-5435. SCP-5435 must be provided with cigarettes and other smoking accessories upon request. Any unapproved projects or activities proposed by SCP-5435 must be evaluated by Level 4 personnel before approval.

Description: SCP-5435 appears to be a male tiger in its late twenties, which has gained the ability to take on human form. SCP-5435 is often found wearing a purple cap with a headset, a red cross earring, a gold chain and red clown noses framing its eyes. The tiger’s human-like face is seen to show a constant state of fear with a frightened mouth.

SCP-5435 is fluent in multiple human languages and works as a lawyer. SCP-5435 tends to favor adventurous activities and taking risks. Reports indicate that SCP-5435 has experienced near-death situations while bungee jumping and inadvertently getting lost in isolated areas. This trait may pose a significant breach of containment risk due to its disregard for safety protocols.

Addendum: SCP-5435 has proven resistant to most sedatives and drugs administered to control behavior but has been known to comply if treated respectfully. SCP-5435 has requested a small TV, cigarettes and occasional solo trips to the wilderness as requisites for cooperation. Clearance can be granted on a case-by-case basis.

SCP-5435 has provided the Foundation with crucial information in numerous cases, particularly in cross-species legal issues. Researchers suggest regular mental evaluations may help understand SCP-5435’s unique mind and assist in maximizing its utility as a Foundation asset.
