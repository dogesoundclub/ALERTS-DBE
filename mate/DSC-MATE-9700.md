Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9700 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The LED gas mask is to be kept in a separate storage locker unless approved for use during experimental testing. Interaction with DSC-MATE-9700 is to be limited to approved research and testing only. All communication with DSC-MATE-9700 must be recorded and reviewed by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: DSC-MATE-9700 is a female human identified as a computer programmer named ███████ ████████. DSC-MATE-9700's appearance is striking, with orange stripes on their face and red lips. Their eyes are that of a clown, with bright blue irises, and they often have their hair styled in a rainbow fashion. They wear a gold earring in their left ear at all times. Notably, DSC-MATE-9700 wears an LED gas mask, which obscures their facial features, during most periods of containment.

DSC-MATE-9700 exhibits an extraordinarily strong sense of empathy, allowing them to infer the emotional states of those around them. They are also capable of reading the emotional state of a room or area without directly interacting with others. DSC-MATE-9700 is known to utilize humor and witty banter to lighten the mood of those around them, often to great effect.

Despite their jovial demeanor, DSC-MATE-9700 has been known to display significant mental strain during periods of extreme emotional distress. It is unknown whether this is a result of their empathic abilities or an unrelated condition. DSC-MATE-9700 has never shown any signs of hostility or ill intent towards Foundation personnel, and has been cooperative during all interactions with containment staff.

DSC-MATE-9700 was discovered during routine monitoring of social media activity related to anomalous occurrences. They were flagged for inquiring about local ley line concentrations and their potential effects on technological infrastructure. DSC-MATE-9700 was interviewed by Foundation agents under the guise of a standard employment opportunity, and subsequently contained after the manifestation of anomalous empathic activity was confirmed.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9700 has requested access to books, films, and other materials related to inspirational humor and motivational speaking. This has been approved by Level 3 personnel, pending review of all materials prior to distribution.
