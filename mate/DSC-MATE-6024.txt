Interview Log:

Dr. ██████: How did you acquire your love for adventure and risk-taking?

SCP-6024: I don't know, doc. I guess I was just born this way. Some people are content with living normal lives, but not me. I need excitement. I need danger.

Dr. ██████: Your actions have caused harm to innocent people. Can you justify that?

SCP-6024: Hey, they knew the risks when they got involved. Besides, sometimes you need casualties in order to make real change.

Dr. ██████: And what real change are you referring to?

SCP-6024: (laughs) Oh come on, doc. You know what I'm talking about. The system is broken, and somebody's gotta fix it. And if that means breaking a few eggs along the way, so be it.

Note: Following the interview, SCP-6024 attempted to escape and had to be restrained by security personnel. It is recommended that he be placed under stricter containment measures.
