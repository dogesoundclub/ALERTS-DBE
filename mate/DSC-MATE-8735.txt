SCP Foundation Containment Report: 8735

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-8735 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Communication with SCP-8735 is to be limited to scheduled interviews with at least two Level 3 personnel. All interactions must be conducted through a secure communication system, with the use of a medical-grade mask for verbal communication. SCP-8735 is to be provided with a canvas, a set of paintbrushes, and acrylic paint for hobby activities.

Description:
SCP-8735 appears to be a human male in his late 30s, standing at 6'2" with a weight of 196lbs. SCP-8735 wears a red scarf and a medical mask, which covers the mouth spot on his face. SCP-8735's face features are unique, with a frightening mouth being the most prominent feature. SCP-8735's head appears to have multiple layers of green color, and he has a jade earring on each ear. SCP-8735 is the manager of an urban theater, which serves as his primary source of income.

Personality:
SCP-8735's personality is distinct, as he seems to possess a creative and artistic side that he expresses through various hobbies and interests. SCP-8735 enjoys painting, drawing, and writing, showcasing artistic talent and inspiring a sense of awe in observers. SCP-8735 is a socially acute individual and has excellent communication skills. He engages in conversations with remarkable ease, but apparently, SCP-8735 has grown wary of the world and finds solace in his artistic abilities.

Addendum:
SCP-8735 was discovered in a suburb of [REDACTED], where he was initially detained for causing a commotion. The subject displayed supernatural abilities that allowed him to manipulate sounds and feed off the emotional state of sentient creatures. Upon realizing the subject's potential, the SCP Foundation contained him as he became a danger to himself and others. SCP-8735's artistic abilities have been deemed useful by the Foundation, and access to painting supplies has been granted to the subject. Despite SCP-8735's odd appearance, the subject rarely poses a threat to on-site staff, and all interactions with the subject have been pleasant so far.
