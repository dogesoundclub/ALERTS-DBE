Item #: SCP-6267

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6267 is to be kept in a secure, soundproof containment cell at all times. Any interaction with SCP-6267 must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Due to SCP-6267's high level of influence in the criminal underworld, Foundation agents are to monitor all criminal activity related to SCP-6267 for potential anomalies or breaches of security.

Description: SCP-6267 is a human male of unknown age and origin. Despite appearing fully organic, SCP-6267 seems to possess cybernetic enhancements, which include a metal purple head, gold earring-shaped ears, VR jade LED eyes, and a mouth spot. SCP-6267 prefers to accessorize with a silver chain and candy stick.

SCP-6267's personality is characterized by a reckless and impulsive nature. SCP-6267 appears to act before thinking through situations, causing humorous mishaps or minor accidents in an attempt to impress others. Due to SCP-6267's connection to the mafia, it is advised to approach SCP-6267 with caution and to not engage in any risky or precarious behavior.

Addendum: SCP-6267's position as head of the mafia is of great interest to the Foundation, and ongoing research is being conducted to understand the extent of SCP-6267's influence and power. It is unknown if the cybernetic enhancements were self-induced or a result of an unknown experiment, but strong measures must be taken to prevent any other members of the mafia from obtaining similar enhancements.
