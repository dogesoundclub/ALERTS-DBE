Item #: SCP-7427

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7427 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. Due to their affiliations with the criminal underworld, no physical contact or interaction with SCP-7427 is allowed unless approved by at least two Level 4 personnel. Any unauthorized individuals found to have interacted with SCP-7427 are to be immediately detained and questioned by Foundation personnel. 

Description: SCP-7427 is a human female with striking features. They have orange stripes on their face, a purple lip, and their eyes emit a VR rainbow LED effect at all times. SCP-7427 always wears a hoodie and a silver chain accessory. 

SCP-7427 is the current leader of a notorious mafia family known as "The Syndicate". SCP-7427's ability to solve problems quickly and effectively, regardless of the means used, has given them a reputation as a prodigious and feared boss. Despite their involvement in organized crime, SCP-7427 appears to have a pragmatic approach to life, opting to approach problems head-on rather than be consumed by endless speculation. 

It is evident from SCP-7427's past operations that they hold immense influence over their subordinates, mainly due to their uncompromising attitude towards their enemies. Despite this, SCP-7427 is known to be fiercely protective of their inner circle of family members and is willing to go to great lengths to keep them safe, even if it contradicts their usual approach to situations. 

SCP-7427's abilities, while concerning, have yet to breach Foundation security, and they have not been implicated in any uncontainable incidents. It is advised, however, that SCP-7427 is kept under close surveillance for any unusual behavior. 

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, an attempt to breach SCP-7427's containment was made, resulting in a firefight with Foundation personnel. SCP-7427's whereabouts are currently unknown, and an in-depth investigation is underway to determine their current location and intentions. Any further encounters with SCP-7427 should be reported immediately.
