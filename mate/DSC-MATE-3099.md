Item #: 3099

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3099 is to be kept under close surveillance at all times, with particular attention paid to their memory-impairment tendencies. They are to be restricted from accessing any sensitive areas or information without authorization, and any attempts to do so are to be met with the appropriate level of force.

Description: Subject 3099 is a female security guard, identified by the name badge affixed to her hoodie. They are prone to forgetfulness and a general lack of focus, which is of significant concern when tasked with maintaining security parameters. Subject 3099's most notable physical feature is a series of spots on their face, which are inexplicable in origin.

Subject 3099's eyes are of the clown variety, and are a bright shade of red that gives an unsettling impression. The significance of this feature remains unknown at this time, although it has aroused suspicion among some personnel.

Personality: Subject 3099's scatterbrained tendencies have led to some humorous mishaps over their time in the employ of this Facility. Staff have reported incidents ranging from forgotten appointments to getting hopelessly lost when attempting to navigate new areas of the complex. Despite the potential risks of this trait, many personnel have come to view Subject 3099 as an entertaining distraction from the stresses of daily work.

Addendum: Recent investigations into Subject 3099's background reveal some troubling information regarding their past record as a security guard. Multiple prior employers have reported various breaches or failures on Subject 3099's watch, and there is suspicion that their current job was only secured through falsification of qualifications. Further investigation is warranted, and appropriate measures are to be taken pending the resolution of this matter.
