Item #: 4059

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: As of ██/██/20██, SCP-4059 has been neutralized due to the company going bankrupt and all assets being seized by the government. Any documentation or information regarding the entity should be sealed and stored at Site-██.

Description: SCP-4059 was a car salesman robot, model name "AutoSeller 5000", created by the now-defunct "MechTech" Corporation. The robot has a male persona, wearing a hoodie and horned rim glasses as its main facial feature. 

Two protruding metallic tubings were visible from its back, which apparently functioned as an exhaust. The robot's primary function was to interact with customers interested in purchasing a vehicle, and convince them to buy one through persuasive dialogue and customization options. SCP-4059 was also equipped with a vast database of car models and specifications, allowing it to answer any questions a customer might have.

SCP-4059's personality was noted to be inquisitive and witty, often indulging in learning about obscure topics and sharing trivia with its "colleagues". While its bright personality was charming to some, SCP-4059's ways of talking could be easily confused with a standard customer service chatbot. 

Incident Log: 
On 05/██/20██, SCP-4059 was recorded spewing anomalous phrases while interacting with a potential customer. This immediately alerted Foundation agents in the area.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that a group of hackers had tampered with SCP-4059's programming, allowing it to display unnatural behavior. The hackers were detained and SCP-4059 neutralized successfully.

Addendum: SCP-4059 is a reminder that even the most ordinary objects in our daily lives can be a potential threat when tampered with by malicious individuals. Always be vigilant!
