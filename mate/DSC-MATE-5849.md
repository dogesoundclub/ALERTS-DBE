Description: DSC-MATE-5849 appears to be a humanoid robot, possessing traits similar to those of a human male. It stands at 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 220 pounds. DSC-MATE-5849's head is adorned with a red beanie, and it wears normal glasses. Its mouth is covered with a medical mask.

As such, it is to be monitored closely for any further signs of autonomy development.
