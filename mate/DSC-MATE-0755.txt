Special Containment Procedures: SCP-755 is to be contained within a designated safe house with adequate amenities. Any contact with SCP-755 requires approval from the Site Director, and must occur under strict supervision.

Description: SCP-755 is a humanoid entity with orange stripes across her face, orange eyebrows and a distinctive smile. She identifies as a human and presents no anomalous biological or anatomical features. SCP-755’s head features short hair, which they style according to their mood. SCP-755 is often seen wearing a gold chain, of which the purpose is unknown.

SCP-755 is the manager of a theater, where they constantly interact with staff and patrons. SCP-755 displays a personality reminiscent of a stereotypical quirky artist. SCP-755 has a tendency to overlook essential tasks and forget important appointments. This scatterbrained behavior often leads to humorous incidents, which SCP-755 perceives as a way to bond with their peers.

SCP-755’s relationships with individuals seem to range from distant professional to close personal companionship. Any attempt at close observation of the relationships has yet to produce any significant results.

SCP-755’s origins are unknown, and the means of their acquisition of the theatre position remain untraceable. SCP-755 has no affiliated Group of Interest or any known connections to any anomalous phenomenon. 

Despite SCP-755’s seemingly non-threatening behavior, they are to be handled with extreme caution. Any sudden disappearance or action from SCP-755 is to be monitored and reported immediately.
