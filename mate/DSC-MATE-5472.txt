Item #: 5472

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5472, also known by the local population as "The Tiger Driver", is to be kept under surveillance in order to ensure that his activities do not infringe upon the veil of secrecy surrounding the supernatural world. Any sightings of SCP-5472 outside of the designated safe zones are to be reported to the Foundation immediately.

Description: SCP-5472 is a Tiger male of unknown age, wearing a Doge hat and a Jade earring attached to each ear. His eyes resemble those of a clown, a deep red color that is highly unusual for creatures of his kind. He is often seen sporting a silver chain, which is believed to be a good luck charm of some sort.

SCP-5472 is known to work as a Delivery Driver in the urban environment, using his extensive knowledge of the city's hidden places to navigate through the complex road network with incredible ease. Despite his laid-back and easy-going demeanor, SCP-5472 is fiercely loyal and will go to any lengths to protect his loved ones. Witnesses have reported him engaging in heated arguments with anyone who insults his friends or family members, often resulting in humorous situations due to the sheer absurdity of a talking Tiger to the uninitiated.

Despite his magical abilities, SCP-5472 has been cooperative with the Foundation and has posed no immediate threat to human life. SCP-5472 remains under full surveillance and will be monitored for any signs of deviation from its usual activity.

Addendum: SCP-5472 has been known to occasionally engage in activities with other supernatural entities in the city, such as the local fae community or the local vampire coven. While SCP-5472's intentions are unknown, it should be viewed as a potential risk to the Foundation's mandate of secrecy. Investigations are ongoing.
