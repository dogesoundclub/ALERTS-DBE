Item #: SCP-6417
Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6417 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. As SCP-6417 is a police officer for the local law enforcement, it is to be allowed to continue its duties within the force under Foundation surveillance. All encounters with SCP-6417 must be recorded and monitored for any unusual activity or behavior.

Description: SCP-6417 is a male monkey with a frightened mouth and eyes covered by nerd glasses. It wears a purple cap with a headset, along with a red scarf around its neck. Its forehead features a two-color band and a goggle on the forehead. Despite its anomalous appearance, SCP-6417 is capable of speaking fluently in multiple languages, which has been attributed to the anomalous nature of its species.

SCP-6417 exhibits a personality that is generally analytical and logical. It enjoys debating and arguing with others, often to alleviate boredom. SCP-6417 has been involved in several humorous situations, including heated debates on trivial or unimportant subjects, causing disruptions among its peers.

SCP-6417 maintains a career as a local police officer, where its analytical and logical abilities make it an asset in solving crimes. However, it has been observed to take unnecessary risks and exceed the boundaries of its authority when pursuing criminal activity.

Addendum 6417-1: During city-wide riots in ██, SCP-6417 showed an increased willingness to use excessive force, despite orders to the contrary. Investigation into the cause of this behavior is ongoing.
