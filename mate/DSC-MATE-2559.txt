SCP Identification Number: SCP-2559

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2559 is to be monitored via local news broadcasts for any anomalous activity. If SCP-2559's personality displays signs of deviation from normal human behavior, Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") is to be dispatched immediately.

Description: SCP-2559 is a human male identified as a news anchor for a local television station. SCP-2559's face features orange stripes and their head has green layers. SCP-2559 is commonly seen wearing normal glasses and a silver chain as an accessory. Despite its unusual physical traits, SCP-2559's presence has gone unnoticed by the general public.

SCP-2559 displays an unusual personality, valuing harmony and social connections, while also maintaining a goofy side. This has led to SCP-2559 engaging in playful banter and telling jokes during live news broadcasts. SCP-2559's anomalous behavior extends to its ability to attract and influence viewers, resulting in highly favorable ratings for the station.

SCP-2559's anomalous abilities are not fully understood, but it is clear that its presence has the potential to disrupt social order. SCP-2559 must be monitored and contained to prevent widespread influence or manipulation of the populace. While SCP-2559 has not demonstrated any hostile intentions or aggression, it remains a significant threat to normalcy.

Addendum: Incident 2559-A: On ██/██/20██, SCP-2559 demonstrated an abnormal shift in behavior during a live broadcast. SCP-2559's physical features became distorted, and its speech became erratic and incomprehensible. Foundation personnel were dispatched to the news station, and a cover story was disseminated to the public. SCP-2559 was contained and moved to Site ██ for further observation and study.
