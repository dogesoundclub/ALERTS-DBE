Item #: SCP-7590

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7590 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Access to SCP-7590 is to be granted only with Level 2 clearance, and all personnel interacting with SCP-7590 must be monitored at all times. Any attempts at humor or levity are to be strictly forbidden in SCP-7590's presence. SCP-7590 is granted one cigarette per day as a privilege, but all lighters and matches are to be strictly prohibited.

Description: SCP-7590 is a humanoid entity resembling a female in her mid-thirties. SCP-7590 exhibits features commonly associated with the style popular in the early 2000s, including a red lip and a two-color band on her forehead. SCP-7590's most notable feature is her orange eyebrows, which appear to glow in low light conditions. SCP-7590 is often seen wearing a green cross earring and a silver chain, and is frequently observed smoking a cigarette.

SCP-7590's personality is generally friendly and humorous, often telling jokes or engaging in witty banter. However, SCP-7590's jokes have been observed to be significantly darker in nature than those of most other individuals. SCP-7590 has been known to make light of tragic events, to the point of causing emotional distress in those around her. SCP-7590's humor is tempered by a sense of melancholy, and she has been observed to have difficulty experiencing joy or happiness outside of making others laugh.

SCP-7590's anomalous properties manifest when individuals interact with her on a social level, causing them to gradually become more depressed and anxious over time. This effect is most pronounced in individuals who spend extended periods of time in SCP-7590's presence, with the effects increasing in severity the longer the exposure. SCP-7590's effect on an individual's mental state is not affected by whether or not they find her humor enjoyable.

Addendum 7590-1: Following Incident 7590-██, all personnel interacting with SCP-7590 must be decontaminated following exposure to SCP-7590. SCP-7590 is to be dosed with Class-C amnestics following all interactions with personnel, in order to prevent potential long-term effects on mental health.

Addendum 7590-2: As of ██/██/20██, SCP-7590 will be relocated to a more secure containment chamber following [REDACTED]. Requests for testing on SCP-7590's anomalous properties must be approved by at least 2 Level 3 personnel, and all testing must be conducted in a controlled environment with appropriate measures in place to contain SCP-7590's anomalous effects.
