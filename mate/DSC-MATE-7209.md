Identification Number: DSC-MATE-7209

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-7209 is to be kept in a secure, windowless room with a single door. Access to DSC-MATE-7209 must only be granted by Level 4 personnel, and only under strict observation for signs of anomalous behavior. Any personnel entering DSC-MATE-7209’s containment chamber must wear a Level C hazmat suit and a respirator.

Description: DSC-MATE-7209 is a humanoid species known as ‘Politician’. DSC-MATE-7209 appears to be a male human, with distinct facial features that are marked by orange stripes. DSC-MATE-7209 typically wears a retro cap, a green cross earring, a red scarf, and a gas mask, regardless of environmental conditions. DSC-MATE-7209’s behavior is characterized by a rebellious streak, which often leads to bending or breaking rules for the sake of amusement.

DSC-MATE-7209 has demonstrated anomalous abilities that allow for it to manipulate others through its political machinations. DSC-MATE-7209 has been observed making deals and political alliances, often with devastating consequences for those involved. DSC-MATE-7209’s motives for this behavior remain unclear.

DSC-MATE-7209 has demonstrated some level of resistance to physical injury and is capable of self-healing. This indicates some degree of regenerative ability, although the full extent of these capabilities remains unknown.

Upon entering DSC-MATE-7209’s containment, subjects report a sense of unease and discomfort. This is believed to be caused by DSC-MATE-7209’s anomalous effects, which can influence those around it in subtle, yet profound ways.

Further research is necessary to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-7209’s abilities and determine an appropriate course of action for containment. Until such time, DSC-MATE-7209 must be kept under strict observation and confined to its secure chamber. Any attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-7209 must be approved by Level 4 personnel beforehand.
