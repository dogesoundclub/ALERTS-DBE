Despite his lighthearted nature, SCP-1274 remains vigilant and cautious at all times.

SCP-1274 came to the Foundation's attention after several reports of strange occurrences in the theaters under his management.

SCP-1274 was eventually recruited by the Foundation and given the designation SCP-1274.

Addendum: SCP-1274 has been observed interacting with several other SCPs, including SCP-999 and SCP-2295. While SCP-1274's interactions have not caused any breaches, caution should be exercised when allowing SCP-1274 to interact with other SCPs.
