Item #: 2970

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2970 is to be allowed free movement within the city limits, provided he maintains a low profile and does not draw undue attention to himself. He is to report in to Foundation handlers monthly for monitoring of anomalous behavior.

Description: Subject 2970 is a human male of average height and build. Unique features include bright orange stripes on the face, a smile that never seems to fade, and a red victory band across the forehead. He wears a gold earring in one ear and sports a gold chain around his neck. Most notably, he wears a normal gas mask, which he claims is for his protection against toxins in the environment.

Subject 2970 works as a mechanic and has shown no abnormalities in his day-to-day life. However, he has exhibited strong idealistic tendencies and often engages in humorous protests or boycotts against companies or causes that go against his values. His desire to make the world a better place has led him to cross paths with several anomalous entities, but he has yet to show any defensive or aggressive behavior towards them.

Addendum: Subject 2970 has shown a sudden increase in interest in the paranormal phenomenon and has expressed a desire to work with the Foundation in containing and studying them. Further monitoring is required.
