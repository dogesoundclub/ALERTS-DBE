Item #: SCP-4094

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4094 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a reinforced steel door and monitored at all times by at least two armed guards. Absolutely no interaction or physical contact is allowed with SCP-4094 without the express permission of O5-██.

Description: SCP-4094 is a male Tiger of undetermined age and origin, working as a Train Driver for a passenger railway company in North America. SCP-4094 appears humanlike, wearing a hoodie with a red scarf accessory. The true nature of SCP-4094's eyes is unknown as they are hidden behind the hoodie. SCP-4094 exhibits no abnormal physical traits in regards to his species, aside from his humanoid appearance.

SCP-4094's personality is characterized by a hyperactive and enthusiastic demeanor. SCP-4094 has an insatiable thirst for excitement and desires to share his sense of thrill with others, often resulting in humorous situations where others may not share SCP-4094's level of enthusiasm for a particular event or object.

SCP-4094's origin is unknown, and no attempts for interrogation have been made due to the potential risk involved in interacting with SCP-4094. It is believed that SCP-4094's anomalous properties are linked to his dual nature as a Tiger in human form, but this theory cannot be confirmed at this time.

Addendum: SCP-4094's position as a Train Driver makes his containment and observation a challenging task for the Foundation. SCP-4094's job necessitates his presence outside of the containment chamber and among the general public, which poses a significant risk to the Foundation's secrecy. Plans are currently in development to address this issue, but until then, heightened security protocols are to be enforced. Any attempts to approach SCP-4094 or interfere with his job are to be met with lethal force.
