Item #: SCP-3504

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3504 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced locking mechanism. Any requests for additional amenities must be submitted in writing and approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.

Description: SCP-3504 is a human female of average height and weight, with a distinct feature of dark spots covering her face. SCP-3504's appearance is further distinguished by her purple lips and orange eyebrows that contrast with her otherwise unremarkable skin tone.

SCP-3504's accessories consist of a gold chain necklace and a cigarette, which she often smokes while in her containment chamber. Additionally, her personality is often characterized by her rebellious tendencies and an insatiable desire to push boundaries.

SCP-3504 is a farmer by profession, although to what extent she engages in this occupation is unknown. Notably, SCP-3504 has been observed to purposely break rules or bend them in unorthodox ways, often leading to humorous situations or unexpected consequences.

Despite SCP-3504's playful personality, caution should be exercised when interacting with her as she can become uncooperative or even hostile if her boundaries are violated. SCP-3504 has been known to test facility security measures, and as such, all interactions should be carefully monitored for potential breaches.

Addendum: SCP-3504 has expressed a desire to continue farming and has requested access to a small plot of land and gardening supplies. This request is currently under review by personnel.
