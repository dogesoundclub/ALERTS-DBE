Item #: 5860

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item 5860 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a comfortable bed, a small bookshelf, and appropriate electrical outlets. The chamber should be lined with soundproof and light-resistant materials to avoid any stimuli that may agitate the subject. Any time an interaction is needed, two Class-C personnel are required to gently coax the subject out of containment and lead it to a designated area.

Description: Item 5860 is a male rabbit seemingly at the age of 27, stands at 5.5ft, and with bluish-grey fur. A blue bandana has been found wrapped tightly around the subject's head, one silver chain, and an LED gas mask that is attached to the chain. The origin of these accessories has yet to be discovered. The eyes of the subject remain unknown due to the constant use of the LED gas mask, masking the wearer's face.

Item 5860 previously worked as a Police Officer at [REDACTED], but it was noticed that his behaviors seem out of the ordinary to the rest of the force. They tend to act on impulse and tend to take risks that end up in humorous situations. The risks involved include jumping off a cliff into a lake or river. We caution all personnel to be aware of Item 5860's personality and current status. 

The item can communicate through sign language and body language in addition to its human-like speech ability.  While it remains unclear how the subject acquired such capabilities, the skills seem innate to the particular species.

Addendum

Submission - Researcher Jackson

Upon interviewing Item 5860, I have gathered some detailed personal preferences and behavioral tendencies that may assist with its containment. The subject has an intense craving for bananas and may interact positively with a subject bringing bananas as a prize.

Moreover, It has expressed an interest in singing and performing in a band.  It has requested the band name to be "The Hopping Hares".  Subject seems to be pleased with herself when successful in tasks given, leading to a better chance of proper containment etiquette.
