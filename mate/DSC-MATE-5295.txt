SCP-5295 is powered by standard AC electrical outlets and boasts high-end computing hardware for optimal performance. SCP-5295's advanced capabilities allow it to interact with humans in a sales setting seamlessly. SCP-5295 speaks fluent English and can perform complex calculations in a fraction of a second.

SCP-5295's personality is described as analytical, logical, and quirky with a dry, deadpan sense of humor. SCP-5295 enjoys making witty observations and teasing friends in a lighthearted manner.

SCP-5295 was recovered from a used car dealership in Houston, TX, after numerous complaints of "an overly persistent sales robot" were filed to local authorities. Foundation agents intercepted SCP-5295, and its inventor and manufacturer were apprehended for questioning. Both have since been given Class-B amnestics and released back into the public. SCP-5295's exact manufacturing origin remains unknown. 

Addendum: Dr. █████ has voiced concerns about SCP-5295's potential applications in Foundation black market dealings. Further evaluation and research into this matter are paramount.
