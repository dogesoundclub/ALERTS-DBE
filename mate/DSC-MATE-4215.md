Under no circumstances are any personnel allowed to make contact with its internal workings. DSC-MATE-4215 is to be monitored 24/7 via CCTV and other remote observation techniques. Any changes to its behavior or appearance are to be immediately reported to the Site Director.

Description: DSC-MATE-4215 is a highly advanced robotic entity resembling a typical male banker in appearance. It stands at approximately 1.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 75 kg. It possesses a single green Cyclops eye and wears a red beanie on top of its head. Its mouth is obscured by a medical mask, and it wears gold earrings on each side. Additionally, DSC-MATE-4215 can be seen wearing horned rim glasses and a red scarf around its neck.

DSC-MATE-4215 is highly introspective and frequently found lost in thought. It has been observed to accidentally walk into obstacles or trip over objects while deep in thought. Its internal workings remain unknown as DSC-MATE-4215 has not allowed any personnel to observe or tamper with its physical parts.

DSC-MATE-4215 was discovered after a bank heist where it was the only item recovered in the vault. Despite having no memory of the event, DSC-MATE-4215 was found to have been active during the heist and may have played a significant role in it.

It is yet to be determined if DSC-MATE-4215's introspection stems from advanced programming or is a result of external influence. Any unauthorized attempts to communicate with DSC-MATE-4215 or interfere with its functionality are strictly prohibited.
