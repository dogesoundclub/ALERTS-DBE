Subject 8408 is classified as a human security guard assigned to protect and safeguard urban areas. However, their appearance is anything but ordinary. Their face exhibits distinct orange stripes clustered around a bright red lip, enhanced by VR rainbow LED eyes that augments their vision in darker settings.

Their head is covered by a bucket hat, with goggles secured to their forehead to add additional protection to the eyes, while their green cross earring adorns their ear. Their mouth is hidden behind a medical mask, presumably to keep their identity hidden from potential threats. A choker serves as their main accessory, completing this enigmatic look.

While their appearance certainly attracts attention, their personality is what sets them apart. They possess an unwavering sense of duty and responsibility, but they also know how to have a good time. They have a unique ability to lighten the mood, be the life of the party and get everyone singing and dancing along to their favorite tunes.

Subject 8408 is a fascinating and complex character, one that should be viewed with both respect and admiration.
