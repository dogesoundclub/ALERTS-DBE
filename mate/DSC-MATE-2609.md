Description:

DSC-MATE-2609 appears to be a female humanoid of the species Homo sapiens, with short black hair and spots on their face. DSC-MATE-2609 also possesses a distinctive purple lip and a gold chain around their neck. Their eyes are replaced with Virtual Reality Jade LED, and their ears are adorned with Jade Earrings.

DSC-MATE-2609 works as a veterinarian, and their primary function is to care for animals that have been damaged or infected by anomalous means. DSC-MATE-2609 possesses certain abilities that allow them to interact with and heal animals in ways that normal veterinarians cannot.

DSC-MATE-2609's personality is introspective and contemplative- they have a tendency to get lost in their thoughts and daydreams, often to their own detriment. They frequently trip or walk into objects while in deep thought, and are prone to losing track of time. Despite this, DSC-MATE-2609 is an invaluable asset to the Foundation due to their unique abilities and medical expertise.

Addendum:

DSC-MATE-2609 has recently shown signs of increased aggression and unpredictability. It is believed that these changes in personality are a result of prolonged exposure to anomalous animals and their effects. Further study is needed to determine the cause and potential danger posed by these changes.
