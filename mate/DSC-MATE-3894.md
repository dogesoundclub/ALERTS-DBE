Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3894 is to be monitored at all times, and access to public speaking engagements, and media appearances must be closely monitored and approved by the Foundation.

Description: Subject 3894 is a Caucasian male standing at 6'1 and weighing approximately 185lbs. His most notable feature is his ski goggle eyes that emit a hypnotic blue glow when he speaks, leading many to succumb to his persuasive rhetoric. Subject 3894 is always seen wearing a gold chain and a green cross earring on his left ear. Additionally, he often carries a candy stick that he absentmindedly licks while deep in thought.

Subject 3894's- human appearance is the only known species. However, it is believed that his ability to manipulate crowds and sway opinions is not entirely natural, leading some to theorize that he may have unknown supernatural abilities.

Personality: Despite his public persona as a charismatic politician, Subject 3894 is introspective, and he spends long periods lost in thought or daydreaming. This leads to accidents such as bumping into walls or tripping over objects, making 3894 appear clumsy or absent-minded. Additionally, upon further investigation, it has become clear that his introspection often borders on obsession, leading some to believe that he may be struggling with mental health issues.

Note: Subject 3894 has caught the attention of the Foundation due to his ability to sway large numbers of people to his side, and for his potential supernatural abilities. Further investigation and monitoring of Subject 3894 are required.
