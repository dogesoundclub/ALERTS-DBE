Item #: 3587

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-3587, also known as "The Tiger," is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell, complete with a bed, toilet, and writing desk. The room must be kept clean and free of debris, as SCP-3587 has a tendency to daydream and may become disoriented if they trip or fall.

Description:

SCP-3587 is a male tiger of an unknown subspecies, standing at approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing over 150 kilograms. SCP-3587's facial features include a constantly frightened-looking mouth and VR jade LED eyes. The top of SCP-3587's head is covered by a doge hat, and a silver chain can be found around the subject's neck. Additionally, SCP-3587 has a gold earring in its left ear and wears a medical mask over its snout.

SCP-3587 is known to be introspective and often spends a great deal of time lost in thought or daydreaming. This behavior has led to numerous comical incidents, such as SCP-3587 walking into poles or tripping over debris. Despite these humorous occurrences, SCP-3587 is generally well-behaved and docile, preferring to spend its time reading or writing poetry.

SCP-3587 possesses no extraordinary abilities or anomalous properties, making it an ideal candidate for use within the Foundation's traffic police division. The subject has been successfully trained to assist in redirecting vehicular traffic in accordance with Foundation safety protocols.

Addendum:

SCP-3587 was acquired by the Foundation after being discovered during a routine traffic stop in the outskirts of [REDACTED], Canada. Foundation operatives quickly identified the subject as anomalous and transported it to Site-██ for containment and study.
