Addendum: 

Item 5102 has expressed a desire to join the SCP Foundation's Security department as a guard, claiming that its natural agility and speed would make it an asset in the field. This request has been denied, as the potential risks of granting Item 5102 access to high-level security areas outweigh any potential benefits.
