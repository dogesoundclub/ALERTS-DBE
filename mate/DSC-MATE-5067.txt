Special Containment Procedures: Subject 5067 is to be kept in a secured containment chamber at all times, with no unauthorized personnel allowed access. Access to Subject 5067 is only allowed with Level 4 authorization and must be accompanied by a trained animal handler. Any attempts by Subject 5067 to escape must be dealt with immediately. No weapons are allowed within 10 meters of the containment chamber.

Description: Subject 5067 is a male monkey, identified as a farmer. The subject has an unusual appearance, as it wears a hooded sweatshirt and nerd glasses. It is frequently seen wearing a red scarf and smoking a cigarette.

Subject 5067 displays a strong sense of independence and often shows defiance towards authority, considering rules unnecessary or unjust. This may cause unpredictable and sometimes, dangerous behaviors, including assaults on personnel or attempts at escaping containment.

Nevertheless, subject 5067 displays above-average intelligence and may demonstrate problem-solving or critical thinking abilities. It is recommended that access to any equipment or tools be strictly monitored and controlled.

Assessment and Analysis: The subject's rebellious and non-conformist tendencies make it a dangerous and difficult specimen to control. Therefore, caution must be exercised even when handling Subject 5067 with trained personnel. The subject must be kept under close surveillance and be closely monitored in its containment at all times.

Addendum: It appears that Subject 5067 has developed a peculiar attraction to bananas, as it has been observed on several instances becoming deeply engrossed in manipulating the fruit as if it were a puzzle. Possible experimentation with bananas is currently under evaluation by researchers.
