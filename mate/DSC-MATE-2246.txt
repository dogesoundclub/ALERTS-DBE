Item #: SCP-2246

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2246 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Its diet is to consist of organic vegetables and grains. It is allowed in a designated outdoor area for recreational purposes twice a week, under the supervision of at least two armed guards.

Description: SCP-2246 appears to be a male humanoid rabbit, standing at approximately 1.5 meters tall. Its head is not arranged in the typical fashion of a rabbit, instead taking on an unnatural, leafy green hue. Its ears are adorned with a single jade earring in each, and it regularly sports a gold chain as an accessory.

Personality-wise, SCP-2246 displays a remarkable degree of empathy and understanding for others. It has been observed to be moved to tears or emotional outbursts when witnessing another's pain or suffering. Additionally, SCP-2246 seems to harbor a special affinity for animals and nature.

It should be noted that SCP-2246 was formerly employed as a police officer prior to being taken into Foundation custody. SCP-2246 has yet to fully adjust to its new environment, displaying a preference for grassy areas and the occasional habit of attempting to burrow.

Addendum: SCP-2246 has been allowed to participate in several volunteer programs involving therapy animals. Its presence has been observed to have a significant calming effect on distressed individuals. Further research into this application is ongoing.
