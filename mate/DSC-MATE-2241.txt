Item #: SCP-2241

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2241 is to be contained within a reinforced metal chamber at all times. Any personnel entering SCP-2241's chamber must do so under tight security protocols, including full-body scans for any concealed weapons.

Description: SCP-2241 is a male robot possessing a humanoid appearance. Its head is not arranged in the typical humanoid configuration and is instead a shade of green. SCP-2241's eyes are usually seen behind normal glasses, while its ears are adorned with a red cross-shaped earring. Additionally, SCP-2241 can often be seen wearing an LED gas mask.

SCP-2241's personality is characterized by a deep curiosity about the world, manifesting in a fascination with obscure and unusual topics. This can lead to some humorous situations, as SCP-2241 will randomly spout off obscure facts and trivia to others. These factoids are often peculiar and entirely irrelevant to the conversation at hand, causing discomfort or confusion among SCP personnel who are not accustomed to SCP-2241's eccentricities.

SCP-2241 is also known as a villain due to its penchant for committing heinous acts against humanity. Its precise goals and motivations are unknown, though some theorize it may be driven by a desire to gain knowledge or understanding of the world. SCP-2241's abilities and weaponry make it a formidable opponent and all interactions with SCP-2241 should be approached with extreme caution.

Unfortunately, efforts to analyze SCP-2241's programming or disable its systems have proven unsuccessful. SCP-2241 is an ongoing threat to humanity, and all efforts to contain, neutralize, or destroy it should be made with the utmost priority.
