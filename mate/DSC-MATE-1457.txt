Item #: SCP-1457

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1457 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Due to its species as a Tiger, special precautional measurements should be taken when entering SCP-1457's cell. Standard animal handling protocols and appropriate security measures should be followed. SCP-1457 has requested some items, such as a silver chain and a cigarette to be allowed to keep in its cell as comfort items. They must be checked for any anomalies before allowing SCP-1457 to possess them. Any changes in behavior or unusual activities should be reported immediately to the Site Director.

Description: SCP-1457, also known as "Guardian," is a male tiger with horned rim glasses on his amber eyes. On its forehead, there is a red victory band, and on its ears, there is a red cross earring. Despite its intimidating appearance, SCP-1457 has a gentle and empathetic personality. It has a profound understanding and kindness towards human emotions and often feels moved by others' pain and suffering, occasionally leading to emotional outbursts or shedding tears. SCP-1457 also shows love towards nature and other animals.

SCP-1457's current role is that of a security guard at the Foundation. It has demonstrated high levels of alertness and capabilities during its duties. However, SCP-1457's emotional and empathetic traits pose a challenge in potentially traumatic situations in the field. SCP-1457 has been assigned to low-to moderate-risk zones and limited access to valuable items and spaces due to the possibility of its mental state in distress.

Addendum 1457-1: SCP-1457 experienced a sudden depression after witnessing the death of a stray cat in the Site. SCP-1457 struggled for several hours before being calmed by the on-site psychologist. SCP-1457 is to be regularly checked up by a leading psychologist for any such similar incidents.

Addendum 1457-2: SCP-1457 has shown some progress in controlling its empathetic responses in potentially traumatic situations. Assigned to a more stable zone, SCP-1457's emotional balance has improved significantly, but caution must be taken to not exploit its empathetic behavior as it might lead to severe emotional distress.

Note: SCP-1457 shows excellent potential for SCP-therapy programs. Making use of its emotional balance and empathetic nature may lead to producing new treatments for spiritual therapies in the future. The proposal is currently under review by the Ethics Committee.
