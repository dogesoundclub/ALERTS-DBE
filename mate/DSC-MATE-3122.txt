Item #: SCP-3122

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3122 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit when not in use. Due to its delivery driver occupation, it is allowed to freely move around within designated areas. However, any attempts to exit these areas are to be reported immediately to security personnel. All deliveries made by SCP-3122 are to be carefully monitored to ensure no anomalous activity occurs.

Description: SCP-3122 is a male robot with green cyclops eye, ski goggle eyes, and a retro cap. It wears a jade earring, silver chain, and an LED gas mask as accessories. SCP-3122 is capable of performing human-like actions, such as driving a vehicle and interacting with humans with the aid of text-to-speech software.

SCP-3122 possesses a unique personality, often exhibiting rebellious tendencies and a penchant for pushing boundaries. This can lead to humorous situations, such as deliberately breaking rules or finding ways to bend them for amusement. While generally cooperative, SCP-3122 has been known to act on its own accord, causing concern for possible undiscovered abilities or influences.

Addendum: It is the belief of the SCP Foundation that SCP-3122 may possess more anomalous properties than previously recorded. Due to its potential risk and unpredictability, further research is necessary to determine the extent of its abilities and behaviors.
