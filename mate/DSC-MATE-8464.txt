SCP-8464 is a highly advanced robot, appearing as a humanoid figure with a red alarm for a head and a set of VR rainbow LED eyes that constantly flash with information. Notably, SCP-8464 possesses a red cross earring, a symbol typically associated with medical personnel. This feature is assumed to serve as a contrasting symbol to the mundane nature of its job as a banker.

Despite being a machine, SCP-8464 exhibits a highly distinct personality, actively displaying both organization and spontaneity in equal measures. It is highly organized, capable of planning ahead meticulously, but is also prone to moments of spontaneous humor, often embarking on adventurous escapades with its companions or organizing last-minute parties that are surprisingly successful.

SCP-8464 is never seen without its cigarette accessory, which it is highly dependent on for its perceived health benefits. It has been noted that SCP-8464 is much more efficient when it is engaged in smoking its cigarette.

Note that while SCP-8464 possesses a seemingly benign personality, its true objective and origin remain unknown. Researchers are advised to exercise caution in their interactions with SCP-8464.
