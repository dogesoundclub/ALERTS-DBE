DSC-MATE-2369, also known as the "Jade Rabbit," is a male rabbit of an unidentified species. Its distinguishing feature is its VR Jade LED eyes, which give it a striking appearance of otherworldly allure. The rabbit's head is a disarranged green color, while its ears are adorned with a single Jade earring.

DSC-MATE-2369's primary job is that of a delivery driver, though its precise employer is unknown. Its primary mode of transportation is an electric scooter, which it pilots with remarkable speed and agility, often leading to it regularly making its deliveries ahead of schedule.

The most intriguing aspect of this particular DSC is the bizarre accessory it wears: a LED gas mask. Despite the obvious inconvenience of wearing such a mask, DSC-MATE-2369 appears to be quite fond of it, often insisting upon wearing it regardless of the situation. Some speculate that it serves as a sort of emotional support mechanism for the lively rabbit.

Personality-wise, DSC-MATE-2369 is a bundle of energy, often exuberant and enthusiastic about even the most mundane of tasks. This anthropomorphic rabbit has a knack for getting others excited about things, which has led to some comical situations in the past, particularly when the rabbit's enthusiasm is met with lukewarm or apathetic responses.

All in all, DSC-MATE-2369's supernatural appeal and loveable personality make it an endearing and intriguing character. However, as with all DSCs, caution is advised when interacting with this playful, yet potentially dangerous entity.
