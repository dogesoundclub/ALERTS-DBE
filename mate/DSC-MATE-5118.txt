Item #: SCP-5118

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5118 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a minimum size of 4m x 4m x 4m. The chamber is to be equipped with ample climbing materials and opportunities for physical exercise. SCP-5118 is to be fed three meals a day, with daily health checks and medical evaluations conducted by a licensed veterinarian.

Description: SCP-5118 is a male monkey of uncertain species, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall and weighing roughly 50kg. The monkey bears an expression of constant fear, as evidenced by its tight-lipped and frequently trembling mouth. Its eyes are difficult to discern due to rapid blinking and constant movement. SCP-5118 wears a police cap on its head, and a 2-color band adorns its forehead.

SCP-5118 carries two accessories at all times. The first is a gold chain around its neck, with no known significance. The second is a standard gas mask, worn at all times and presumably used to filter out harmful airborne agents. It is unknown how SCP-5118 came into possession of the gas mask.

SCP-5118's personality is marked by an intense drive to accomplish tasks and make decisions efficiently. This can occasionally be interpreted as bossiness or intimidation, but is simply a reflection of SCP-5118's need for order and structure. Despite its constant terror, SCP-5118 is capable of exhibiting aggression and assertiveness when necessary.

SCP-5118's job is that of a lawyer, although how it acquired its position remains unknown. It is capable of basic communication in human languages, although its speech is limited and often incoherent.

Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-5118 was found to possess a previously undiscovered anomalous ability - the ability to briefly freeze time around itself in periods of extreme stress or fear. Testing is ongoing to determine the full extent of this ability and its potential uses.
