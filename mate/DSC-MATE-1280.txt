SCP-1280, also known as "The Lawyer", is a male monkey standing at approximately 3 feet tall. He wears a retro cap with a two-color band and a red scarf around his neck. At all times he holds a lit cigarette in his hand.

Despite being a monkey, SCP-1280 has shown an uncanny ability to understand human emotions and thus pursues a career in law. SCP-1280 tends to be incredibly empathetic and compassionate in his dealings, which has earned him a reputation as a helpful and reliable lawyer.

However, his empathetic nature often leads him to take on more than he can handle. He has a tendency to become invested in the problems of others, feeling a personal responsibility to fix everything and everyone around him. This trait, while admirable, can sometimes become exhausting and lead to poor decision-making.

SCP-1280 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, which should be furnished appropriately to meet his needs. Access to cigarettes is to be limited to one at a time, with all ashes and butts disposed of properly. All interactions with SCP-1280 should be monitored by staff who are trained to handle non-human entities.
