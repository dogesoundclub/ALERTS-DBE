Addendum 6381-A: Recovery Log

DSC-MATE-6381 was recovered in 20██ from a hidden bunker located deep beneath the city of Tokyo. The DogeSoundClub was alerted to DSC-MATE-6381's existence by an informant within the Japanese government. The bunker was heavily fortified, and DSC-MATE-6381 was guarded by numerous heavily armed robots, all of whom were deactivated upon the Foundation's arrival.
