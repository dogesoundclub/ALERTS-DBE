SCP-9391 is a human male and news anchor whose unusual physical appearance sets him apart from the rest. His mouth spot, a strange red splotch on his face, only adds to the enigmatic aura he exudes. Yet he wears a smile that seems to suggest he knows more than he lets on. SCP-9391's blue clown eyes appear to be a manifestation of some unknown power he possesses, as they glow with an unnatural intensity at times. 

Further enhancing his otherworldly quality is the metal purple head he sports, which gleams iridescently in the light. The gold earring he wears only adds to his mysterious allure, suggesting a possible connection to a secret society or organization. 

Despite his secretive demeanor, SCP-9391's rebellious nature is easily discernible. He enjoys pushing boundaries and defying expectations, often finding humor in the chaos that ensues. He is not above breaking rules or bending them to suit his needs, and seems to take delight in seeing how far he can go. 

SCP-9391's red scarf is a final accessory that adds a pop of color to his otherwise dark attire, and seems to hold some special significance to him. He has been known to use it as a distraction or to draw attention to specific areas when reporting news stories, suggesting a talent for subterfuge. 

Approach with caution, as SCP-9391's true motivations are unknown and he should not be underestimated.
