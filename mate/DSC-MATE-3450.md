ID # : DSC-MATE-3450
Description: 3450 is a humanoid female with typical physical features. Her blonde hair is unique, however, as it appears to have a large wing emerging from her scalp. Her eyes are obscured by normal glasses, and she typically wears a jade earring in one ear. Her forehead bears a striking two-color band that has yet to be identified as any known symbol or sigil. 3450 is typically seen wearing a choker, which seems to have no anomalous properties.
