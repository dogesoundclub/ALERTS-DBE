Item #: 3171

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3171 is to be monitored remotely through her real estate office and personal electronic devices. Access to her files is strictly limited to Level 2 personnel. No physical interaction is allowed, and any sightings outside of her work environment are to be reported immediately.

Description: Subject 3171 is a Caucasian female human with blond hair, green cross earring, and normal glasses. Her most distinctive facial feature is the purple lip she wears at all times, partially concealed behind a medical mask. She can often be seen wearing a gold chain around her neck.

Her job title as a real estate agent is merely a front to conceal her true motivations. Subject 3171 shows a deep interest in acquiring knowledge of esoteric and obscure topics, often spending long periods of time reading or researching. She is fascinated by ancient civilizations, obscure folklore, and alternative history.

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of subject 3171 is her desire to share her newfound knowledge with others. She will go to great lengths to educate her peers about the arcane subjects that she has discovered. This behavior has led to many anxiety-ridden experiences for her coworkers, family, and friends.

Some researchers have speculated that her purple lip serves as a marker to identify herself to a clandestine organization of which she may be a part. However, no evidence has been found to support this theory.

Addendum 3171-A: Incident Report: On [REDACTED], Subject 3171 attempted to share information related to a supposed "sleeper cell" organization that she claimed was located within the city. The event led to a series of panic attacks on behalf of her coworkers, resulting in the termination of her employment. Further monitoring is required to avoid any further breaches in containment.
