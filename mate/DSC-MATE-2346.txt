Item #: SCP-2346

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2346 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished with a bed, desk, and basic amenities. Access to personal electronics and technological devices is permitted, barring any unauthorized communication with entities outside the Foundation.

SCP-2346 is entitled to bi-weekly psychiatric consultations with a qualified mental health professional, and is to receive regular medication maintenance therapy as prescribed by Foundation Medical Staff.

Description: SCP-2346 is a humanoid of the female sex, with unusual facial features. The subject bears bright orange stripes across their face, with their lips colored a deep red. SCP-2346 is frequently observed wearing a bucket hat and medical mask, alongside a gold chain accessory.

SCP-2346's occupation as a veterinarian prior to containment was discovered upon review of their personnel file. It is of note that although SCP-2346 is fully aware of their own species classification as human, there have been several documented instances of the subject anthropomorphizing inanimate objects in their environment. SCP-2346 has been observed assigning names and personalities to objects such as their patient tables, cleaning supplies, and even mechanical doors and cabinets.

SCP-2346 tends to be a very caring and nurturing individual, and is able to form strong, empathetic connections with both living and non-living things. This behavior is not limited to their work as a veterinarian, and extends to their daily life within containment. SCP-2346 appears to derive great joy and fulfillment from their interactions with their environment, and has often been observed engaging in small acts of kindness towards staff members and fellow SCPs.

Addendum: Following continued psychological analysis, it is the consensus of Foundation Medical Staff that SCP-2346's behavior is a coping mechanism resulting from a traumatic event early in their life. Further digging into SCP-2346's background is ongoing, with the hope of better understanding the source of their anomalous abilities.
