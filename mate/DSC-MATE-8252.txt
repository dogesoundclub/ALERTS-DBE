Item #: SCP-8252

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8252 is to be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards. Because of his position as a politician, no lethal actions are permitted unless authorized by O5 Council. SCP-8252 is to be kept in a special containment chamber that is impervious to his abilities. If SCP-8252 manages to escape his cell, a full lockdown of the facility will be initiated.

Description: SCP-8252 appears to be a human male in his mid-40s. SCP-8252's most noticeable features are his orange stripes on his face and his permanent smile. SCP-8252's eyes are covered with normal glasses, and the head is covered in a metal purple helmet. Other notable features are the gold earring and the goggle on his forehead. SCP-8252 is often seen wearing a gold chain around his neck.

SCP-8252's personality is scatterbrained and forgetful. He has a tendency to forget important appointments and get sidetracked easily. When he is not in his containment chamber, he will wander around aimlessly like a lost tourist. SCP-8252's forgetfulness makes him an unreliable witness, and his tendency to get sidetracked puts him at risk of being captured. SCP-8252 has an ability to manipulate the mind of others, making him a dangerous individual. The Foundation scientists believe that SCP-8252's abilities are similar to that of an amnesiac's.

Because of SCP-8252's position as a politician, some believe he was put in charge as part of a government cover-up. Others have speculated that SCP-8252 is a powerful anomaly that allows him to manipulate memories, but the true nature of SCP-8252 is still unknown.

Addendum: In an attempt to further understand SCP-8252's abilities, the Foundation began using him as a test subject for other anomalies similar to him. The results were inconclusive since SCP-8252 appeared immune to the alteration of memories, but unable to manipulate them himself. Furthermore, it appeared that SCP-8252 could only affect one mind at a time. Any attempts to use multiple minds resulted in a failure. The Foundation has since placed a limit on how often SCP-8252 can be tested.
