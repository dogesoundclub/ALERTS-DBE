Item #: 363

Object Class: Neutralized

Description: Subject 363 was a male human news anchor with distinctive spots scattered across his face, which he would often conceal behind thick nerd glasses. His head was encased in a metal purple helmet, giving him an imposing appearance. The subject was always seen with a cigarette in hand, emitting a cloud of smoke that seemed to linger unnaturally.

Personality: Subject 363 was known for his natural talent for leadership, often taking charge of situations both in and outside of work. Despite his commanding presence, he presented himself as an affable and charming individual to those around him. However, reports suggest that his tendency to micromanage and control every aspect of his life became increasingly apparent as time went on.

Notes: Subject 363 was initially believed to possess supernatural abilities, as physical anomalies often accompany magical powers in urban fantasy literature. However, further investigation revealed that his unique appearance was a result of experimentation conducted by a secret government agency. It is unknown whether the subject was aware of this or was simply a pawn in their grand scheme.

Following the discovery of the illegal experiments, Subject 363 was located and neutralized by a team of operatives from the DogeSoundClub. All traces of his involvement in the agency's activities have since been wiped clean, and his current whereabouts are unknown.
