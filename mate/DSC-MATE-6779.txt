Item #: 6779

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are advised to approach subject 6779 with caution due to their unpredictable nature. Subject 6779 is currently employed as a fast food worker in a local diner, and is to be monitored at all times while on duty. In the event of a containment breach, personnel are authorized to use tranquilizers and other non-lethal means to subdue the subject.

Description: SCP-6779 is a male tiger of indeterminate age, standing approximately 1.8 meters in height when upright. The subject wears a hoodie, with a two color band on their forehead and medical mask covering their mouth. They also wear normal glasses and a gold chain as an accessory. SCP-6779's personality tends to be introspective, spending a great deal of time daydreaming and lost in thought. This has been known to cause humorous mishaps, as they may not pay attention to their surroundings and walk into objects or trip over things.

SCP-6779 has exhibited a range of unusual abilities, including the ability to change the density of their body at will, allowing them to phase through solid objects. They have also displayed a heightened sense of smell, being able to detect the presence of other SCPs and anomalies from great distances. The subject's origin and how they acquired their anomalous traits are currently unknown.

Addendum: SCP-6779 has expressed a desire to be released from containment and to live a normal life outside of the Foundation. However, due to the potential dangers posed by their abilities, this request has been denied. SCP-6779 is to remain in Foundation custody until it can be determined that they pose no threats to society at large.
