Item #: DSC-MATE-396

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-396 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with all necessary amenities provided for basic human needs. Due to the nature of their personality, DSC-MATE-396 is to have access to therapy and counseling services, as well as regular visits from a designated therapist. Any animals brought into DSC-MATE-396's cell must first be cleared by a veterinarian and monitored for signs of distress.

Description: DSC-MATE-396 appears to be a human male of middle age, with a distinctive spot on their mouth. Their head is shaved bald in a traditional monk's style, and they wear a medical mask at all times. DSC-MATE-396 is always seen with a silver chain around their neck, which they often fidget with when nervous.

DSC-MATE-396 possesses a deep empathy and understanding for others, often becoming emotionally overwhelmed when exposed to suffering or pain. They are known to exhibit sudden and sometimes uncontrollable outbursts of emotion, such as crying or anger. DSC-MATE-396 also exhibits a fondness for animals and nature, often spending time in contemplation or caring for plants or animals in their confinement.

Although DSC-MATE-396's abilities do not appear to pose any direct danger to Foundation personnel, their unusual emotional responses and unpredictable behavior make containment difficult. It is recommended that all interactions with DSC-MATE-396 be conducted with the utmost caution and sensitivity.

Addendum: On ██/██/████, DSC-MATE-396 was observed exhibiting what appeared to be anomalous healing abilities. Further study is needed to determine the full extent of this ability and its implications for containment.
