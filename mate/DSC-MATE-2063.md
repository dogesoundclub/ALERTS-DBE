Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 2063 is currently assigned to the local police force and is to be monitored by Foundation agents for any unusual behavior. All his activities are to be logged and investigated.

Description: Subject 2063 is a male human of average height and build, with blue clown eyes and a characteristic mouth spot on his face. He is usually seen wearing his police officer uniform, complete with a police cap and a red scarf.

Subject 2063 displays a love for adventure, often taking risks and trying new experiences. This reckless behavior has led to several humorous stories, including surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping and getting lost in the wilderness on a hiking trip.

Subject 2063 also carries a candy stick with him at all times, which he claims helps him stay focused and calm during stressful situations.

It is important to note that Subject 2063's reckless behavior does not seem to negatively affect his performance as a police officer. In fact, he is an efficient and respected member of the force, often taking on challenging cases and successfully solving them.

Due to his unpredictable nature, however, it is still recommended to monitor Subject 2063 closely and intervene if his behavior becomes a threat to himself or others.
