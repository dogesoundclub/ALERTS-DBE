Item #: 9632

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9632 is to be held in a secure containment chamber at Site-███. The chamber should be no smaller than 10m x 10m and be designed to mimic a familiar environment to DSC-MATE-9632. A work desk with daily tasks to simulate a job is also provided to ensure DSC-MATE-9632's social behaviour is not disrupted. The containment chamber must also be temperature controlled to between 20°C and 25°C. 

DSC-MATE-9632 should be provided with opportunities to express their idealism as it helps to maintain their mental state. However, protests and boycotts directed at Foundation personnel are not allowed. Personnel registered with clearance level 2 or above are permitted to interact with DSC-MATE-9632 as long as they have express permission from at least one other member of staff. All contact with DSC-MATE-9632 must be supervised.

Description: DSC-MATE-9632 is a male monkey, of the species unknown, standing at approximately 60cm tall. DSC-MATE-9632 has red clown-like eyes, a mouth that displays constant fearfulness, and its head is adorned with a retro cap. DSC-MATE-9632's left ear features a jade earring, and it wears a red scarf around its neck. Despite its small size, DSC-MATE-9632 displays above-average intelligence and is capable of limited communication with Foundation personnel.

DSC-MATE-9632 also exhibits a peculiar pattern of behaviour due to its idealistic nature. It commonly expresses its ideals via peaceful protests and boycotts, even if said actions go against DSC-MATE-9632's best interests. For example, in the past, it staged a protest against a ball pit in a local restaurant because children were "being encouraged to swim in balls that represent deforestation." 

DSC-MATE-9632 is generally docile and cooperative with Foundation personnel who follow the established containment procedures. It has expressed a desire to make the world a better place in various conversations with Foundation personnel, and these ideas are often directed towards the Foundation. Hence, staff should exercise caution when interacting with DSC-MATE-9632, particularly when discussing ethically questionable Foundation practices. 

Nevertheless, DSC-MATE-9632's idealistic expressions are restricted to peaceful protests and boycotts. In summary, DSC-MATE-9632 is safe and manageable as long as it is kept safe and content, with no inappropriate stimulation to its idealistic beliefs.
