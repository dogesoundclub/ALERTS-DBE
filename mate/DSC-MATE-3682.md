Subject 3682, also known as "The Creative Car Saleswoman," is a human female with an unconventional appearance. Her eyes are a vibrant shade of orange, giving the impression of a smoldering ember. Her head is adorned with a thick and unruly mop of green hair that curls at the edges, resembling a cluster of vines twisting around her skull. Her ears are pierced with jade earrings, which dangle and sway with her every move.

As a car salesman, 3682 is adroit at selling cars, but she has an even more exceptional talent for driving her customers wild with her imaginative and creative approach to sales. From coming up with outlandish features and customizations to an already fantastical vehicle to giving each car a fantastical backstory, her clients leave the dealership feeling as if they were buying more than just a car, but a whole new experience.

Despite her quirky and zany nature, 3682's brainstorming ability is not to be taken lightly. As a natural creative, she can conceptualize novel solutions to the most challenging of problems. However, this trait makes her somewhat unpredictable, and her unusual problem-solving strategies are not always welcome.

Subject 3682 has been marked as neutral and harmless by our team. However, her creativity knows no bounds, and her unpredictable nature makes her impossible to completely evaluate. Handlers should keep in mind that her fanciful ideas may lead to unforeseen complications if not supervised appropriately.
