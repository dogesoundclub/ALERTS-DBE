Item #: SCP-2463

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2463 is to be kept separate from all other humanoid SCPs and housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. No personnel under the age of 18 are permitted to interact with SCP-2463. Security personnel are to maintain a distance of at least 5 meters from SCP-2463 at all times due to its anomalous properties.

Description:SCP-2463 is a human female theater manager, standing at 1.67 meters tall and weighing approximately 61 kg. SCP-2463's most notable feature is the orange stripes on its face, which extends from its forehead to its cheekbones. The subject has a permanent smile on its face, and its eyes are red clown eyes set deeper than non-anomalous eyes. SCP-2463's head is that of a pink rabbit and has a goggle on its forehead. SCP-2463's mouth is covered by a surgical mask.

SCP-2463 wears a gold chain around its neck, and on its left ear is a green cross earring. SCP-2463 often employs a dry sense of humor, easily catching those around it off guard with its deadpan delivery of jokes. It takes pleasure in witnessing the reactions of people to its jokes, finding even the most mundane situations amusing. SCP-2463's personality is often bubbly and happy-go-lucky, but this can be seen as disconcerting to those unfamiliar with its anomalous nature.

SCP-2463's anomalous properties manifest when the subject delivers a joke that results in laughter from others. When this occurs, SCP-2463's ears flap and twitch, emitting an anomalous energy into the surrounding environment. The effects of this anomalous energy are still being studied, but currently, it is known to result in the breakdown of electronics within a 10-meter radius of SCP-2463. Additionally, those within the range of SCP-2463's anomalous influence have reported intense feelings of happiness, often leading to euphoria and erratic behavior.

SCP-2463 was recovered from a circus in [REDACTED], where it was working as a clown. Local authorities reported high levels of electrical interference in the area of the circus, leading to Foundation intervention. SCP-2463 was taken into Foundation custody and classified as Euclid due to the unpredictable effects of its laughter. Further study is ongoing.
