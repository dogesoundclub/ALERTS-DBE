Item #: SCP-2451

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2451 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not in use for testing. All personnel assigned to SCP-2451 are required to wear Level A hazmat suits when in close proximity due to their gas mask accessory. Any attempts by SCP-2451 to move or manipulate furniture or navigate without proper aids must be carefully monitored to avoid injury or damage.

Description: SCP-2451 appears to be a human female of average height and build, with vibrant rainbow LED eyes and green hair styled in an edge curl. They wear a standard gas mask as an accessory, which has been tested and confirmed to function properly. SCP-2451 displays a strong sense of independence, even to the point of stubbornly rejecting assistance when it is clearly needed. Despite this, they have shown no signs of physical or mental abnormalities.

Addendum: SCP-2451's politicianship has been discovered through covert surveillance, and it is suspected that they may have connections to a powerful supernatural entity. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of their involvement in the supernatural community.
