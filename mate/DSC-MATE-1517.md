Item #: 1517

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-1517 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Standard amenities are to be provided, and personnel are to avoid provoking DSC-MATE-1517. Physical contact with DSC-MATE-1517 is strictly forbidden.

Description: DSC-MATE-1517 is a male tiger who poses as a delivery driver. DSC-MATE-1517 is easily recognizable due to the police cap on its head, jade earring on its right ear, and a red scarf around its neck. Its blue clown eyes and frightened mouth further set it apart from ordinary tigers. DSC-MATE-1517 has been observed carrying a candy stick while on duty.

DSC-MATE-1517 is introverted but not withdrawn. It spends time daydreaming or lost in thought, which can lead to some humorous situations, such as accidentally walking into a pole or tripping over something while lost in thought. DSC-MATE-1517 is known to be somber and may become reclusive if pushed too hard.

Despite its introverted nature, DSC-MATE-1517 can communicate effectively with others. However, it has a short tolerance for those who try to engage it aggressively, and it cannot withstand unnecessary physical contact. DSC-MATE-1517 is easily frightened and will instinctively lash out if it perceives a threat, so caution must be exercised when interacting with it.

Addendum: On 02/20/20██, DSC-MATE-1517 was involved in an altercation with a pedestrian who tried to pet it. DSC-MATE-1517 bit the pedestrian, causing massive injury, and was detained by local authorities. Following this incident, DSC-MATE-1517 was transferred to [REDACTED] Research Facility for further study. Further testing will be conducted to determine if DSC-MATE-1517's aggressive tendencies can be mitigated.
