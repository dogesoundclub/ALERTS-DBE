DSC-MATE-9656, also known as the "Gifted Engineer," is a human male with a keen eye for detail. His facial features are marked with small spots that dot his cheeks and forehead, but his most distinguishable trait is his thick-rimmed, nerd glasses that reflect the world in a shimmering glaze. His blonde hair is styled in a traditional, conservative manner.

DSC-MATE-9656's job is that of a train driver, where he expertly navigates the Illinois central railway down the tracks. He is adorned with a silver chain, which is engraved with an insignia that is unknown at this time. A candy stick is always clenched between his teeth, as it is a habit he has had since childhood.

DSC-MATE-9656's personality is incredibly attentive and observant. He has a knack for analyzing even the smallest of details, making him a handy asset for the Foundation's investigations. His attention to detail also extends to his gift-giving abilities, where he strives to find the perfect present for every person he meets. However, this often leads to him spending an excessive amount of time agonizing over the selection, resulting in overthinking and stress.

Further research is required to determine if DSC-MATE-9656 possesses any anomalous properties related to his keen observation skills or if he is simply a naturally gifted individual. Regardless, he is an asset to the Foundation and is to be monitored closely.
