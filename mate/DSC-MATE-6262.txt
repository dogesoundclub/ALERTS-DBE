Item #: SCP-6262

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6262 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, measuring 3m x 3m x 3m. The containment cell must be equipped with a ventilation system, able to filter out any airborne toxins. A standard gas mask must be provided to SCP-6262 at all times.

Description: SCP-6262 is a female human, with orange eyebrow-like markings around their eyes. Their head features an additional protrusion resembling a wing, while their ears have a red cross earring on them. They wear a normal gas mask as an accessory for personal reasons.

Despite their seemingly unusual appearance, SCP-6262 is a skilled car salesman with a natural talent for brainstorming innovative ideas. They enjoy presenting their creative solutions to problems, even if their suggestions may come across as absurd or outlandish to others.

While SCP-6262 appears to be a fairly ordinary human in terms of their physical abilities, their personality and thought processes can often display unpredictable and potentially hazardous behavior. It is advised that any interactions with SCP-6262 be conducted with caution, and under strict supervision.

Addendum: SCP-6262 has been observed attempting to sell cars to Foundation personnel during their containment. Consequently, access to car dealerships has been restricted for all personnel. SCP-6262 has been reprimanded and reminded of the conditions of their containment.
