Designation: DSC-MATE-126 "The Fast Food Fortune Teller"

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

DSC-MATE-126 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. They are allowed free roam of their cell and are granted access to entertainment and leisure facilities, as well as regular visits from a clinical psychologist. Due to their tendency towards precognition, DSC-MATE-126 is to be monitored regularly for signs of danger or disaster.

DSC-MATE-126 is to be employed as a fast food worker at a designated site, with intervals of no more than three months between rotations. All staff working at the site are to be informed of DSC-MATE-126's anomalous nature and instructed to provide standard containment protocol on-site.

Description:

DSC-MATE-126 is a human female, appearing to be in their mid-twenties. They stand at 1.65 meters tall, with long black hair and a red lip. They can often be seen wearing a purple cap with a headset, a choker, and a green cross earring in their left ear.

DSC-MATE-126 has displayed a strong intuition and seemingly precognitive abilities. They can predict events before they occur and senses when an individual is feeling anxious or upset. Due to this ability, they have earned the designation "The Fast Food Fortune Teller."

DSC-MATE-126's precognition abilities are not fully understood, and it is not known if their abilities are linked to any particular stimuli or trigger. However, given their propensity for danger, DSC-MATE-126 is to be monitored vigilantly.

Addendum:

While originally discovered during routine Foundation surveillance, DSC-MATE-126's ability to diffuse high-pressure situations and their ability to allay distress has proven immensely useful. In particular, their employment at fast food sites has allowed for rapid containment of anomalous entities in the area. Their presence at the local fast-food restaurant has even increased business and employee retention rates. As such, their continued work and casual observation may prove beneficial in further containment operations.
