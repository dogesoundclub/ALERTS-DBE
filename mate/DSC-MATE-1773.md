Item #: 1773

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: 1773 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times when not on duty. 1773's access to tools and electronic equipment must be strictly monitored and limited.

Description: 1773 is a male humanoid of the Homo sapiens species. The subject's most distinct feature is their vibrant orange stripes, which cover various parts of their body. They also have a purple cap with a headset and a jade earring. 1773's eyes are equipped with VR Rainbow LED technology, capable of projecting various images and symbols to aid with their work as a mechanic.

1773 is highly ambitious and goal-oriented, often taking on projects beyond their assigned duties. However, they possess exceptional organizational skills and strategic thinking that allow them to succeed in their endeavors. 1773 is often seen wearing a gold chain and carrying a candy stick, which they use to help them focus and relax during stressful situations.

Despite their exceptional skills, 1773 can push themselves beyond their limits, leading to potential hazards to themselves and those around them. It is important for proper monitoring and regulation to prevent any potential accidents or mishandling of equipment.

Addendum: 1773 has shown a particular interest in anomalous technology and has requested further access to the Foundation's research and development department. This request is currently under review by supervising personnel.
