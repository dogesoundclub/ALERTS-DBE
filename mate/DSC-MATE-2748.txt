Item #: SCP-2748

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-2748 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with various climbing structures and objects to keep SCP-2748 physically stimulated. Additionally, a whistle identical to that which SCP-2748 carries should be provided in the chamber at all times.

SCP-2748 is permitted to leave its chamber for work purposes only. When doing so, it must be escorted by no less than two Level 2 personnel at all times. Should SCP-2748 display any sudden or erratic behavior, it is to be subdued immediately and returned to its chamber for extensive observation.

Description:

SCP-2748 is a male monkey, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall. It is most notable for the red beanie it wears atop its head, and the jade earring it sports in its right ear. SCP-2748 carries a whistle on its person at all times, and its eyes are unknown due to the size of its beanie.

The personality of SCP-2748 is one that is reminiscent of the monkey's love for impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors. SCP-2748 has been known to engage in behaviors that may be considered dangerous or foolish by others, such as jumping from high places or swimming in strong currents.

When contained, SCP-2748 shows a great affinity for climbing and exploring its containment chamber. It is most content when it is physically engaged, and displays signs of agitation when forced to remain still for prolonged periods of time.

SCP-2748 currently works as a theater manager, where its self-starter personality and love of entertainment make it an invaluable asset to the establishment. However, it is to be noted that SCP-2748's behavior can be unpredictable, and caution must be maintained at all times.
