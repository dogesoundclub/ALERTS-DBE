SCP Foundation Description:

Item #: SCP-3566

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3566 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Any requests made by SCP-3566 are to be reviewed and approved by at least two Level-3 personnel. A pack of cigarettes is to be provided to SCP-3566 upon request, and she must not be denied access to them.

Description: SCP-3566 is a human female with green hair that has a curl at the edge. She has orange stripes on her face, and green cross earrings on her ears. SCP-3566 identifies herself as a theater manager and possesses a deep understanding of theatre arts. She also smokes cigarettes frequently and refuses to quit.

SCP-3566 has a strong sense of independence and is often reluctant to ask for assistance. This can result in amusing situations, such as her attempting to move a heavy piece of furniture by herself or stubbornly refusing to use a map when lost. Despite her stubborn nature, SCP-3566 is a kind individual and can be reasonable in negotiations.

Addendum: In ██/██/20██, SCP-3566 requested a surface view of the outside world for a play that she is putting on. After reviewing her request, approval was granted, and SCP-3566 was escorted to a nearby rooftop for her viewing pleasure. After six hours of being on the rooftop, SCP-3566 requested to return to her cell, citing a lack of inspiration. Upon inspection of the rooftop, agents found no signs of any materials taken or equipment damaged. SCP-3566's motives remain unknown.
