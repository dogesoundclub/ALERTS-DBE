Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Item #747, identified as a male Rabbit Mechanic, is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Proper veterinary care should be provided to keep the item in good physical condition.

Under no circumstances should Item #747 be allowed access to any kind of engine, electronic, mechanical or otherwise, as they have shown an unexplained ability to disassemble and reassemble said machinery at an alarming rate. Any and all tools or blueprints found in the vicinity of Item #747 are to be securely confiscated and analyzed for any possible anomalous properties.

Description: Item #747 stands approximately 75cm in height and weighs approximately 6.8kg. Their most distinguishing feature are the horn-rimmed glasses over their eyes and a police cap on their head. Item #747 also wears a red scarf and carries a whistle as their accessories.

Item #747's personality is that of a highly intelligent and curious individual. They have an insatiable thirst for knowledge that drives them to read and research obscure topics for days on end. Their curiosity extends to the mechanical realm, as they possess an innate understanding of machines that defies explanation.

Item #747's anomalous effect is the ability to disassemble and reassemble mechanical objects with incredible speed and precision. The extent of this ability is not fully understood, but it is known to include dismantling even the most complex machinery with little effort. Item #747 has been observed taking apart cars, airplanes, and even weaponry with ease, hence its special containment procedures.

Addendum: Item #747 has shown no signs of aggression or hostility towards staff, making it a low threat to Foundation personnel. Its insatiable curiosity and mechanical abilities make it an asset to the Foundation, and proposals for research into its abilities are currently being considered.
