Item #: 5209

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5209 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. As SCP-5209's existence is common knowledge, no additional measures are necessary to prevent interaction with others.

Description: SCP-5209 is a human male identified as a veterinarian. Despite its physical appearance, SCP-5209 possesses no anomalous abilities or properties. SCP-5209's physical mutations primarily affect facial features, including a mouth spot and clown mouth, accompanied by red clown eyes.

SCP-5209's anomaly is mostly aesthetic and does not pose a threat to Foundation operations. As SCP-5209 operates in human society, it wears a medical mask to cover its clown mouth and goggles on its forehead, which it claims are merely a stylistic choice.

SCP-5209's empathy and compassion are traits that are exceptionally pronounced, and it endeavors to alleviate the suffering of all sentient beings, exhibiting what the Foundation deems as admirable but exhausting behavior.

Addendum 5209-01: A search of SCP-5209's residence revealed a gold chain with no anomalous properties, but its significance was unknown. SCP-5209 later voluntarily reported that it was a family heirloom and held personal value to him.

Addendum 5209-02: With the rise of anomalous animal phenomena, SCP-5209 has been authorized to collaborate with the Foundation in veterinary care for anomalous animals. SCP-5209's expertise and passion for animal welfare make it an invaluable asset in protecting anomalous creatures from abuse and neglect.
