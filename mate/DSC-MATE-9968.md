Item #: 9968

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9968 is to be monitored at all times and is not to leave the designated area without clearance from a senior researcher. Any attempts by 9968 to interfere with the personal lives of others must be immediately reported and documented.

Description: Subject 9968 is a female human of average height and weight. The most distinctive feature of 9968's appearance is the orange stripes present on their face, accompanied by purple lipstick. Their eyes are obscured behind a pair of plain glasses, and they wear a purple cap with a headset, a gold chain, and are usually seen smoking a cigarette.

While subject 9968 may appear unremarkable at first glance, they possess an unnerving ability to empathize and connect with others. In many cases, their compassion has led them to involve themselves in the personal lives of those around them, often attempting to fix their problems at their own expense.

Subject 9968's personality is dualistic, as their empathetic nature is juxtaposed by a tendency towards compulsive behavior. They often feel obligated to solve issues, even those outside of their control, leading to feelings of exhaustion and burnout.

It is unknown if 9968's abilities are a result of a supernatural or anomalous source.

Additional Notes: Subject 9968's tendency towards impulsive behavior and deep-rooted need to help others makes them unsuitable for field work or any activity involving direct contact with civilians.
