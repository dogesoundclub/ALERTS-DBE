Special Containment Procedures: Subject 3398 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. Access to any electronic devices must be strictly monitored and subject to approval by at least Level 2 personnel. Direct contact with Subject 3398 is prohibited without the usage of the provided gas mask. Any personnel making contact with the subject must undergo psychiatric evaluation and observation for any behavioral changes for a minimum period of one week. 

Description: Subject 3398 is a male human of unknown age and origin. The subject is distinguished by its orange striped facial features, adorned with a purple cap with a headset on top of the head, red victory band on the forehead, and goggles on the forehead. The subject's red clown eyes and jade earring are additional features. Subject 3398 is referred to as a "programmer" which is suspected to be a cover name for the activities it performs. 

Subject 3398 has displayed traits of valuing tradition, and a no-nonsense attitude. However, it also displays a playful and humorous side, often telling jokes and stories that have been passed down through their community. The subject's personality suggests a possible association with a group of interest, yet its true affiliation remains unknown. 

Addendum 3398-1: On ██/██/20██, Subject 3398 was discovered in a nearby neighborhood practicing several forms of mixed martial arts without anyone present. When approached by agents, the subject immediately attempted to engage them in mock combat but was subdued and contained in a Foundation facility. It has been determined that the behavioral patterns exhibited by the subject are not consistent with any known human condition. Investigation and monitoring are ongoing. 

Addendum 3398-2: On the ██/██/20██, Subject 3398 was found attempting to escape while using its programming skills in an attempt to override the facility's security systems. The attempt failed, and the subject was detained. No disciplinary action was taken due to its demonstrated abilities that may prove useful in future Foundation projects. 

Addendum 3398-3: Further investigation revealed that Subject 3398 is involved in a group of interest known as the "Jester's Troop," a group of individuals associated with various anomalous objects and activities. Communication attempts with the subject regarding its influence within the group have been unsuccessful.
