Item #: 2794

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2794 is to be monitored at all times to ensure its compliance with Foundation regulations. Should any deviation from normal human behavior be observed, SCP-2794 is to be immediately detained for further evaluation. SCP-2794 is to be treated with dignity and respect at all times.

Description: SCP-2794 is a male human of average height and build. Despite being a creature of organic makeup, SCP-2794 possesses several anomalous physical features. Notable traits include a mouth spot located on the lower left-hand corner of its face, ski goggle-shaped eyes and a police cap atop its head. SCP-2794 is often seen wearing a red scarf or other similar accessories.

SCP-2794 has an innate talent for leadership, displaying the ability to take charge of situations without prompting. This trait is evident both at work and in social settings, as well as in SCP-2794's personal life. While not overtly aggressive, SCP-2794's commanding presence often comes at the expense of others.

SCP-2794's profession as an electrician allows it a reasonable degree of anonymity in the outside world, though its anomalous traits have resulted in some social ostracization. Despite this, SCP-2794 appears to be fully integrated into human society and poses no significant threat to it.

Addendum: SCP-2794 has expressed an interest in joining Foundation personnel. While the Foundation acknowledges SCP-2794's potential as a useful asset, its anomalous traits make it ineligible for recruitment. SCP-2794 has been advised to pursue employment opportunities outside the Foundation.
