Item #: SCP-7636

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7636 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located within Site-██. The containment chamber is to be equipped with a microphone and soundproofing material to allow for secure interviews with SCP-7636. All information obtained from SCP-7636 should be considered classified and handled in accordance with Level 3 clearance protocols.

Description: SCP-7636 appears to be a male rabbit, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height, and weighing 30 kilograms. SCP-7636 exhibits a frightened mouth, which is believed to be a permanent expression assumed to indicate his unwillingness to communicate with outsiders. SCP-7636 wears glasses, a police cap, and a red scarf as his primary accessories. SCP-7636 also wears two fashionable bands across his forehead and a gold earring on his right ear. Additionally, SCP-7636 also appears to be carrying a candy stick within his mouth at all times.

SCP-7636 displays a love for debate and has a knack for critical thinking, which is often seen in his job as a news anchor. SCP-7636's quick wit and humor, when combined with his playful arguments with friends and family members, make him a likeable and entertaining figure. SCP-7636 often appears to welcome friends and acquaintances into his living space, which is rather messy but reflects his creative mind.

Addendum: Due to SCP-7636's traits that may prove to be challenging to contain, it is recommended that research be conducted to determine the extent of his anomalous properties. SCP-7636's potential knowledge of Foundation activities and ability to adhere to Foundation protocols should also be evaluated.
