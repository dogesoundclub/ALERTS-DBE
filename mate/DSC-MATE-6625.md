Item #: 6625

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 6625 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The individual is allowed accessories such as red beanie, nerd glasses and a gas mask, but any changes to these must be approved by Site Director. Subject must not be allowed access to any potentially dangerous objects. Additionally, any materials the individual acquires must be screened by security personnel before they can be given to him. 

Description: 

Subject 6625 appears to be a human male in his late thirties, with a nerdy appearance accentuated by his identifiable glasses and red beanie. The individual displays a distinctive feature of a pair of goggles adorning his forehead. He is clad with a red scarf and a normal gas mask, possibly to avoid inhalation of any contaminants. 

Personality-wise, Subject 6625 is energetic and enthusiastic. He has frequently been observed trying to excite others about his interests--sometimes exceedingly so. These conversations often turn eccentric and passionate, which can be amusing for some but off-putting for others. 

It is to be noted that Subject 6625 is a Real Estate Agent by profession, and this occupation could be a cover for his anomalous properties. The reason for 6625's peculiarities and interests is not currently known, and ongoing investigation is necessary to determine if any further measures need to be taken. 

Addendum:

6625 has shown his ability to manipulate the housing market by way of his intense and enthusiastic personality. His work has led to a significant rise in housing prices in certain areas, rendering the purchase of many properties out of reach for the average person. It is still unknown if the individual has additional anomalies in his abilities.
