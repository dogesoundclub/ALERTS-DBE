Item #7087: "Donny the Don"

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Item #7087 is to be contained at all times within a reinforced steel box surrounded by three layers of electrified fencing. All personnel assigned to guard duty must carry an emergency supply of carrots and lettuce to offer as bribes to prevent incursion attempts.

Description: Item #7087 is a male rabbit identified as "Donny the Don," the notorious boss of a Mafia gang that originated in the underground cities of New York. Standing at two feet tall, Item #7087 is characterized by a frightened mouth and a police cap. Its forehead features a two-color band and a goggle, further accessorized by Jade earrings, a red scarf, and a whistle.

Despite its diminutive size, Item #7087 is a feared leader, commanding a ruthless network of thugs and hitmen. Its charming personality is highlighted by an excellent sense of humor, which it uses to endear itself to both its underlings and its enemies. The subject is known for its comic timing and its love of practical jokes, which it uses as a tool to exploit others and lighten the mood in tense situations.

While Item #7087 is generally genial and approachable, its power-hungry nature and fierce loyalty to its organization could quickly shift its behavior towards one of aggression and ruthlessness. Its propensity for violence and bloodshed may have contributed to its long reign as the top crime boss of the underworld.

Addendum: Preliminary psychological profiling shows that Item #7087 has a fragile ego and a tendency towards paranoid behavior, commonly using humor as a defense mechanism to deflect any criticism or questioning. Agents are advised to tread carefully when dealing with the subject, as any perceived disrespect or challenge may trigger extreme defensiveness and violence.
