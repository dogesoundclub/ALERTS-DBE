DSC FILE 6101: "THE MISCHIEVOUS PROGRAMMER"

DESCRIPTION:
DSC-MATE-6101 appears to be a male monkey with distinctive accessories such as a gold chain, a gold earring, and horn-rimmed glasses. Its head is green and not arranged in the typical symmetry of a normal monkey. DSC-MATE-6101 is usually seen smoking a cigarette, which it appears to have fashioned from materials it had found within the containment area. Its eyes are hidden behind the glasses, giving the impression of an intelligent being observing its environment.

PERSONALITY:
DSC-MATE-6101 exhibits a rebellious personality, with a strong sense of independence that can lead to disobedience towards perceived unnecessary rules or authority. Due to this personality trait, DSC-MATE-6101 has been known to sneak out of its containment area early on occasions or take unauthorized days off.

CONTAINMENT:
DSC-MATE-6101 must be contained within a designated cell, which is to be secured with reinforced steel doors and camera surveillance. Access to this area is only allowed to authorized personnel. The containment area must also be cleaned and monitored regularly for DSC-MATE-6101's creations or potential escape plans. All objects in its cell are to be assessed, and any items that may be useful for escape purposes are removed.

It is recommended to keep DSC-MATE-6101 occupied and content within its cell with regular interaction with researchers.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
DSC-MATE-6101's intelligence and programming skills are being investigated. As such, there may be potential opportunities to integrate DSC-MATE-6101's talent into the Foundation's endeavors. However, caution is strongly advised when working with DSC-MATE-6101 due to its rebellious tendencies and potential for sabotage or escape attempts.
