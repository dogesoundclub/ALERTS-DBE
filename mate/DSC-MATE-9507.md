Item #: 9507

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: DSC-MATE-9507 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. DSC-MATE-9507 is permitted access to the facility’s cafeteria for meal times. DSC-MATE-9507 may wear its Doge hat and gold chain during its stay in captivity, but is not permitted to leave the containment chamber while wearing it.

Description: DSC-MATE-9507 appears to be a male monkey, standing at approximately 1.2 meters in height. Its primary facial feature is a frightened mouth, expressing consistent vocalizations of discomfort, mostly around personnel. DSC-MATE-9507 possesses blue clown eyes, which, on occasion, appear to change in color, but this is yet to be confirmed. DSC-MATE-9507 is also seen wearing a Doge hat and a gold chain as accessories. DSC-MATE-9507's personality is consistently consistent; he seems to be a laid-back and easy-going individual who can quickly become both fiercely loyal and protective of loved ones. DSC-MATE-9507's character can be quite humorous, spiking heated arguments with anyone who insults his friends or family.

Addendum 9507-1:

One of Site-██'s NPCs (Non-Personnel Characters) recognized DSC-MATE-9507 while it was working for a well-known fast-food organization. MTF Eta-10 “Damn Feds” was dispatched to neutralize witnesses and bring DSC-MATE-9507 into Foundation custody. DSC-MATE-9507 was cooperative and released willingly, though its gold chain was confiscated.

DSC-MATE-9507 has proven to be a valuable asset to Foundation staff while wandering the site, often lending a helping hand to researchers in need. Recently, DSC-MATE-9507 managed to transport a number of smaller DSCs out of harm's way during a containment breach without any directives. DSC-MATE-9507 is currently awaiting a transfer request to a Foundation facility which requires DSCs to do task work.
