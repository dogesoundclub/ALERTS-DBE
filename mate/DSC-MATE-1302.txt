Item #: 1302

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1302 is to be kept in a standard human containment cell, with no access to car dealership facilities. Any attempts at selling vehicles are to be immediately reported to Site Director, and any potential customers are to be redirected to non-anomalous car salesmen.

Description: SCP-1302 is a female human with distinctive orange stripes on her face and purple lips. She has red clown eyes and her blonde hair features a wing. SCP-1302 wears goggles on her forehead, gold earrings, and a gold chain around her neck. She is a car salesman by profession and has displayed some anomalous abilities in salesmanship. Her personality is highly organized and reliable, but also stubborn and resistant to change.

SCP-1302's anomalous properties manifest in her ability to persuade individuals to purchase vehicles from her dealership, often using techniques that are highly illogical and compelling. She has been observed manipulating the emotions of potential customers to make a sale, and has the ability to disorient them with her clown-like appearance, allowing her to close deals more efficiently.

Addendum: SCP-1302's anomalous effect has been observed to only hold sway over those with weak willpower, those suffering from mental conditions, and those who are easily impressionable. For this reason, buying a car from SCP-1302 is highly discouraged, and all measures must be taken to avoid interaction with her. Any personnel displaying susceptibility to SCP-1302's abilities are to immediately undergo amnestic treatment.
