Addendum 3393-1: Incident Report

On ██/██/20██, SCP-3393 displayed an unusual behavior while performing its daily chores. It was observed frantically digging the ground around the farm, muttering incomprehensible phrases under its breath. When approached by Foundation personnel, SCP-3393 became aggressive and began throwing farm tools at them.

After a brief altercation, SCP-3393 calmed down and explained that it had found a strange object buried in the ground. Further investigation led to the discovery of an anomalous artifact, designated SCP-████, which caused SCP-3393's behavior. SCP-████ was immediately secured and SCP-3393 was administered Class-C amnestics.

Further investigation into SCP-3393's past and abilities is ongoing.
