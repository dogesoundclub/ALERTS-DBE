Addendum: SCP-4634 will be required to undergo frequent psychological evaluations to monitor its mental state and prevent any impulsive behavior that could endanger its safety or the safety of others. Any changes, sign of instability or aggressive behavior, or major fluctuations in behavior must be reported to the Site Director immediately.
