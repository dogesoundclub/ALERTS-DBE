Item #: SCP-3404

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3404 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. Personnel are advised to exercise caution when interacting with SCP-3404 due to the object’s anomalous properties. Any instances of SCP-3404-A are to be contained, amnesticized, and released into the wild.

Description: SCP-3404 is a male rabbit of an unknown subspecies. SCP-3404 possesses blue clown-like eyes and is observed to wear a retro cap with a gold earring attached to each ear. SCP-3404 also wears a silver chain and a normal gas mask, which are reported to help contain the object’s anomalous properties.

SCP-3404 displays a unique ability, recently designated SCP-3404-A. When SCP-3404 is tasked with organizing a group project, it will effectively delegate tasks to its or any unoccupied SCP-3404-A, creating an efficient and near-perfect working environment. SCP-3404-A instances are visually identical to SCP-3404, but lack the object’s anomalous properties.

SCP-3404’s personality is characterized as being very organized and efficient. SCP-3404 displays an overbearing nature, and as such, tends to come across as a controlling individual. Despite SCP-3404’s proclivity towards over-organizing, humorous situations result when SCP-3404 impromptu delegates tasks in a seemingly matter-of-fact way.

Addendum: The Foundation was alerted to SCP-3404’s anomalous properties when a local beautician operating a beauty parlor in ████, was reported to the police by concerned customers for controlling and micromanaging everyone in his shop. Further investigation by the Foundation revealed the proprietor to be SCP-3404. The owner was apprehended and taken to Foundation custody, where the object’s abilities were contained.
