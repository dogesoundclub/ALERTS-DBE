Item #: SCP-6662

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6662 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel are not to directly view SCP-6662's face without proper Level 3 clearance and approval from at least two senior researchers. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to avoid direct contact with SCP-6662.

Description: SCP-6662 appears to be a human male of average height and build. Notably, SCP-6662's face is adorned with orange stripes, possibly indicating a connection to an anomalous entity. SCP-6662's head is covered by a retro cap, and a pair of goggles rest on their forehead. SCP-6662 wears a green cross earring, a medical mask over their mouth, and a gold chain around their neck.

SCP-6662 is employed as a car salesman in the city of [REDACTED], where they make use of their hands-on, practical nature to fix cars in unusual ways. Their sales pitches often include mentions of "rare and exotic" modifications to potential customers.

Though SCP-6662 is cooperative with Foundation personnel, they have not shown any indication of understanding their anomalous nature. Research is ongoing to determine the source of SCP-6662's anomalous abilities.

Addendum: Following Incident 6662-A, in which SCP-6662 accessed restricted Foundation information via a security breach, SCP-6662's clearance level has been downgraded to Level 2. All inquiries from SCP-6662 are to be monitored by at least one Foundation staff member with Level 3 clearance.
