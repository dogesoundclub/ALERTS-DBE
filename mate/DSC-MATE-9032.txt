Item #: 9032

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 9032 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to the subject is only to be granted to authorized personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any attempts by the subject to leave their cell should be met with immediate termination.

Description: Subject 9032 is a human male with spots covering their face as their distinguishing feature. He is often seen wearing a bucket hat with a pair of goggles resting on his forehead. Additionally, he wears a jade earring, a gold chain and often carries a cigarette. While seemingly innocuous, it is important to note that the subject has an exceptional attention to detail and is a skilled programmer.

Personality: Subject 9032 is known to be extremely observant and gifted in the art of finding the perfect gift for anyone. However, this attention to detail can manifest as an obsessive tendency to fixate on finding the perfect gift, to the detriment of other areas of their life. As such, the subject should be monitored closely for signs of obsessive behavior that may lead to volatile outbursts.

Further research indicates that Subject 9032 may potentially possess anomalous properties that require additional study. Until further notice, any and all interaction with the subject should be handled with utmost caution.
