SCP-4495 is a humanoid being identified as a lawyer, classified as a Neutralized Entity after a brief but explosive encounter with Foundation agents. Despite being human in nature, their physical appearance is anything but ordinary. SCP-4495 is adorned with orange stripes that run across their face, highlighted by a mohawk upon their head. Their ears are pierced with a single gold earring, and around their neck rests a thick gold chain. However, the most notable feature of SCP-4495 is their insatiable habit of smoking, which they seem to constantly be indulging in.

But don't let their flamboyant appearance fool you- SCP-4495 is a serious being when it comes to their job. Well-versed in the legal language and procedures, they have a sharp wit and a silver tongue that often get them out of trouble, both in and out of the courtroom. However, their absentmindedness has led to some humorous predicaments, such as missing important appointments and losing important paperwork.

Perhaps this forgetfulness is a result of SCP-4495 being lost in thought. They are always working on some project or another, and their mind dances with ideas and possibilities. However, this has caused them to occasionally overlook important details, which has been problematic for the Foundation in the past.

Efforts to contain SCP-4495 have proven to be futile, and after their encounter with Foundation agents, they disappeared from the public eye without a trace. Now, considered Neutralized, it is unknown where they are or what they may be working on.
