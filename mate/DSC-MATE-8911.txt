Item #: SCP-8911

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8911 is to be contained at Site-██ and is to be monitored at all times by two armed guards. All personnel are required to wear a medical mask when conversing with SCP-8911 to prevent any potential contamination. SCP-8911 is only to be released from containment for the purpose of filming news broadcasts.

Description: SCP-8911 appears to be a male human in his mid-30s with blue clown eyes and a frightened mouth. He is often seen wearing a short peak cap with a 2 color band on his forehead, a medical mask covering his mouth, and a jade earring in his left ear. He also wears a gold chain around his neck.

SCP-8911's anomalous effects manifest in his absent-minded and forgetful demeanor, particularly when lost in thought or working on a project. Such forgetfulness can lead to humorous situations, including missing appointments or losing track of time and missing important events. However, the severity of this effect is not fully understood, as SCP-8911 has exhibited possible cognitive alterations in those who come into close proximity with him.

SCP-8911's profession as a news anchor has brought him into close contact with numerous individuals, raising concerns regarding potential widespread cognitive effects. Investigation into this possibility is ongoing.

Addendum: Due to the potential risks associated with SCP-8911's anomalous effects, O5 Council has approved the implementation of a new budget allocation requesting research funding to investigate a possible amnestics-based solution to neutralize SCP-8911's effects.
