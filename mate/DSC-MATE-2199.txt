Item #: 2199

Object Class: Euclid

Description: SCP-2199 appears to be a typical human, a female banker with a dazzling smile. However, she possesses unique traits that have never been observed in any human before. SCP-2199's eyes are LED screens that glow in VR jade, making it difficult for others to maintain eye contact with her. She has a head covered in a rainbow festival hat, indicating a flamboyant personality. Additionally, SCP-2199 wears green cross earrings and a silver chain.

Personality: SCP-2199 is a compassionate and empathetic individual whose nature can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Her ability to sense and perceive the emotions of others is extraordinary, but it leads to her taking on others' problems as her own. SCP-2199 bears a significant burden of responsibility on her shoulders, trying to fix everyone's issues around her. Her behavior can be admirable, but it tires her quickly.

Containment Procedures: SCP-2199 has been housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, and strict security measures for the protection of her eyes have been implemented. Personnel must not maintain eye contact with SCP-2199 for more than ten seconds to refrain from the risk of hypnosis. She is authorized to smoke at designated times and places only. SCP-2199 has been authorized to access financial data and reports pertinent to her job solely. All bank workers who come in contact with her must undergo psychological tests weekly.

Addendum: Dr. ████████ recommends terminating SCP-2199 due to the risk it poses. However, the O5 council has decided unanimously to keep SCP-2199 contained due to her potential as an essential asset for the foundation in the future. The council also calls for additional measures to be implemented to mitigate SCP-2199's risks.
