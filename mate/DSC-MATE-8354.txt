Item #: 8354

Object Class: Anomalous

Job: Beautician

Species: Panthera tigris (Tiger)

Gender: Male

Containment Procedures: SCP-8354 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Access to mirrors and hair care products must be limited to prevent the entity from utilizing its anomalous properties. Personnel are reminded to maintain a safe distance and exercise caution when interacting with SCP-8354 due to its unpredictable behavior.

Description: SCP-8354 is a sentient tiger that appears to be a humanoid wearing horned rim glasses, a blue bandana on its head, and a goggle on its forehead. It is often found wearing a silver chain and smoking a cigarette. It is capable of communicating in English, Spanish, and French.

SCP-8354 has anomalous properties that enable it to manipulate hair growth and appearance. Upon coming into contact with a subject's hair, the entity's hands emit a bright blue light that stimulates accelerated hair growth, allowing SCP-8354 to style and manipulate hair in a unique, often flamboyant and eccentric manner.

SCP-8354 has demonstrated a playful and mischievous personality, often engaging in harmless pranks and joking around with personnel. It enjoys brainstorming and coming up with new and creative ideas, which can lead to some humorous situations, such as suggesting outlandish solutions to problems just to see how others react. It is important to note that this entity can become agitated or even aggressive if its abilities are challenged or its freedom is restricted.

Addendum: SCP-8354 was recovered from a salon in Paris, France, where it was operating as a beautician under the guise of a human. The entity's anomalous abilities were discovered after multiple complaints from customers of rapid hair growth and strange haircuts. Following containment and investigation, it was discovered that SCP-8354 had been in operation for over 5 years, posing as a human beautician while experimenting with its anomalous abilities. All affected customers were administered amnestics.

SCP-8354 has expressed interest in working cooperatively with the Foundation, provided it is allowed to continue using its anomalous abilities for hair styling purposes. Although this is not a possibility, its containment has since been relaxed, and personnel have been instructed to foster healthy conversation with the entity to maintain its morale.
