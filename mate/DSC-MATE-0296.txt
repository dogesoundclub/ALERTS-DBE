Item #: SCP-296

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-296 is to be monitored at all times while on duty as a train driver. Their daily routine is to be strictly observed, and any unusual behavior must be reported immediately to the Site Director. SCP-296 may wear their LED Gas Mask while on duty, and permission to remove the mask must always be granted by Site personnel.

Description: SCP-296 is a human female with orange stripes on their face, accompanied by a warm smile. They have distinct orange eyebrows and short hair styled in a "witch" cut. SCP-296 wears a red cross earring on one ear and a gold chain around their neck. They also wear an LED gas mask as a form of personal protective equipment.

SCP-296 displays a deep empathy and understanding for others, frequently moved to tears or emotional outbursts when they witness someone else's pain or suffering. They have a fondness for animals and nature and often spend their free time volunteering in animal shelters or community gardens.

SCP-296's anomalous ability is unknown at this time, but their suitability for day-to-day operations as a train driver aids in keeping their anomalous nature discreet. SCP-296 poses no apparent risk to site security at present.

Addendum: Due to SCP-296's positive demeanor and empathic qualities, Site Director [Redacted] has deemed it appropriate for SCP-296 to be granted a higher level of freedom when carrying out their duties. SCP-296 is now authorized to provide emotional support to personnel who may be struggling with personal or work-related issues. As such, SCP-296 has been assigned the additional role of an emotional support agent to assist fellow SCP Foundation employees.
