Item #: 475

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-475 is to be monitored at all times under the guise of her normal job as a delivery driver. Any deviation from her daily routine is to be reported immediately. Access to SCP-475 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above.

Description: SCP-475, a human female, has two distinct facial features, including spots on her cheeks and a purple lip. Her eyes are obscured by nondescript glasses, and she wears a pink rabbit head with green cross earrings attached to the ears. SCP-475 wears a medical mask at all times, making communication difficult. Despite this, she displays a strong sense of independence, often refusing help and insisting on doing things herself. 

SCP-475's origin is currently unknown, but she has been identified as a delivery driver for a local company. Her employer has been covertly informed of her anomalous nature and instructed to monitor her behavior. SCP-475 is not known to possess any abnormal abilities or powers, but her stubbornness and refusal to use aids like maps may lead her into dangerous or inappropriate situations.
