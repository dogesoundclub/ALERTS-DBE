Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3460 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with access to medical equipment and tools for their profession as a doctor. SCP-3460 is allowed to wear their LED gas mask at all times to maintain their mental and emotional stability. Any injuries or illnesses they incur are to be treated immediately by a medical professional, with surveillance of their recovery process to ensure no anomalous activity arises.

Description: SCP-3460 is a male tiger humanoid, standing at approximately 1.8 meters in height. They possess the physical features of a tiger, including fur that ranges from orange to white and distinctive stripes. SCP-3460 wears normal glasses, which tend to slip down their snout due to their frightened mouth. Their head is not arranged in a proper hairstyle, giving off an unkempt appearance, and they wear a red victory band on their forehead. SCP-3460 also wears a jade earring on their right ear.

SCP-3460's personality is practical and hands-on, often fixing objects and problems in unconventional ways. They rely on their ingenuity and resourcefulness to create solutions, using items such as duct tape and paperclips. SCP-3460's most notable accessory is their LED gas mask, which emits various colors and patterns while in use. It is believed that the mask assists in maintaining SCP-3460's emotional and mental state.

Addendum 3460-1:

SCP-3460 was discovered in a small town in rural Minnesota, where they were working as a doctor at a local medical clinic. Reports of anomalous activity in the area led to Foundation intervention, and SCP-3460 was contained with little resistance. During initial interviews, SCP-3460 claimed to have no knowledge of their anomalous properties or how they obtained their tiger form. They have shown a willingness to cooperate with Foundation agents and have expressed a desire to assist in medical research.

Note: SCP-3460's unconventional problem-solving skills may prove useful in future containment and research efforts. As such, they are a valuable asset to the Foundation.
