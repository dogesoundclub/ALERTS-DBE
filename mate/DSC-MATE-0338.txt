Item #: SCP-338

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-338 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. Access to SCP-338 is granted only to personnel with Level 2 or higher security clearance. SCP-338's medical experience makes it an essential resource for the Foundation's veterinarian team, but interactions must be closely monitored.

Description: SCP-338 appears to be an adult male of the Homo sapiens species with the following distinctive traits: orange stripes on the face, ski goggle eyes, parted pink hair, gold earring in the ears, and a medical mask covering the mouth. SCP-338 is known to wear a red scarf as accessories.

SCP-338's personality is characterized by an ambitious and goal-oriented nature, displaying excellent organizational skills and strategic thinking. However, SCP-338 has a tendency to take on more than it can handle, which can cause issues. SCP-338's medical background proves useful to researchers and the veterinarian team, but the Foundation must always keep an eye on SCP-338, as testing its limits could prove to be dangerous.

Addendum: SCP-338 has expressed a desire to work with anomalous creatures in the Foundation's care, which should be considered for future feasibility studies. Until further notice, SCP-338 is expected to remain within containment.
