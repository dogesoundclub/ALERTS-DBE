Item #: 4244

Object Class: Feline Anomalous Object

Special Containment Procedures: Subject 4244 is to be housed in a secure facility on the outskirts of the city. A specialized security team equipped with tranquilizers is to monitor 4244's location at all times. Handlers are advised to approach 4244 with caution, as it has exhibited unpredictable behaviors while taking risks.

Description: Subject 4244 is a male Siberian tiger measuring six feet in length and weighing approximately 400 pounds. It displays evidence of human-like tendencies such as wearing nerd glasses, a bucket hat, a jade earring, a medical mask, and a gold chain. Despite having undergone no discernible mutations, it possesses unheard-of abilities to understand human language and complete human-dexterity tasks.

Personality: 4244 has demonstrated a love for adventure, taking risks, and trying new things. This behavior translates to its interactions with humans as it may attempt to engage in unusual conversational topics or games of chance. These tendencies have led to humorous stories of 4244's love for danger, such as surviving a near-death experience while bungee jumping or accidentally getting lost in the wilderness.

Addendum: During a routine observation, a test of 4244's abilities to comprehend instructions was conducted. 4244 successfully retrieved a thrown object and returned the object to the handler's hand by recognizing hand gestures, and even understood directives given in partial Spanish. Investigation into these abilities is currently underway.
