DSC-MATE-9950 exhibits a natural charm and charisma that can make her the life of the party. She often tells jokes and performs silly dances to make others laugh. DSC-MATE-9950 is also capable of anomalous abilities that allow her to influence human emotions. She can make people feel happy or sad, angry or calm, based on her desired outcome. Some DSC researchers have speculated that her anomalous abilities may be linked to her purple lip coloration and orange eyebrows.

DSC-MATE-9950 has not shown to be aggressive, but testing must be done to verify if her abilities can be used for malicious purposes. DSC-MATE-9950 has expressed no knowledge or understanding of her abilities, and she has only been made aware of her containment due to a recent breach.

Addendum: DSC-MATE-9950 was found after reports of an "unusually happy" train ride. DSC agents were dispatched and found DSC-MATE-9950 acting jovially towards passengers. Upon initial questioning, DSC-MATE-9950 was unaware of her anomalous abilities. Further testing is required to determine the full extent of DSC-MATE-9950's abilities.
