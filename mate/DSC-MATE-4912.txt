Item #: 4912

Object Class: Safe

Description: SCP-4912 is a human female with distinct physical features. The subject possesses orange stripes on their face that run down from their hairline to their chin. They also have a wide, genuine smile that has been observed to be contagious to those around them. Additionally, SCP-4912's eyes have orange eyebrows, giving them a unique and striking appearance.

SCP-4912's head is predominantly blonde, with an enigmatic wing-shaped protrusion located on the nape of their neck. Although this feature has been examined numerous times, the Foundation's research team has been unable to determine its origin or purpose.

The subject's ears are adorned with a pair of intricately designed jade earrings. They also wear a black choker around their neck and can often be seen with a lit cigarette in their hand.

SCP-4912 has demonstrated a tendency to be easily distracted, forgetful and disorganized in their duties as a Foundation security guard. This has resulted in several comical incidents, including missing important appointments, getting lost while on patrol, and misplacing critical documents.

Despite their forgetfulness, SCP-4912 has proven to be a trustworthy individual with a strong sense of loyalty to the Foundation's mission. They have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their role, albeit with occasional lapses in concentration.

SCP-4912 is currently assigned to Site-██, where they are responsible for ensuring the security of the facility and its personnel. They are to be monitored closely for any signs of anomalous behavior. Any deviation from accepted protocol should be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately.
