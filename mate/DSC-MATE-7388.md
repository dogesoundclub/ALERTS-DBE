Description: DSC-MATE-7388 is a human male with distinctive spots on their face, and a perpetually friendly smile. The subject's eyes are covered by a pair of ski goggles, and they wear their hair in a mohawk style. DSC-MATE-7388 is often seen wearing a silver chain around their neck.

DSC-MATE-7388 possesses a natural charm and charisma that is highly infectious to those around them. Their affable nature is often the life of the party, and they are quick to tell jokes or do silly dances to make others laugh. However, DSC-MATE-7388's charm can also be used to manipulate individuals, making them highly unpredictable.

DSC-MATE-7388's previous occupation as a train driver is of note, as it suggests a highly structured and ordered mindset. However, their current containment has resulted in increased agitation and restlessness, and the subject must be closely monitored for any signs of aggression or escape attempts.

Addendum: Testing has shown that DSC-MATE-7388 has the ability to hypnotize individuals that come into direct eye contact with them while wearing their ski goggles. Further research is required to determine the full extent of this ability, and any potential applications for containment or interrogation purposes.
