Item #: SCP-6207

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6207 is to be kept under surveillance at all times and is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with all necessary amenities. Personnel are to treat SCP-6207 with caution and respect, and all interactions must be kept professional.

Description: SCP-6207 is a female human, aged 35, who works as a theater manager. Her facial features include multiple dark spots on her skin and bright red lips, accompanied by orange eyebrows. Her head is not arranged properly and is a green color. Her forehead has two different colored bands on it. She has gold earrings and a gold chain as accessories.

SCP-6207 is often seen wearing a gas mask, although this does not seem to affect her breathing or oxygen supply. Personality-wise, SCP-6207 is fiercely independent and refuses to ask for help, even when it is required. This has led to humorous situations in the past, such as attempting to move heavy objects by herself or refusing to use a map when lost.

Given SCP-6207's unusual physical characteristics, her true nature is currently under investigation. However, it is currently believed that SCP-6207 is a regular human with no anomalous abilities or properties.

Addendum: It has been noted that SCP-6207 possesses a remarkable talent for theatre management, with her productions consistently receiving critical acclaim. As such, Foundation personnel may consider enlisting her expertise for future Foundation galas or events.
