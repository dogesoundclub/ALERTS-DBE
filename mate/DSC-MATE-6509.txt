OBJECT CLASS: Safe

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Subject 6509, also known as "Officer Chimp," is to be assigned to urban areas where he is best suited for his role as a traffic officer. Where possible, his assigned area should be within a neighborhood where he is familiar with surroundings and populace, keeping his anxiety levels down.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-6509 is a male monkey, a member of the Cercopithecidae family, measuring approximately 3 feet tall, and weighing 70 pounds. He bears a Police Cap on his head, with a gold earring on each ear, and a pair of nerd glasses. SCP-6509 has a frightened mouth. Despite his genetically different appearance, he exhibits human-like behavior, with a significant empathy and understanding for others. He has shown great concern and compassion for the people he serves and the animals in his environment.

SCP-6509's condition makes him susceptible to overstimulation, leading to emotional outbursts, and paves the way for cognitive and emotional difficulties that can affect his role as a traffic officer. In addition, he has a deep fondness for nature and animals, making his bond with nature an essential factor in keeping him healthy and psychologically stable.

The incident involving the rescue of a kitten, where SCP-6509 exhibited bravery while disregarding his fears, was the highlight of his performance. SCP-6509's fascination with animals such as dogs, and his ability to calm them during stressful situations, make him an exemplary asset to the city. However, his emotional vulnerability is a considerable factor that must always be taken into account, as it may negatively affect his performance or expose him to security breaches.
