Item #: SCP-1798

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1798 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a security camera installed on the ceiling for surveillance. SCP-1798 is not allowed to leave its chamber without clearance from at least one Level 3 personnel. Any attempts to remove its gas mask must be approved by Site Director.

Description: SCP-1798 is a male monkey of the species Macaca fascicularis, standing at 1.2 meters tall and weighing 25 kilograms. SCP-1798's head is adorned with green hair in a purple cap and there is a goggle on its forehead. It also wears a jade earring on its left ear and a normal gas mask that is most often seen hanging around its neck.

SCP-1798 has a frightened mouth and ski goggle eyes, which seem to be perpetually wide open, suggesting heightened alertness. Its behavior exhibits a strong sense of independence, which often leads to disobedience regarding Site rules and regulations.

SCP-1798 works as a security guard in Site-19, however, it has been known to sneak out of the office early or take unauthorized leaves of absence. SCP-1798's rebellious tendencies have led to security breaches in the past, and it is imperative to remind personnel to monitor and contain SCP-1798 at all times.

Addendum-1798-A: Following Incident-1798-B, SCP-1798's containment was upgraded from Safe to Euclid. SCP-1798 was found in the cafeteria during a containment breach incident, claiming it needed a break from its post. During this incident, SCP-1798's gas mask was removed, causing an extreme and unexpected reaction including increased aggression and strength. It took several Level 4 personnel to subdue and recontain SCP-1798, confirming that its gas mask is an essential part of its containment protocol.
